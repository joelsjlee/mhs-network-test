						<p>Brisk Northwestern gale, and winter cold— I went to the Pension Office,
							and left with the Commissioner <persRef ref="edwards-james">James L.
								Edwards</persRef> a Letter of Enquiry from <persRef
								ref="parker-jonathan">Jonathan Parker</persRef> of Plympton relating
							to the act passed at the late session of Congress granting an additional
							pension for one year to certain widows of Revolutionary Officers and
							Soldiers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards gave me several printed
							copies of the Act, with a form of application by the widow to obtain the
							benefit of it, and promised to write me an answer to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker’s enquiries— I then went to
								<persRef ref="hunter-william7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hunter’s</persRef> chamber at the Department of State, and finished
							the extracts from <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler’s</persRef> Letter to the Secretary of State <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> of 17. June 1835— Neither this
							Letter, nor that of <persRef ref="slacum-william">W. A. Slacum</persRef>
							of 1. August 1835 was ever communicated to Congress; but in them
							originated the project of enlarging the encroachment upon Mexico from
							the mere acquisition of Texas, to embrace all New-Mexico, to the 37<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> parallel of Latitude, and thence across
							the continent to the South-Sea— Butler’s Letter connects with it a
							project for a commercial line of communication between the Arkansas
							river and the Colorado of California, uniting the Atlantic and Pacific
							Oceans— The Texian expedition of last year to Santa Fe, must have been a
							sucker from the same root— <persRef ref="jones-thomas">Ap Catesby
								Jones’s</persRef> occupation of Monterey— <persRef ref="linn-lewis"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Linn’s</persRef> bill for the
							organization of the Oregon territory: and above all the tampering of
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> with the Mexican
							Minister here, <persRef ref="almonte-juan">Almonte</persRef>, by a
							proposition that Mexico should cede to the United States the Port of San
							Francisco, and the parallel 36 of North Latitude across the continent to
							buy the consent of Great Britain with a cession to her from 49 to the
							Columbia river present altogether a spectacle and prospect truly
							appalling.— The root of the danger is in the convulsive impotence of
							Mexico to maintain her own integrity, geographical, political or moral,
							and the inflexible perseverance of rapacity of our South and West, under
							the spur of Slavery, to plunder and dismember her.— Butler’s bribe of
							half a million of dollars to the <persRef ref="hernandez-ignacio"
								>confessor</persRef> of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa
								Anna’s</persRef> sister was too gross even for <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> stomach to allow him to
							give it his official sanction—but even while ostensibly disapproving it,
							he sent him back to Mexico with liberty to try it in his own way; and it
							failed. <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef> of South
							Carolina tried it upon Santa Anna himself and failed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter brought me the volume of secret
							instructions to agents of foreign intercourse, and there I found a
							despatch of 14. January 1843. to the present Consul at the
								Havana<space/><persRef ref="campbell-robert3">Campbell</persRef> full of
							the most combustible matter, putrid with Slavery and the Slave trade— It
							announces the receipt of information from the Havana, and a highly
							respectable source, charging the English abolitionists and Government
							with a deliberate project to occupy and ruin the Island of Cuba— And the
							Consul is instructed to collect and transmit all possible information on
							the subject— Matter for more enquiry and deep meditation. The
							instructions promise that we will not permit Great-Britain to occupy the
							Island of Cuba— <persRef ref="greenough-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Morning service at the second Presbyterian church by the <persRef
								ref="mccarer-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Carer</persRef> of Philadelphia. He
							supplies the pulpit until the return of <persRef ref="ely-ezra">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezra Stiles Ely</persRef> from
							Missouri— When he rose in the pulpit I was struck with his resemblance
							to <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Robert Barnwell Rhett</persRef>, the
							member of Congress from South Carolina.— He read the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Luke, and commented shortly
							upon the parable of the unjust Steward, noticing the objections taken to
							the forms of expression importing that the Lord <hi rend="italic"
								>commended</hi> the unjust steward for the perpetration of an
							atrocious fraud, upon the general principle that the children of this
							world are wiser in their generation than the children of light— The
							words commended and wiser must be understood in an ironical sense; and
							yet it seems incongruous that the Lord, plundered by his faithless
							steward should commend him for the worldly wisdom of his device to
							indemnify himself for the loss of his place. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Carer’s text was from Revelation 22.11. [“]He that is
							unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be
							filthy still:” omitting the remainder of the verse:—“and he that is
							righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be
							holy still.”— The doctrine inferred from the text was that the
							retributions of the world to come will be eternal— A brief account of
							the composition of this book by <persRef ref="stjohnofpatmos">Saint
								John</persRef> in the island of Patmos was given— That is a prophesy
							of coming events till the end of the world— That this sentence in the
							closing chapter of the book has direct reference to the final
							consummation of all things— That it is equivalent to a positive
							declaration, that the wicked cannot change their nature after death—that
							they will continue wicked in the next world as they were in this, and
							their crimes and of course their punishments will endure, for endless
							ages— This is presbyterian creed, but very defective logic— The premises
							do not warrant the conclusion— Though it cannot be denied that the
							context gives countenance to the reasoning— <persRef ref="smith-stephen"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen D. Smith</persRef> dined
							with us— Afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church.
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the evening prayers for the fifth Sunday in
							Lent; and preached from Zechariah 4.10. “For who hath despised the day
							of small things?” Half a verse— A sentiment applicable to all human
							affairs; but here specially applied to the rebuilding of the temple of
							Jerusalem by <persRef ref="zorobabel">Zerubbabel</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley generalizes, and did not explain
							why the rebuilding of the Temple should be called the day of small
							things— The prophet <persRef ref="haggai">Haggai</persRef> had announced
							The glory of the latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith
							the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of
							hosts— <persRef ref="whittingham-william">Bishop Whittingham</persRef>

						<p>North-east wind—chill—damp—snow.</p>
						<p>Morning call from <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Heman Lincoln</persRef>— He is connected with the
							Baptist missions, and has been on an excursion into Virginia— He was
							inquisitive upon the prospects of the approaching Presidential election—
							He asked my opinion of the chances and agreed with me that the prospects
							were in favour of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van
								Buren</persRef>. He thought the prospects of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> as irretrievably gone: as I
							have no doubt they are— Those of <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>Tyler</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Cass</persRef>, are equally desperate—
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef> is the shadow of a
							shade, and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> is a
							Daguerrotype likeness of a candidate—all sunshine, through a camera
							obscura. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln’s partiality was for
								<persRef ref="frelinghuysen-theodore">Theodore
								Frelinghuysen</persRef> or <persRef ref="mclean-john2">judge John
								M’Lean</persRef> I had never heard the name of Frelinghuysen as a
							candidate before; and M’Lean, is but a second edition of John
							Tyler—vitally democratic, double-dealing and hypocritical— They will all
							go into the democratic convention, and all melt into the Corinthian
							brass of Kinderhoek. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lincoln urged me
							warmly to publish my Lecture upon Faith. I told him I had promised a
							copy of it for publication; but I supposed they had forgotten it, to the
							Trustees of the Warren Street Chapel Boston where it had been first
							delivered— I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln copies of my
							jubilee of the Constitution—of my speech of 14 and 15. April 1842 on War
							with Mexico and England—and of my Lecture on the social compact— I went
							to the Department of State, and saw <persRef ref="webster-fletcher"
								>Fletcher Webster</persRef> the chief clerk— The <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Secretary his father</persRef> left the City
							last Night for a visit of ten days to Boston— I gave the son a Letter
							from Plymouth for reference to the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef>, and went into <persRef ref="hunter-william7"
								>Hunter’s</persRef> chamber where I spent three hours in examining
							the instructions to <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler</persRef>, and their
							correspondence relating to the boundary with Mexico and to Texas— The
							enquiry deepens as I proceed; and I shall as usual be obliged to break
							it short off for want of time to find its sounding. The Chronology of
							the Negotiations for the acquisition of Texas and California would of
							itself be a labour of weeks, and yet without it I cannot master the
							subject for any useful result— Upon enquiry of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hunter for the Essays of <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Americanus and La Salle</persRef>, he brought me a thin volume of
							Missouri, and other Western Newspapers of the year 1829. forming a
							complete collection of those documents, none of which had I ever before
							seen— The first instructions under the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> administration on this subject was from Van Buren
							to Poinsett 25. August 1829—precisely at the time, when Benton was
							publishing Americanus and La Salle at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Louis. I have reading for at least a month opened to me by the cursory
							perusals of this day— I made up the minutes of the Committee of foreign
							Affairs.</p>

						<p>Snow— Rain— Snow.</p>
						<p>My cough has much abated, but has not wholly disappeared; nor can I
							expect that it ever will; but I am now confined almost entirely to the
							house by the weather—an easterly wind with alternate snow and rain
							having chilled and darkened the whole of this day— At home I took up the
							Message and documents relating to the seizure of Monterey by <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas">Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones</persRef>.— There
							is no warrant for it in any of his written instructions from the Navy
							Department— But I remark, with no small concern 1. the special charge of
							exploring the coast within the gulph of California and as high as the
							Port of San Francisco—one of the reasons of which is the weakness of the
							local authorities, and their irresponsibility to the distant government
							of Mexico. 2. The tone of intercourse both military and diplomatic,
							bearing upon Mexico— It would never have entered into the head of Jones
							to commit such an outrage upon a Nation whom he believed able to resent
							it— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef> diplomacy
							is in perfect keeping with this temper— Even his apologies are insolent,
							insulting, and contemptuous; and there is far too much of the same
							spirit in the notes of our <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of
								State</persRef>— The spirit of encroachment upon Mexico, is
							stimulated and nourished by this settled and but too well founded
							conviction of her helpless weakness in conflict with the gigantic energy
							of our national avarice and ambition— When I contemplate the prospect
							before us, my heart sinks within me for the cause of human freedom—and
							for our own— At the Department of State too I found matter for gloomy
							anticipations in the instructions of 13 Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>
							last to the Consul at the Havana <persRef ref="campbell-robert3">Robert
								B. Campbell</persRef> which discloses great alarm at the Havana and
							thence instigated here, at the supposed design of the British Government
							to take possession of the island of Cuba; and a real design at the
							Havana to urge us to be before hand with Britain, by taking it
							ourselves. The Secretary of State tells the Consul in a very trenchant
							tone that we shall not permit Great-Britain to take possession of Cuba—
							The real fact I suppose to be that the British Government are turning
							the screws upon the importation of Slaves into the island and that they
							can no longer in defiance of all Law, and all Treaty, openly gorge their
							markets with 25000 bozal negroes every year— The Havana has been and is
							one of the last inexpugnable haunts of the African Slave trade pirates.
							I received Letters this day—one from <persRef ref="curtis-benjamin">B.
								R. Curtis</persRef>, reminding me of my conditional engagement to
							deliver next August the anniversary discourse to the alumni of Harvard
							University, and one from <persRef ref="savage-james">James
								Savage</persRef>, for the anniversary of 29. May—</p>

						<p>The Snow has disappeared, but there is yet no symptom of Spring. <persRef
								ref="freeman-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Freeman</persRef> was again here this morning. He went to Norfolk,
							but remained there only a few days— Since he came back he has had a long
							interview with the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, and
							has written a tart Letter to the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of
								the Navy</persRef>. He has preferred charges against <persRef
								ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Henderson</persRef>, which the Secretary refuses to entertain—
							Freeman says that <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> advised
							Upshur to sustain Henderson because he was a Virginian against Freeman
							who was nothing but a Yankee. The Colonel has obtained an informal
							permission to be absent for an indefinite time from his station at
							Norfolk, but no encouragement to expect a resto-rastoration to Boston—
							He is brooding over a memorial to Congress, against Henderson, and
							perhaps against the Secretary of the Navy, Upshur. He asked me, if he
							could depend upon <persRef ref="parmenter-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parmenter</persRef> to present his
							memorial. I said any member from Massachusetts could present the
							memorial if he insisted upon it; but I could not advise the measure, for
							he would have all the Executive, and all the Virginia influence against
							him, besides that of Henderson himself and of his family, which was very
							great— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Freeman seemed to believe that
							Congress would easily be persuaded to abolish the Office of Colonel of
							the Marine Corps, which he believed to be altogether useless; but then
							the Office would devolve upon the Lieutenant Colonel—that is, upon
							himself— <persRef ref="beck-lambert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beck</persRef> came with a subscription paper, for the purchase of a
							collection of coins or medals, of sundry kings of England and France,
							from <persRef ref="wyatt-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wyatt</persRef>, for the National Institute. I spent again about 3
							hours at the Department of State, examining the correspondence of
								<persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler</persRef> with the
							Department concerning his Negotiation for the purchase of Texas— He was
							himself a speculator in Texian lands.— First despatched with the
							Instructions of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> of 29. Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1829. His first Letter is from Attakapas
							17. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1829. complaining of having been
							delayed on the road by sickness— On that same day, Poinsett’s Letter of
							recall was signed and a long jesuitical Letter of Instructions to
							himself as Chargé d’Affaires, to which Office he had been appointed on
							the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October— There is some
							mystification in these dates; probably explainable.— Butlers second
							Letter is from Bexar, near the river Nueces, in Texas<space/>November 1829.
							and the third 31. December 1829 from the City of Mexico. Poinsett
							departed immediately after loaded with execrations, and <persRef
								ref="guerrero-vincenta">Guerrero’s</persRef> government was in the
							agonies of dissolution— I enquired of <persRef ref="hunter-william7"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef>, if any answer
							had been received from <persRef ref="campbell-robert3">Robert
								Campbell</persRef>, the Consul at the Havana to the secret
							instructions of 14. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last and he brought
							me the answer dated 9. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1843.— He
							discredits entirely the secret informer’s tale about the intention of
							the British Government to take possession of the Island of Cuba: but
							joins in holy horror of the English abolitionists, and is in full
							confidential communication with <persRef ref="valdes-jeronimo">General
								Valdez</persRef> the present Governor General— <persRef

							went accordingly and found him with <persRef ref="burnell-judith">his

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> M Daniel’s</persRef>, under a cough
							worse than mine, and expectoration of blood, which he says comes not
							from the lungs but from the throat— He thinks himself convalescent and
							almost wholly recovered. But he shewed me a respirator which he had sent
							for to New-York, an invention of which I had never before heard, but to
							be used by personals with pulmonary complaints for breathing fresh air,
							softened by the medium through which it passes— <persRef

							and <persRef ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L. Williams</persRef>, who

							papers, for some account of the New England Colonial confederacy of the
								16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century, but I had no time for

							an explanation of an entry on the printed journal of the House, of 22<hi

							1842 “The reception of these petitions was objected to; and the question

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burche the written proof in my own list of
							the petitions presented by me, which I had given to him with the

						<p>Spring is at last setting in; the sky is clear, and the atmosphere balmy;
							but the effect on the bodily frame relaxing into extreme lassitude and
							imbecility— I awoke about 3 this morning with a fit of severe coughing,
							and a muddy head-ache which passed off before breakfast, but left me
							drowsy and torpid throughout the day— <persRef ref="child-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Child</persRef> called on me, and gave
							me the first sheet of a pamphlet which he is publishing on the Texan
							Revolution, and the late outrage in California.— I had a long
							conversation with him on this and other consanguineous subjects, and I
							advised him to keep his eye steadily fixed on occuring events in the
							island of Cuba— He told me, that <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef> had within a few day renewed his propositions to
								<persRef ref="almonte-juan">General Almonte</persRef>, for a cession
							by Mexico of six degrees of Latitude along the shores of the pacific,
							and the parallel of 36 across the continent.<space/>strike the Arkansas
							river. This would include Monterey of California and Santa Fe of
							New-Mexico— I called upon General Almonte himself and he told me that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had renewed the proposal for
							the cession, the other day, when they exchanged the ratifications of the
							recent Convention for the payment of the adjudicated claims— There are
							rumours coming from New Orleans that <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio"
								>Santa Anna</persRef> had released a <persRef ref="robinson-james"
								>judge Robinson</persRef>, one of the Texian prisoners taken in
							their late predatory expedition, and through him had made overtures
							towards the recognition of the Independence of Texas— Almonte said he
							had no doubt that judge Robinson had been released, but he believed not
							a word of his being charged with any proposal for recognizing the
							independence of Texas— For he knew that Santa Anna considered the
							recovery of Texas as vital to the existence of the Mexican Republic, and
							he had the day before yesterday received Letters from Santa Anna, of
							very recent date which gave no intimation of any such proposed
							negotiation; which he thinks there must have been if it had been
							contemplated— Especially as he himself had been a prisoner in Texas with
							Santa-Anna, and was perfectly acquainted with all his views concerning
							that territory— I spoke of the rumours that Great Britain had offered
							her mediation between Texas and Mexico— He said the British Consul had
							made an informal tender of such a mediation—but it had been rejected
							with an expression of surprize that Great Britain should undertake to
							negotiate for the Independence of Texas, knowing as she did that the
							revolt of that Province had originated and was to be consummated solely
							for the reinstitution of Slavery which had been abolished by Mexico.—
							There is now a rumour that Great Britain has offered Texas, to mediate
							for her Independence with Mexico, on condition that Texas shall abolish
							Slavery. Almonte said he knew nothing of that— He promised to call on me
							before I leave the City— I went to the Department of State and looked
							again for about an hour into <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler’s</persRef> correspondence, but could not command my own
							attention and came home. <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H.

							offered by me on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of February under

							Committee— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> alone voted
							against them on the ground that they called for <hi rend="italic"

								>Granger</persRef> immediately moved the previous question <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> shuffled it off for that day by
							calling at the expiration of the morning hour, for the orders of the

							were taken upon the resolutions. ay 116. of whom 23 democrats, and only
							two Virginia whigs, <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Stuart</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers</persRef>. Nay 69. of whom 11.
							Virginians, <persRef ref="barton-richard">Barton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="powell-cuthbert">Powell</persRef>, whigs, of the number—
							Cushing asked to be and was excused from voting— The Message notices the
							omission of the usual exception in the Resolutions; asserts the right of
							the executive to withhold the communication of papers which he deems
							improper for publication; but says he has in this case communicated all,
							perceiving no necessity to withhold any— Tyler’s arbitrary Spirit, and
							his flinching practice, have been signally manifested throughout this
							whole transaction— The document itself is full of matter for future
							consideration and commentary— I spent again three hours at the
							Department of State, hurrying over <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler’s</persRef> correspondence, especially on the negociations
							for Texas—with regard to which there are three classes of papers—Public
							despatches and private Letters to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Secretary of State</persRef>, and private Letters to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>— There is no record
							of the President’s Letters to him— It was one of Jackson’s practices to
							hold private and secret correspondences upon the most important public
							affairs, without leaving any copies of his own Letters or instructions
							in the Departments. A most irregular, mischievous and imminently
							dangerous exercise of power, for which the Constitution provides no
							remedy.— One of its effects is that there is no trace of Anthony Butler,
							till his appointment in August 1829 as bearer of despatches to <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> instructing him to open
							without delay a negotiation for the purchase of as much of the province
							of Texas as could be obtained— How he came to be at Washington in August

							him, and I have no doubt that he was deeply involved in Texian land

						<p>Palm Sunday.</p>
						<p>At the second presbyterian church this morning, <persRef
								ref="mccarer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Carer</persRef> preached from Psalm 84–11. [“]For the Lord God is
							a sun and shield: The Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will
							he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” The Sermon began with the
							usual clerical rather than critical sweeping assertion of the immense
							superiority for sublimity of the Psalms over every merely human
							composition— A matter about which after a rigorous comparison with the
							Odes of <persRef ref="pindar">Pindar</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="horace">Horace</persRef>, especially the carmen saeculare, I
							have some doubts— The preacher said further that this 84<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> psalm was very beautiful, as it is in
							the asiatic or oriental Stile— That it was believed to be from the pen
							of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> written at the time of his
							expulsion from Jerusalem by the revolt of his unnatural, and rebellious
							son <persRef ref="absalom">Absalom</persRef>— Of which I perceive no
							evidence external or internal— The Psalmist pours out his Soul in
							extasies of desire to enjoy the privilege of devotion in the tabernacles
							of the Lord of Hosts— There is no allusion direct or indirect to the
							rebellion of Absalom; nor to a calamitous condition as the source of
							inspiration— There was then some comment upon the aptitude of
							illustration in the imagery representing God, as at once a Sun and a
							shield— A Sun—the idolatry of Nature— The Sun—of all the visible
							creation, the object of the greatest beneficence to man.— The source of
							light and heat—all splendour to the eye— The Parent of all production
							for nourishment and subsistence believed by the antient Parsees and the
							modern Parsees to be God himself or the abode of the deity— Then a
							shield. In those antient day the emblem of protection from all danger,
							because an effectual guard against every weapon of assault whether of
							sword, falchion, arrow, javelin or spear, before the invention of
							firearms— Then the comforting promise of the gifts of grace and glory;
							and the delightful assurance that he will withhold no good thing, from
							them that walk uprightly.— The good hearted presbyterian seemed for the
							moment to have forgotten the atonement by the blood of the lamb—
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> dined with us—
							After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the evening service for the sixth Sunday in Lent and preached from
							1. Peter 4.17.—what shall the end be, of them that obey not the
							gospel of God? He gave notice that during the coming Passion week,
							there would be service every morning at the Church, and on Thursday
								<persRef ref="whittingham-william">Bishop Whittingham</persRef>
							would confer the rite of confirmation at 1/2 past 4 p.m.— On Good
							Friday—service morning and afternoon— After Church, I called and saw
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								T. B. Johnson</persRef>— And then visited by request <persRef

								<persRef ref="damon-john">Damon</persRef>, who for many years his
							agent in the business and grown rich in the agency, took out the patent
							in his own name, and grasped at the whole profits of the trade for

							appealed to the Supreme Court at Madrid— This Court they say cannot
							reverse the decisions of the Colonial Courts, but may delay their
							execution, and in the meantime M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor’s
							privilege is suspended— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart gave me
							a Letter to her from her brother <persRef ref="tudor-henry">Henry

							write to <persRef ref="rodil-jose">General Rodil</persRef>, minister of

							with the despatches from the department of State, by the Steam packet,
							to sail on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> from New-York— This
							morning I groped again three hours into the despatches of <persRef
								ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler</persRef> at the Department of
							State— The three-fold and double dealing line of negotiation 1. for a
							commercial Treaty 2. indemnity for all sorts of claims and 3. to strip
							Mexico of Texas, Santa Fe, and California, and annex them all to this
							union, runs into the most curious details of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>Tyler</persRef> duplicity. Butler’s Letter of 17. June 1835 to
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, suppressed in the
							communication of 4 July 1838 to the House of Representatives is the
							Passe par tout of the whole system pursued with inflexible perseverance
							down to this hour— I met at the Department, <persRef ref="brown-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Brown</persRef>, who is
							going out as Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands— As I was returning
							home from the Department, I met <persRef ref="mayo-robert">D<hi

							to attend the wedding of his niece at his house this day at 1/2 past 3—

						<p><persRef ref="hunter-william2">Lieutenant Hunter</persRef> of the Navy,
							called on me this morning and asked me to examine his new invented war

							his lodgings at <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef> hotel—
							I promised to call there and see it at 11. O’Clock to-morrow morning— He
							gave me Senate document 244. of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of
							March last, the last day of the last Session—being a Report made by him
							to the Naval Committees of the two houses, after examination by them of
							his Steamer on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February— The
							report was presented to the Senate by <persRef ref="bayard-richard">M<hi

							horizontal propeller of the boat, substituted, for the paddlewheels of

							in the Clerk’s Office <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Edward

								Elmore</persRef>, heretofore a member of Congress from
							South-Carolina, and in the Capitol-yard <persRef ref="everett-horace"
								>Horace Everett</persRef>, who told me that he expected to remain
							here about a fortnight longer— I was desirous of completing a file of
							Documents concerning our relations with Mexico and Texas: and had made
							out a list from the Index to the House Documents from 1831 to 1839— I
							obtained a considerable number of them; but of several of the most

							visit <persRef ref="burnell-barker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burnell</persRef>, who is yet confined to his chamber, though
							convalescent— The assortment of my pamphlets to have them bound up in
							volumes, not only absorbs an enormous quantity of time, but consumes the
							labour of the mind, which should be devoted to productive thought, and
							terminates in distraction—day after day passes off and the time is gone—
							To concentrate my reflections upon one of the numerous projects floating
							in my brain I began yesterday an address to my late constituents of the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> late, and my future constituents of
							the present 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> congressional districts of
							Massachusetts, which if I have the courage and perseverance to finish
							it, I may deliver as a Lecture before the commencement of the next
							Session of Congress. I know not how this may succeed—the time is not
							propitious for me to speak to my countrymen unpalatable truths—but I
							wish to leave behind me something which may keep alive the flame of
							liberty and preserve it in that conflict between Slavery and freedom
							which is drawing to its crisis and which is to brighten or to darken the
							condition of the human race upon earth— I wrote this Evening a short
							Letter to <persRef ref="irving-washington">Washington Irving</persRef>
							at Madrid, and received one from <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi

						<p>The work upon which I have at length undertaken to concentrate the
							employment of my leisure time and the result of my meditations, in the
							form of an address to my constituents past and future deepens in
							interest as I proceed; and widens in the list of topics which I propose
							to discuss— Already I perceive that one discourse of two hours duration
							will not suffice to unburden my heart of the sentiments and opinions
							which I believe vital to the happiness, peace and future liberty of this
							great people— Whether any thing that I can do or say, will avail to save
							and preserve them from the dangers with which they are beset; or to
							avert the Catastrophe impending over them, an all wise Providence will
							decide— The prospect of the future is deeply discouraging; but
							despondency would surrender the cause; and exertion even if fruitless
							will be sanctified by the motive for using it— I called at 11. this
							morning at <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef> hotel, and
							examined the model Steamer of <persRef ref="hunter-william2">Lieut<hi

							which the paddlewheels are under water on the two sides and close to the

							itself at the Navy-yard. Thence I went and smothered three hours more at
							the Department of State in rapid survey of <persRef ref="butler-anthony"
								>Anthony Butler’s</persRef> correspondence— This man was in the last

								>th.</hi> Regiment of infantry; appointed as a citizen of Kentucky—

							that he was many years an intimate and confidential friend of <persRef

							New-Orleans campaign.— His appointment in 1829 as bearer of despatches
							to <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>, and afterwards as
							chargé d’Affaires to Mexico, was as a Citizen of Mississippi, and he was
							at that very time a jobber in Texian Lands— His looseness of moral
							principle, and political profligacy as disclosed in several of his
							Letters— His vanity and self sufficiency in others— He boasts of his
							address in managing <persRef ref="alaman-lucas">Lucas Alaman</persRef>,
							by mystifing a little, and while under the shield of diplomatic

						<p>Rainy day— At my request my nephew <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Hull
								Adams</persRef> went to <persRef ref="hunter-william2">Lieutenant
								Hunter</persRef> and proposed to postpone to a fair day my visit
							with him to his Steamer Union at the Navy Yard—to which he readily
							assented— I received this morning from <persRef ref="hughes-jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah Hughes</persRef> of Baltimore, the present publisher of
								<persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles</persRef> National Register the
							missing numbers of the 62 and 63 volumes which I had written to him to
							obtain— I took them to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and
							left them there to be bound— I saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> there somewhat
							perplexed by the publication of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s</persRef> letter to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, recently despatched
							and which he is instructed to read to <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord
								Aberdeen</persRef>, and give him a copy of it, if desired— Gales
							asked me if it was usual in negotiation to publish in the newspapers
							controversial notes, before they have been received by the parties to
							whom they are addressed— I told him it was not usual heretofore; but
							that of late years all negotiation is little more than a perpetual
							appeal to public opinion, and the negotiators little more than advocates
							before the tribunal of the civilized world— I referred him to the case
							of the Spanish Minister <persRef ref="pizarro-martinez"
								>Pizarro</persRef> who in 1818 addressed to <persRef
								ref="erving-george">George W. Erving</persRef> Minister of the U.S.
							in Spain a manifesto against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> invasion of Florida, equivalent to a declaration
							of War, and before waiting for our reception of it; published it in a
							Hamburg Gazette whence it was circulated all over Europe. In return for
							which my answer of Instructions to Erving, was communicated to Congress,
							and published all over the Union, before it could reach the Spanish
							Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the Counterpart to his manifesto— Other
							instances of more recent occurrence were referred to in the case of
								<persRef ref="gorostiza-manuel">Gorostiza’s</persRef> pamphlet
							published here in 1836. of <persRef ref="cass-lewis">General
								Cass’s</persRef> publication of his preposterous protest against the
							ratification by France of the Quintuple Treaty, and the triangular
							debates between the British Parliament the French Legislative chambers,
							and the North American Congress like a game of Chess played by
							correspondence between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, or between
							Nova Zembla and New-Zealand— I visited <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Edward Stanly</persRef>, <persRef ref="childs-timothy">Timothy
								Childs</persRef>, and <persRef ref="clark-john">John C.
								Clark</persRef> at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Owner’s</persRef> on the Capitol hill— Met them at their own door,
							just returned from a visit with Lieutenant Hunter to his Steamer Union,
							with which they are much pleased— Clark has just buried his lovely
							daughter <persRef ref="clark-josephine">Josephine</persRef>, in her
								15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, a school companion of our
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>— Stanly starts for
							home to-morrow morning—still uncertain whether he will be nominated for
							re-election to the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress or not.
							Childs is still detained here by sickness but looks convalescent— At the
							document room of the house I obtained two copies of the Message of 14
							July 1842. containing part of the peppery correspondence between Webster
							and <persRef ref="bocanegra-jose">Bocanegra</persRef></p>

						<p><date>14. IV.30. </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>Another day of solitude; rain and gloom with the exception of a three
							hours visit to the Department of State— There, the progress of my
							enquiries into the biography of <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson’s</persRef> projected dismemberment of Mexico, is disturbed
							and protracted by the daily occurrence of new incidents which consume
							the time and divert my attention from the main object of my pursuit— I
							found at the Office this day four different weekly newspapers in the
							month of March down to the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— 1. The
							Civilian and Galveston City Gazette, published at Galveston. 2 The
							Telegraph and Texas Register, at Houston— 3. The Texian and Brazos
							farmer, at Washington; and 4. The western Advocate, at the City of
							Austin—a new paper of which I had before seen the first number.— These
							papers are of opposite political parties are highly excited partizans
							for and against their <persRef ref="houston-samuel">President Samuel
								Houston</persRef>; all passionately devoted to the lone star of
							Texas; all of the Catonian school, exterminating War upon Mexico; and
							all panting for annexation to the United States— <persRef
								ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W. Gilmer’s</persRef> Letter is in one of
							them with a warm commendation of its object and argument; an earnest
							exhortation to the Texians to gather up their forces for a renewed
							application to our Congress at their next long Session, with assurance
							of kind support from <persRef ref="tyler-john">our amiable
								President</persRef>, and an easy disposal of the opposition of Johny
							Q— <persRef ref="robinson-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Robinson</persRef> was at Galveston, with the compromise
							propositions of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa Anna</persRef>
							which will be rejected with disdain—and <persRef ref="rusk-thomas"
								>Rusk</persRef>, the appointed Major General, was breathing blood
							and slaughter for the invasion of Mexico, if he could but get hold of
							the Law for his own appointment— <persRef ref="hunter-william7">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef> furnished me a new
							Map of Texas—<persRef ref="austin-stephen">Austin’s</persRef>, published
							by <persRef ref="tanner-henry">Tanner</persRef> in 1840. and shewed me
							another despatch from <persRef ref="eve-joseph">Joseph Eve</persRef>,
							dated at Galveston 29. March— In the midst of all her vices,
							difficulties and troubles, Texas is swelling with incredible rapidity
							into a formidable Slave State which Mexico can never recover, and from
							the contamination of whose Slavery nothing can save this Union, short of
							a special interposition of Providence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hunter produced to me also this day a private note dated 25 July 1835.
							signed <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">A. J.</persRef> and directed to the
							then Secretary of State <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
							>Forsyth</persRef>—proposing additional Instructions to Butler to offer
							half a million more, for the line of the Rio del Norte from its mouth to
							the 37<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> degree of Latitude and thence
							straight to the pacific— This note was the seminal principle of the
							Instruction from Forsyth to Butler of 6. August 1835—published in Doc<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> 42. p. 18. of Message 3. Oct<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1837.— In the regular examination of
							Butler’s despatches I have only reached his Letter of 25. May 1831.
							refering to and answering one from him of 24 March 1831. which is not at
							the Department. I continue to write morning and evening on the proposed
							address to my constituents, but begin to shrink from the task.</p>

						<p>Come—gentle Spring! etherial mildness! come. She is here! and brings to
							me uninterrupted leisure, instead of which this daily record, my
							brooding address to my Constituents, and my researches at the Department
							of State, fill to the brim every vacant hour, and keep me on the rack of
							overplied occupation as laborious as at the busiest period of the
							Session of Congress— Meanwhile my correspondence runs into irredeemable
							arrears and my private affairs and impending duties are neglected— One
							thing at a time was the maxim of <persRef ref="dewitt-john">John de
								Witt</persRef>— Too many irons in the fire at once is the fatal flaw
							in my economy of time. It was past one O’Clock this afternoon when I
							reached my table in <persRef ref="hunter-william7">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter’s</persRef> chamber at the
							Department of State— He was not there— In pursuing the correspondence of
								<persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler</persRef> I find a
							Letter from him to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef> of 25. May 1831. extracts only from which were
							communicated to H.R.U.S. in document 351. p 382—where a line of stars
							represent two most important pages of the despatch— Jackson, in a Letter
							to him of 24. March 1831 had complained of not hearing from him later
							than the preceding November— This despatch is a long and laboured
							apology for delay in the Texian Negotiation, but he proves 1. that this
							delay had been expressly enjoined by <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van
								Buren’s</persRef> instructions to him, as well as by his own
							convictions of expediency, and 2. he proves the shortness of Jackson’s
							memory in pretending that he had received nothing from him of later date
							than November, by referring to a publication in the Washington Telegraph
							of a paper transmitted by Butler to him with a despatch dated in
							January— This is one of the numberless instances of Jackson’s reckless
							disregard to truth, when the impatience of his temper betrays the
							frailty of his memory— Jackson’s passion for the acquisition of Texas
							was intense. Butler was a Texian land-jobber, who treated Jackson, as he
							boasts of having treated <persRef ref="alaman-lucas">Alaman</persRef>,
							the Mexican Secretary of State and negotiator with him— “Mystified a
							little so as to leave him not without hope.” Alaman and Butler played a
							game of tame cheating in which each intended to overreach the other—
							Butler mystified with Alaman and Alaman mystified with Butler.— Alaman
							was the shrewdest knave of the two— When Butler wrote this despatch he
							had just discovered that Alaman had made him his dupe; and he with
							ludicrous gravity discloses his first doubts of Mexican sincerity He
							advises Jackson to insult <persRef ref="montoya-ignacio"
								>Montoya</persRef> who coming out to supersede <persRef
								ref="tornel-jose">Tornel</persRef> as the Mexican charge d’Affaires,
							and give him to understand that Mexico was of very little account with
							us— <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef> took
							the place of Martin Van Buren as Secretary of State on the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May 1831. and his correspondence with
							Butler began with a sharp altercation about some irregularity in
							Butler’s accounts. The Galveston civilian of 29. March the comment on
								<persRef ref="robinson-james">Robinson’s</persRef> mission, and on
								<persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W. Gilmer’s</persRef> Letter are to
							be remembered— Short walks before and after dinner. <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> was here this morning,
							and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> took tea and spent
							the Evening here— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> dined

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 70. No fire in my chamber— Heard at the second Presbyterian
							church <persRef ref="mccarer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Carer</persRef>, from Isaiah 57.21. [“]There is no peace, saith my
							God, to the wicked.” The discourse began with a dissertation upon the
							disposition natural to all mankind to seek for peace or happiness, in
							which he prosified Pope’s invocation— O! happiness our beings end and
							aim—or <persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Otium divos rogat
							impotente, Prensus AEgeo.— This is a hacknied commonplace. He then
							adduced as instances of the torture of remorse suffered by the wicked in
							the cases of <persRef ref="cain">Cain</persRef>—of <persRef
								ref="kingsaul">Saul</persRef>—and of <persRef ref="judas-iscariot"
								>Judas Iscariot</persRef>— He then described the distress and
							uneasiness always experienced by vicious persons specifying only the
							Miser and the sensualist— This list might have been much enlarged, and
							sharply pointed to exhibit the real wicked intended by the text— The
							preacher finally addressed his very scanty auditory and enquired whether
							among them there were not some who felt themselves included within this
							denunciation—exhorting them with great earnestness to work out their own
							salvation, by the consciousness of their own depravity, and of their own
							inability to save themselves— The main difficulty for this text is to
							affix a precise idea to the word wicked. In the general doctrine of
							human depravity, I concur, I hope in humility and sincerity, with
							fervent prayer for divine aid in self chastisement and correction— But I
							was not much disturbed by this malediction upon the wicked, by the fear
							that it includes me— I confess my unworthiness, and labour to redeem
							myself from it—relying only upon the mercy of my maker— The house was
							nearly empty, and from the urgency of his prayer that God would provide
							a pastor after his own heart for this people, I inferred that the
								<persRef ref="ely-ezra">Reverend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ely</persRef> has finally declined their invitation to him to come
							to them I attended the afternoon service at S<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver
								Abbot Shaw</persRef>, of Philadelphia, read prayers for the evening
							of Easter day and preached from John 11.25. “Jesus said unto her ‘I am
							the resurrection and the life.[’]” The preacher observed that this day
							being devoted to the celebration of Christs own resurrection, this
							saying of his on the occasion of his raising <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef> from the dead seemed appropriate to the devotion
							of the day; and remarked upon the peculiar energy of the words, being at
							the third demonstration given of his power to raise the dead—the first
							being in the case of <persRef ref="jairus">Jairus’s</persRef> daughter
							and the second in that of the widow’s Son at Nain. And here he claimed
							to be the resurrection itself because as <persRef ref="adam"
								>Adam</persRef> in his fall had represented the whole human race, so
							Christ in his own resurrection equally reprented that of all
							mankind.</p>

						<p>Rain again no inconsiderable part of the day. The address to my
							constituents, and my investigations daily at the Department of State,
							into our public relations with Mexico and Texas, all have one object,
							the contribution of my last public labours to the cause of human
							freedom, in its present and impending conflict with Slavery. The field
							is too vast for me: An address of two hours which I am proposing to
							prepare will scarcely skim the surface of the subject; and the dangers
							of the undertaking are more appalling than its toils— But I must pass
							on— Sursum corda! The preacher whom I heard at Saint John’s church
							yesterday afternoon, <persRef ref="shaw-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaw</persRef>, called on me this morning, and had with
							me a conversation of more than two hours. He is a native of Lexington,
							Massachusetts, and is now a settled minister of the episcopal church at
							Philadelphia and a professor at the high school in that city— His
							grandfather was an inhabitant of Lexington, when the revolutionary War
							commenced with the bloody conflict of that spot and shared in it. He was
							also at the battle of Bunker’s hill, and an ardent patriot of the
							Revolution, and lived and died a country farmer at Lexington.— He had
							always a strong and bitter prejudice against England and every thing
							English, and once in riding down to Cambridge with his grandson when a
							boy, and pointing out to him the university buildings as they passed
							along, the boy seeing the episcopal church on the other side of the
							square enquired what that was, and he answered that is the tory meeting
							house— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw told me other anecdotes of
							his own life, and made numerous enquiries relating to mine which I
							readily answered— He said it was so dark yesterday afternoon that he
							could not see to read a written sermon which he had in his pocket, and
							was obliged to extemporize which he did— He enquired much as to my
							practice of extempore speaking, which I acknowledged was wretchedly
							imperfect, but which yet was such as anxious labour and unwearied pains
							have been able to make it— I considered it as an art for the gift of
							which the seeds of which are given by nature to be cultivated by intense
							study and matured by frequent practice and long experience.— My own
							original portion of the seed being next to nothing, my cultivation of it
							inadequate— My experience much interrupted and my practice like every
							thing about me unsystematic, confused and drowsy.— At the department of
							State my progress with <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler</persRef> is provokingly slow.— <persRef
								ref="hunter-william7">Hunter</persRef> shewed me a Letter from the
							Sandwich Island Commissioners <persRef ref="haalilio-timoteo"
								>Halilio</persRef> and <persRef ref="richards-william2"
								>Richards</persRef> to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">D.
								Webster</persRef>, of 3. March 1843. who say <persRef
								ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef> declined to acknowledge
							the Independence of the Islands, because we had not acknowledged it, and
							were endeavouring to obtain exclusive privileges for ourselves— Also a
							Letter from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis Missouri, claiming to
							be recognized as Consul from Texas at that place. <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> who has just received
							his Commission of Lieutenant came and took leave, going home on a
							furlough for 3 weeks; and then ordered to the coast of Africa. <persRef

						<p>Dull weather and chilly atmosphere— <persRef ref="sewall-joseph2">D<hi

							informed me that he proposed to leave the city next Monday to embark in
							the Steamer at Boston for Liverpool for the purpose of visiting the
							medical schools in England, Scotland and Ireland— Then those of the
							continent of Europe, Holland, France, Germany, including Hamburg,
							Berlin, Vienna, and Italy, and to return home by next October— He
							repeated a request he had heretofore made that I would furnish him with
							a Letter, and I promised him one to <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>— In the course of my address I find occasion every
							now and then to state a fact, for the authentication of which I must
							have recourse to a document; and that puts me upon a chase which always
							consumes hours, and often leaves me disappointed, having found every
							thing that I did not, want, and failed to find precisely what I did. At
							the department of State this day I was disconcerted in the examination
							of <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butlers</persRef> negotiations
							from the condition of his correspondence— The negotiation for the
							commercial treaty was open and ostensible <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Poinsett</persRef> had on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							January 1828. concluded with the then Mexican Government two separate
							Treaties one of Commerce and one of limits— From the time of the Mexican
							Declaration of Independence, she had assumed the boundary agreed upon by
							us with Spain in the Florida Treaty, as the existing boundary between
							her and us, to which we had assented in 1824. Poinsett, under
							Instructions from <persRef key="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef>, approved
							by me had proposed and urged the purchase of Texas for one million of
							dollars, which Mexico had rejected and refused to conclude a Treaty of
							Commerce unless with another, confirming the Florida Treaty line
							boundary.— The two Treaties were to be ratified, and their ratifications
							exchanged within four months from their date, but they were not. When
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> came in, after some
							time the Negotiations were renewed to revise the commercial Treaty, but
							Jackson proposed anew the purchase of Texas for which he authorised the
							offer of 5. millions of dollars, while at the same time <persRef
								ref="houston-samuel">Sam Houston</persRef> went into Texas to kindle
							an internal insurrection and separate Texas from Mexico— Poinsett Was
							recalled and Butler was charged with the double negotiation— Poinsett’s
							Treaty of limits was reconcluded, and his commercial Treaty revised and
							altered— The two new Treaties were signed by Butler, and on the part of
							Mexico by <persRef ref="alaman-lucas">Alaman</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mangino-rafael">Manjino</persRef> on the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1831. They were to be ratified
							and the ratifications exchanged within one year from the date and on the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1832. Jackson issued his
							proclamation declaring that the ratifications of both Treaties had been
							exchanged. (more to morrow). <persRef ref="child-david">David L.

								Croghan</persRef> called on me this morning to borrow 250 dollars of

							for my dwelling house sold to <persRef ref="morsell-richard"
								>Morsell</persRef> part of my real Estate, which I cannot reinvest
							but must consume in my current household expenses— I declined therefore
							with suitable civility. Going to the Department of State, I met <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb
								Cushing</persRef>, who has returned here, after a short visit to his
							late constituents— Before he went he gave out that he would offer

							failed him, and he requested his friends not to put him in nomination—
							But he still considers himself a public man, and though thrice rejected
							by the Senate on the nomination for Secretary of the Treasury; he
							evidently still relies upon the fixed fact as the open Sesame, to the
							precious vaults. He told me, he expected to remain here about ten days.—

							and of his intention to take San Francisco if Mexico and U.S should
							prove to be at War or if it should burn out as was rumoured that Mexico
							had ceded California to Great-Britain. All which M<hi rend="superscript"

							Caraccas mentions the arrival there of a Mexican Commissioner bound to
							Lima in Peru where a Congress of South Americans were convening, said to
							be to form a league of defence against the grasping designs of the
							United States upon Mexico— Hall is Chargé d’Affaires of the United
							States to the Republic of Venezuela—and thinks this league against our
							usurpations very ridiculous— He says it is not at all approved in
							Venezuela and they certainly will not <unclear>seen</unclear> a Commissioner to the
							Assembly. <persRef ref="hunter-william2">Lieutenant Hunter</persRef>
							came and said he was ordered with his Steamer Union to Norfolk and must
							go on Saturday. He invited me to visit her at 4 O’Clock this afternoon,
							which I did, with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef>— We
							rode down to the Arsenal. Lieutenant Hunter came in the Steamer’s barge,
							and took us to her, in the channel at the mouth of the Eastern Branch.
							We spent about an hour on board and inspected her organization,
							arrangements and machinery. Lieutenant Hunter then landed us in the same
							boat and we got home before Sunset.</p>

							Campbell was here and left the city on the<space/>of January last—since

								ref="hawley-williams">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> to explain and reconcile me to a total evisceration
							of the pews and reorganization of them to raise money for paying off the

							examination of <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony Butler’s</persRef>
							correspondence— In 1833 <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio">Santa

							Butler is consulted by persons whom he does not name to know if the
							Government or capitalists in the United States will make a loan to
							Mexico, he says not for how much— He advises to turn it into a bargain
							for the sale of Texas, or a loan upon mortgage which they will certainly
							never redeem.— He addresses this in a private Letter to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, who instrucks <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Livingston</persRef> to reject at once the
							loan, and to write forthwith to Butler, to bring his negotiation to a

							American Colonists in Coahuila; are to hold a convention and declare
							their Independence,—after which he says it will be useless to treat with
							Mexico for Texas— Livingston instructs Butler accordingly, but Butler
							hangs on— This precise knowledge of Jackson to a day of the intended
							design of the Colonists to declare their independence as early as April
							1833. was suppressed in the document communicated to the House in 1833—
							I walked before dinner. left my watch chain at <persRef

							by <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth’s</persRef> Letter of 6. August

							between the manuscript and the printed documents is the unscrupulous
							suppression, upon a call from the house for all the correspondence at a
							crisis when the President had actually asked of Congress authority to
							wage war, of every scrap of paper, which it did not suit to make public—
							It proves how utterly inefficient, the reservation of the power of
							declaring War, to Congress is, as a check upon the will of the President
							to wage it—is— My progress in examining Butler’s correspondence at the
							Department of State is so slow that I shall be obliged to break it up
							without getting half through— The Steamer Britannia which brought
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett’s</persRef> answer to

						<p>At the second Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="mccarer-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Carer</persRef> preached, taking for
							his text the whole first Psalm—[“]1. Blessed is the man that walketh not
							in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor
							sitteth in the seat of the scornful: 2. But his delight is in the Law of
							the Lord; and in his laws, doth he meditate day and night. 3. And he
							shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth
							his fruit in his season: his leaf also shall not wither: and whatsoever
							he doeth shall prosper. 4. The ungodly are not so: but are like the
							chaff which the wind driveth away 5. Therefore the ungodly shall not
							stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
							6. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
							ungodly shall perish.”— The preacher first observed the peculiar
							appropriateness of this Psalm as introductory to the whole collection—
							That it was commencing with a contrasted portraiture of the characters
							and destination of the righteous man and the Sinner. He said there were
							various opinions with regard to the author of this Psalm.— It might
							perhaps have been <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>; but it was more
							generally believed by the learned in biblical Literature to be the
							production of <persRef ref="ezra">Ezra</persRef>, the Priest, who formed
							the collection of the canonical books after the return from the
							Babylonian captivity— The style of the Book of Ezra, and that of this
							Psalm have it would seem to me no congeniality to indicate the same
							hand.— The Psalm is sublime poetry. The narrative of Ezra is rather
							beneath the elevation of historic prose.—but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Carer said that by whomsoever composed it was dictated by
							divine inspiration— The beauties of the imagery, the tree by the
							riverside, and the chaff driven before the wind <unclear>form</unclear> beautiful
							pictures of the Oriental pencil— And the Sermon closed with a warm
							exhortation to the auditory so to order their ways as to be like the
							trees by the side of the rivers— <persRef

							to the Department of State and enquired of <persRef
								ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Derrick</persRef> for several notes of remonstance of the former
							French Minister <persRef ref="pontois-edouard">Pontois</persRef>. He
							gave me to read three of his Letters to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> in 1837.38.39. and of Forsyth’s
							answers to them— With the last of which there was a list of all the Laws
							in the Slave-holding States, proscriptive of free coloured mariners— I
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Derrick for a copy of this List
							which he promised to have made out and to give me to-morrow— Returned to
							the chronology of <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Anthony
								Butler’s</persRef> negotiation for Texas—my progress exceedingly
							slow.— I took no morning walk, but sallied out just before the Evening
							twilight Walk with extreme pain, and feet excessively sore— <persRef

						<p>The pressure upon my brain to conclude the address to my Constituents,
							before I depart to return home continues with increasing gravity; and
							the day is now at hand when I must depart <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>from</hi> the performance of a different and yet more arduous task.
							I have concluded to go home next Tuesday, and wrote accordingly to
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard
								Rush</persRef> who has insisted on a visit from me at Sydenham on my
							way home— I wrote also to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

								Gray Loring</persRef> about stock in the United States Hotel
							company, and notifying him that he may expect me at Boston next
							Wednesday or Thursday. <persRef ref="heap-samuel">D<hi

							him nothing but some cold vague indefinite promise to remember him from
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— He was specially desirous of being re instated in
							his office of Surgeon in the Navy, and solicitous for my opinion whether
							he might hope to obtain it— The chance is a caprice of <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Captain Tyler</persRef>, who I suspect has a grudge
							against Heap for having been too much delighted with the <persRef
								ref="bey-ahmed">Bey’s</persRef> abolition of Slavery M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Heap said he must go in two or three days
							to embark for Constantinople to fetch his family home— At the Department
							of State, <persRef ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Derrick</persRef> gave me the list of unconstitutional State Laws
							against free coloured Seamen— I copied <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson’s</persRef> endorsement upon <persRef ref="butler-anthony"
								>Anthony Butlers</persRef> project of purchasing Texas, with a bribe
							of half a million of dollars to the <persRef ref="hernandez-ignacio"
								>Confessor</persRef> of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio"
								>Santa-Anna’s</persRef> sister— Jackson seems to have seen that this
							might be a bait thrown out by Santa Anna himself to get into his hands
							to impute offers of corruption by Jackson— There is colour for this
							suspicion from the fact that <persRef ref="hamilton-james3"
								>Hamilton</persRef> the Texian diplomatist did secretly as he
							thought make the same identical offer of half a million, to Santa-Anna
							himself who immediately published the Letter and divulged the fact— I
							find also in Butlers correspondence also that the Mexican Minister
								<persRef ref="tornel-jose">Tornel</persRef> after his return home
							from his mission here published a pamphlet in which he stated expressly
							that on his landing at New-York, the Agent of <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas
								Benton</persRef> came twice to him with numberless other
							speculators, to treat with him for Texian Lands.— In my walk this

							convalescent, but I fear is not. We had evening visits from <persRef

							Congress from Virginia to a young man named <persRef ref="hume-francis"
								>Francis Hume</persRef>, now a barkeeper at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> hotel, but who has some claim
							to a large Estate in England, by a supposed collateral consanguinity
							with <persRef ref="hume-david">David Hume</persRef> the historian, and
							descent from an Earl of Marchmont, in which Letter M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour advises the young man to consult
							me, and take my advice, and he requested leave to send M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hume to me this morning, to which I very
							cheerfully agreed— He came accordingly and asked my <hi
								rend="strikethrough">advice</hi>, but knew absolutely nothing about
							the nature or justice of his own claim— He said that a <persRef
								ref="morton-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremiah
								Morton</persRef> a lawyer of Virginia had been to England in pursuit
							of this claim in 1825, and had had made of it a suit in chancery, and
							that was all he knew about it, and he understood there were two
							difficulties in the way—one, evidence to establish the genealogy; and
							the other the Statute of Limitations— I asked him through whom the claim
							of consanguinity with David Hume, and through him with the earl of
							Marchmont was averred— He did not know— I asked him if he had a copy of
							the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, when left there by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton— He had not, but he presumed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Morton had— I advised him to procure the
							copy of those proceedings, and upon seeing them I might perhaps be
							enabled to advise him further— I overreached the space I had allotted to
							myself for the address to my Constituents, which absorbed the leisure of
							the morning— I then rode with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> to the Capitol after stopping
							at <persRef ref="keyworth-robert">Keyworth’s</persRef> and taking my
							repaired watchchain— At the Office of the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew"
								>Clerk</persRef> of the House, I enquired for many documents but
							found only the Message of 28. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last
							enclosing the correspondence of the Spanish Minister <persRef
								ref="deargaiz-pedro">Argaiz</persRef>, with the Secretary of State
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, relating to the
							case of the Schooner Amistad— It was referred to the Committee of
							foreign Affairs, but the papers were referred to the Committee of
							Foreign Affairs, sent immediately to the Printers and the Committee
							never saw them— The correspondence is a fire-brand, over which <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> casts a bucket of cold water by
							recommending to congress to refund the salvage claimed by <persRef
								ref="gedney-thomas">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								Gedney</persRef>: but Gedney’s claim supposes that the Schooner was
							Spanish property when taken by him— It was the property of the Mendi
							captors and ought to have been restored to them— When will the whole
							truth be told concerning this case?— If I dare to tell it—I shall be
							arrested before I have proceeded 3 steps on the way—perhaps charged with
							treason—perhaps expelled from the house— <persRef ref="child-david">M<hi

						<p>I finished at last the address to my constituents, and am so much
							dissatisfied with it, that I very much doubt whether I shall ever make
							any use of it— There is not more than one fourth part of the matter that
							should be included in it— There should be unity of purpose, symmetry of
							parts, concentration of argument, sharpness of conclusion, and impulse
							to action, in such a discourse. Of all this there is a lamentable
							deficiency in my address.— If I had time, perseverance and energy to
							write four such; and then methodize and abridge the four into one, it
							might be of some use. But I have neither time—nor strength—nor
							health—nor Spirits—nor manhood—to go through that process— I must now
							turn my thoughts and my remnant of my life to other objects— I am
							engaged to deliver a discourse to the historical Society of
							Massachusetts, on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next month,
							on the New England confederation of the 17<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> century—half bound to address the Society of Alumni of

							Historical Society of Pennsylvania, to deliver a Historical Discourse
							before that institution at any time during the present year that may be
							agreeable to me— In the decay of body and mind growing upon me with
							inexorable speed I lack Resolution to say No! to all these propositions,
							and to retire from the world of business to that of repose— <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							was here this morning and I had much conversation with him with respect
							to his management of my concerns of property in this City. I ought and
							intended to have settled them up to the present time since the close of
							this last Session of Congress—but it has been neglected— I requested of
							him however; and he promised me a statement of his accounts shewing his
							receipts and expenses on my account— He explained to me also the project
							for reorganizing Saint John’s Church, which led me to the determination
							to relinquish my pew in it. I called at the Office of the National
							Intelligencer and saw <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi

							concerning the address to the People of the Free States signed by me,

								<persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seaton</persRef> to publish, as he promised— Gales said he did not

								Charles</persRef> in the same chamber— Childs left the City this

								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Carer professe to be and I have no doubt
							is liberal in principle; and he lamented the divisions between the old
							and new schools of the Presbyterian church— I began my preparation for
							departure with the attempt to assort and endorse my files of Letters—at
							all times a heavy labour, but more and more aggravated every time I pass
							between this city and my home.— The work is always imperfectly done, and
							in assorting the files I find many Letters which ought long since to
							have been answered, which ought to be answered now, but which for want
							of time I could not answer when received, cannot answer now, and never
							shall find time to answer. A deep mortification—</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="mccarer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Carer</persRef> this morning at the second Presbyterian Church,
							from Hosea 6.1. [“]Come and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath
							torn and he will heal us: he hath smitten and he will bind us up.”— Upon
							this text the preacher gave a summary account of the Assyrian captivity
							which he considered as it is represented in the Scriptures, as a
							judgment of Heaven upon the sins of the People— And this is the
							remarkable characteristic of all the scriptural history of the old
							Testament— The creation of one pair of human beings from whom all
							mankind are descended is the foundation of the doctrine of human rights—
							The forfeiture of Paradise for disobedience to the will of God is a
							second moral principle teeming with a multitude of principles.— The
							Destruction of the whole human race by a flood with the exception of one
							family still exhibits the same feature— The vocation of <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>—the assignment of the land of Canaan
							to his descendants, and all their adventures in it from the crossing of
							the Jordan by <persRef ref="joshua">Joshua</persRef> to the Assyrian and
							Babylonian captivities, all the prosperous events are attributed to the
							favour of Jehovah propitiated by repentance for their sins, and
							obedience to his will, and all their calamities and disasters as
							punishment for their transgressions and breaches of their covenants with
							him— The Sin the most severely reproved, and yet that to which they were
							most addicted was idolatry— Jehovah is declared in the dialogue to be a
							jealous God visiting the iniquities the fathers upon the children to the
							third and fourth generation; and the most aggravated reproaches are cast
							upon those who bow the knee to <persRef ref="baal">Baal</persRef>, or
							pass their children through the fire to <persRef ref="moloch"
								>Moloch</persRef>— This exhortation of <persRef ref="hosea"
								>Hosea</persRef> to the Israelites was addressed to them in the time
							of the Assyrian captivity, and the tenor of the whole book is to call on
							the people to return to the God of their allegiance, with a promise of
							his favour in reward for their repentance. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Carer made the applica of instructions to his hearers with
							some allusion as it seemed to me with his yesterday’s conversation with
							me. He deplored the calamitous condition of the Church, but admonished
							his auditory that it is as owing to their own sins before God, and that
							if they would return to him he would return to them— After dinner
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read evening prayers for the second Sunday after
							Easter, and preached but I could not gather from what text— After church
							I visited <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas B. Johnson</persRef>, had half an hour’s
							conversation with him and took leave of him. Evening busy in preparing
							for departure—</p>
