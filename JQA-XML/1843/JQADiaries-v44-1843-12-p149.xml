                        <p>Snow and Rain all day— Confined to the house. In the intervals between
                            the Sessions of Congress frequent instances occur of applications to me
                            by individuals for my attention to business of theirs here when Congress
                            shall be next in Session.— I promise them my services as the occasions
                            may arise, but when Congress meet, some of these applications have
                            passed away from my Memory and unless reminded again of the business by
                            the applicants themselves, it is neglected. During the present recess of
                            Congress I have adopted the practice of noting in the margin of my Diary
                            these applications as they occur, and on a review of the manuscript, I
                            find them amount to eight; of which I made this day a minute for further
                            remembrance— Among them were the papers delivered to me on the 26<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last August by <persRef
                                ref="thaxter-norton">Quincy Thaxter</persRef> of Hingham to
                            authenticate <persRef ref="thaxter-jane">his wife’s</persRef> claim to a
                            part of the remnants of estate left by <persRef ref="otis-william3"
                                >William Otis</persRef>. These papers I now gave to <persRef
                                ref="johnson-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
                                Johnson</persRef> the Administrator of William Otis’s estate— They
                            are Affidavits in the Spanish language taken at the Havana testifying
                            that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thaxter is a daughter of <persRef
                                ref="otis-nathaniel">Nathaniel Otis</persRef> who lived and died at
                            the Havana, and was one of the brothers of William Otis— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson said the sum of about 75 dollars
                            might come to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thaxter from this claim—
                                <persRef ref="darby-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
                                Darby</persRef> brought me a copy of the newly printed 3<hi
                                rend="superscript">d.</hi> edition of his Universal Geographical
                            Dictionary for which I had subscribed and for which he made me pay him 5
                            dollars. He said he had read the account of my visit to the female
                            seminary at Washington Pennsylvania.— That it had been very interesting
                            to him, because he was born and raised in that part of Pennsylvania, and
                            was personally acquainted with <persRef ref="foster-sarah">Miss
                                Foster</persRef>, the principal teacher who addressed me.— The
                            redemption of my Diary arrears has left me, about two hours of daily
                            leisure till the meeting of Congress for arrears of correspondence— They
                            were employed this day in assorting and filing the Letters received
                            since my return home— Nine tenths of the Letters that I receive are not
                            worth answering.— and the remaining tenth would require more than all my
                            time to be answered as they deserve. Among the papers this day received
                            is a Cincinnati Catholic Telegraph—of 18. November 1843. <persRef
                                ref="purcell-edward">Rev. Edward Purcell</persRef> Editor.— It
                            contains a furious attack upon me, for asserting in my astronomical

                            was the founder of the Inquisition— The Rev. Edward Purcell, I suppose
                            is a Jesuit— <persRef ref="pascal-blaise">Blaise Pascal</persRef>
                            exposed the Ethics of the Jesuits in 16. The Rev. Edward Purcell shews

                        <p>My cough is still inflexible, and I was obliged by it to rise this
                            morning at four.— Yet was the day so shivered into splinters that time
                            failed me even to finish an answer to a friendly Letter of <persRef
                                ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef>, which I
                            received at Cincinnati— I had a morning visit from <persRef
                                ref="white-john6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
                                White</persRef> the Speaker of the House in the last Congress, with
                            Ex-Governor of Ohio <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef>, and
                                <persRef ref="harper-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Harper</persRef> also heretofore a member from Ohio. They understand
                            that of the members already arrived there is a number sufficient of
                            Kinderhoek democrats to elect a Speaker against any combined opposition—
                            They spoke of the preliminary question of the admission of members
                            elected by general ticket— There is no doubt that they will all be
                            admitted, in defiance of the Law but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            White expressed a doubt whether the ruling party would allow a
                            discussion of the question and supposed there might be some difficulty
                            in raising it— They intimated a wish that I would undertake to raise it,
                            which I told them I would do if it was desired, but that the state of my
                            health utterly disabled me from taking a leading part in the discussion
                            or management of the movement. I went to the Capitol, chiefly to call
                            upon <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Clark</persRef> for the Appraisers return of <persRef

                                Johnson’s</persRef> personal Estate— He told me that he had given it
                            to <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Force</persRef>, who had promised to return it the next morning— He
                            said he would see and speak to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Force
                            about it, this day. I afterwards called at M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Force’s office, but he was not there.— At the Capitol I
                            applied at the Clerk’s Office to have the Petitions and papers looked up
                            of which I had minutes from my Diary. I made out to obtain a copy of the
                            House Journal of the last Session of Congress.— I met at the House many
                            members. I was told there had been this morning a Kinderhook Caucus for
                            the choice of Speaker, at which the <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
                                >Calhoun</persRef> party, said to be 15. did not attend— The whig
                            Caucus was to be held at 4 this afternoon; and <persRef

                            of its result. Returning home, I met on the way and spoke to <persRef

                            came and informed me that the arrangements were all made for removing
                            next Monday Morning at 9 O’Clock the body of M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Thomas Baker Johnson, from the vault where it was
                            temporarily deposited, to the Rock Creek Church graveyard where it is to
                            be interred, by the side of <persRef ref="johnson-catherine">his

                            held, 32 or 33 members present; and a Committee appointed, to confer
                            with me, and report Monday Morning.</p>

                            Session of Congress, and the inauspicious composition of the house— The
                            question of the admission of the members from four States, elected by
                            general ticket, must arise at the first movement for the organization of
                            the house; but so overwhelming is the majority of the democracy in the
                            house, that the whigs are much perplexed to determine how to raise the
                            question. They expect it will be strangled by a tissue of forms.— The
                            Slavery questions are in my estimation than that of the admission of
                            general ticket members, and the aspect of the Slavery questions is
                            appalling. The most imminent of my dangers is the loss of my temper,
                            from which I fervently pray, I may be preserved.— This morning I went
                            with <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William C. Johnson</persRef> to the
                            Unitarian Church and heard <persRef ref="bulfinch-stephen">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> preach from Psalm
                            107.8 “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his
                            wonderful works to the children of men!” It was a thanksgiving discourse
                            introduced by a statement of the usage, in New-England, from the
                            earliest settlement of the Country to devote one day annually towards
                            the close of the year to festivity—to the gathering of the members of a
                            family together.— And the day is auspicated by religious worship and
                            thanksgiving to God for all his mercies. Last Thursday was the day of
                            this festival in Massachusetts and others of the New-England States, and
                            would have been the day for the delivery of this discourse if the
                            preacher had been there; and so far as the day is made an occasion of
                            gratitude to God it can never be out of season.— This afternoon I
                            attended at the second presbyterian church— I had supposed that the
                            administration of the communion would have formed a part of the morning
                            service, but it was the whole of that of the evening. Four young men and
                            one young married woman were admitted as members of the church. <persRef

                            it included belief of the Trinity and of the eternity of future

                        <p>I had sent last Evening, for <persRef ref="dyer-robert">M<hi

                            requesting him to call on me this morning, and he accordingly came, and
                            I directed him to make sale of the effects left by <persRef

                            I gave him the appraised inventory, and agreed upon next Monday as the
                            day of sale— Terms, cash for all Articles under a small amount and
                            endorsed notes at 30, 60, or 90 days for larger sums.— After taking <hi

                            sent me back the appraisement, and I returned it to the Orphan’s court,
                            where I was sworn to it by <persRef ref="roach-edward">M<hi

                            Before going to the house, I had two other morning visitors— First a
                            Scottish empirical <persRef ref="whitlaw-charles">Doctor
                                Whitlaw</persRef>, who had been here some twenty years ago with a
                            medicated vapour bath of which he claimed the invention, and which he
                            blazoned forth in the Preston Pans dialect as a panacea for all diseases
                            that afflict the human body.— I then witnessed the administration of his
                            bath, but did not try it.— He soon disappeared, and I had seen or heard
                            nothing more of him till this morning when he came and set his tongue in
                            motion like a mill clapper, till he saw some impatience of uneasiness in
                            my manner, when he left with me a pamphlet, and said he would come
                            again. His pamphlet is an account of a medicated vapour bath institution
                            founded by him in West London, whence he has recently returned to this
                            Country.— The other visitor was <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi

                            Reporter for that paper— I found the house in Session deep sunk in
                            debate on <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard’s</persRef> motion to
                            amend the journal by inserting the whig protest against the admission of
                            the general ticket members on that of Monday— The whimsical state of the
                            question now was that the protest was inserted on the Journal of
                            yesterday, and was read as part of that journal this morning—so that the
                            protest is in extenso upon the journal, while the house is debating
                            whether it shall be there or not— After three hours of this hopeful
                            debate <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved to
                            postpone it till tomorrow—which was carried.— The house proceeded to

                            himself. The memorial is long, and I thought before presenting it, my
                            duty was to possess myself fully of its contents— I accordingly read it
                            attentively— I had also been requested to announce to the house the

                            annunciation is to be made. I found the house again in Session, and as I
                            entered, <persRef ref="newton-willoughby">Willoughby Newton</persRef> a
                            member from Virginia was presenting the memorial of <persRef

                            as I was stating its contents Jones slunk out of the chair, and <persRef

                            crept into it— I moved that the memorial should be printed, and referred
                            to the Committee of Elections, when that committee shall be appointed;
                            which was adopted without opposition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            was carried, and Jones resumed the chair.— Then came a debate what
                            business should be taken up, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi

                            again, and again the house sustained Jones.— After much trifling

                        <p>The elections of yesterday and the day before sufficiently prove that
                            there is no schism in the democratic party, and not the shadow of a
                            party for the election of <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef>
                            as President of the United States— The house adjourned over to next
                            Monday to give the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> time to
                            make up his Committees— He asked to be relieved from the duty of
                            appointing the Committee of Elections, and put <persRef

                            of doors would be that the Committee was already packed, and it would
                            have been better to let the Speaker appoint the Committee himself.

                            that imputation was a conclusive reason for the house to choose the

                            after some debate was carried 98 to 48. It was growing late— I said I
                            would postpone to another day the communication I had to make to the

                            was adopted and the house adjourned over to Monday for the appointment
                            of the Committees.— This morning I went to the house where <persRef

                            not included in their appraisement, but had as is usual left to be
                            disposed of by the family— I found <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

                            inventory.— I went to the probate Court where the <persRef

                            dressed lady, who came and in an easy unconcerned manner told me she was
                            in great want of 50 cents to go North, and really did not know to whom
                            to apply for it— She gave a long and by no means clear account of how
                            much money she had had, and how it was all gone—till I asked her if she
                            was married?— yes! where was <persRef ref="u">her husband</persRef>?
                            here— What was his occupation?— why, if she must tell the whole story,
                            he was in prison—for what?— upon a prosecution about a sum of money, and
                            something alledged about false pretences—but the money was paid— I
                            thought she had earned her 50 cents, and unwilling to press her with
                            further enquiries gave her half a dollar with which she thankfully
                            departed— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Frye</persRef> came and rectified a mistake or two in the inventory

                            on the appraised inventory returned there— This I took for the
                            additional return of the Appraisers required by the <persRef

                            articles of cloathing and the like which they had left out of their
                            appraisement— I called at the Patriotic bank, and received in their
                            bills the last dividend of the Franklin Insurance Company— There I met
                                <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Force</persRef> and gave him the appraisement for the additional

                            the Articles before omitted at 150 dollars. They sent the appraisement
                            thus revised back to me, and I sent it by <persRef ref="benjamin2"

                        <p>My cough has so far subsided that my sleep is less disturbed, and after
                            waking this morning before four, without rising I slept again till past
                            six— A person by the name of <persRef ref="u">Ketcham</persRef> of the
                            Dutch reformed church, from the State of New-York, volunteered to
                            perform the service of public worship in the hall of the house of
                            Representatives this morning, and I went with <persRef

                                ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> to hear him— He gave out to

                            Jehovah’s awful throne; but he did not himself set the tune, and there
                            was no singing— He preached from Proverbs 3.17. [“]Her ways, are ways of
                            pleasantness; and all her paths are peace.” The Sermon was a sensible
                            discourse, well delivered, on the pleasantness of the ways of Wisdom,
                            and the Peace of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> her paths. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Ketcham’s selection of his text, and of
                            his Psalm to be sung was judicious, and impressive; but he could not set
                            the tune for singers to follow him, and his eulogy on Wisdom was hardly
                            commensurate with the pregnant beauty of the text— The character of his
                            mind is decent mediocrity.— The seats of the members were generally
                            filled, but there were less than 20 members of Congress present; among

                            He spoke of the recent re-election of <persRef ref="santaanna-antonio"
                                >General Santa-Anna</persRef> as President of the Mexican Republic,
                            and of the relations between Mexico and this Country. A subject upon
                            which I want Prudence and Fortitude to think, and still more to act—
                            After dinner I attended at the second Presbyterian Church, and heard
                                <persRef ref="knox-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Knox</persRef>, from 1. Corinthians 15.16. “The sting of death, is
                            Sin.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox’s Sermons are all
                            comminations— It is well for Christians to be often warned of their
                            responsibilities, their imperfections and their Sins.— But Sin is a term
                            of so indefinite a meaning, that to declaim against it is to brandish a
                            sword in the air— I spent this evening in preparing for the duties of
                            the coming week, and in meditating purposes never to be performed— On
                            full deliberation I conclude that the whole course of my conduct in this
                            Congress must be defensive, even of the cause of Liberty, and above all
                            things to endure mortification.</p>

                        <p>My Journal of yesterday was made up before breakfast; but household
                            concerns, marketing, grocery bills, and multitudes of Newspapers by the
                            Mail, distracted my attention, so that I barely began reading in the
                            National Intelligencer the annual report of the <persRef
                                ref="spencer-john">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on the
                            finances; when it was snatched by 3 or 4 successive calls, from my hands
                            and I saw the paper no more— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
                                >Antoine</persRef> came with a promissory note, dated 11. Nov<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1842. and signed by <persRef
                                ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Thomas B. Johnson</persRef> to pay in 12
                            months from that day 150 dollars.— I paid the money and took up the
                            note— Antoine gave me a somewhat discouraging account of the Affairs of
                            the Franklin Insurance Company, and spoke of a report by a Committee of
                            Stockholders made last September, which he afterwards brought and left
                            here, shewing that for the last seven years, the profits of Insurance of
                            the company have not amounted to more than an average of 100 dollars a
                            year— There is very bad, if not fraudulent management of the concern.—

                            John W. Jones, presented by me was laid on the table— I moved to amend
                            the journal by stating the fact, that my motion agreed to by the house
                            was that the memorial should be printed and referred to the Committee of
                            Elections when appointed.— Jones put <persRef ref="hopkins-george"

                        <p>In assorting my Letters last Evening which I did not complete, I found
                            ten cases of individual private interests, claiming or soliciting my aid
                            or service here— I made minutes of them for memory, and this morning
                            gave personal attention to a part of them— At the Department of State I
                            delivered to the present Secretary <persRef ref="upshur-abel"
                                >Upshur</persRef> a Letter to him from <persRef ref="leitch-john"
                                >John M. Leitch</persRef> a merchant in New-York, who had enclosed
                            it to me, requesting me to deliver it to the Secretary of State— It
                            contained an enquiry whether the United States would protect a
                            commercial adventure to the coast of Circossia? Upshur read the Letter,
                            and said in a sulky tone that a duplicate of the same Letter had been
                            received by him and answered that to such general enquiries no other
                            than a general answer could be given— What the general answer was, he
                            did not say— I went to the Pension Office, and left with the <persRef
                                ref="edwards-james">Commissioner Edwards</persRef> the Letter of
                                <persRef ref="clark-lw">L. W. Clark</persRef> of Bradford,
                            Massachusetts concerning a Pension claim of <persRef ref="u">his

                            1843. another pension claim.— My next call was at the War Office, where
                            I saw the <persRef ref="porter-james">Secretary Porter</persRef> and the
                            chief Clerk <persRef ref="parker-daniel">Gen<hi rend="superscript"

                            was gracious and complacent in his manner— I requested him to have the

                            Roxbury entered as an applicant for a cadet warrant at the West-Point
                            Academy; and left with him five recommendatory Letters in his favour. I
                            then went to the house, and as I entered heard <persRef

                            the journal of yesterday and pronouncing my name as first of the

                            amend the journal of yesterday by inserting the protest, and claimed
                            precedence for his motion— The <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Speaker</persRef> decided that Payne’s motion to be excused from
                            serving on a Committee was a privileged question, and had precedence by
                            his rising first— Payne was excused, and Barnard’s motion brought up
                                <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Hector Dromgoole</persRef>, and a

                                >General Almonte</persRef> was to ask his good offices to obtain the
                            release of <persRef ref="canfield-israel">Israel Canfield</persRef> one
                            of the Texian prisoners in Mexico, in whose behalf I had received a

                            of New Jersey. The General took down the name, and promised his good
                            Offices. He said he had obtained the release of a <persRef

                                Crittenden</persRef> the Senator from Kentucky— This morning

                                Telfair</persRef> came with another budget of ragged papers, and a
                            racket of eloquence about her claim but without a clear idea of it
                            herself, and without the possibility of giving a clear idea of it to me.
                            I asked her to prepare her petition and bring it to me and promised to
                            present it— She said she would. That must at least contain some
                            intelligible statement.— At the house after the reading the journal, I
                            asked to be excused from serving on the Committee of Manufactures; the
                            state of my health making it impossible for me to discharge the arduous
                            duties of that office as they ought to be performed— I said I had other
                            reasons, with which it was not necessary for me to trouble the house—

                        <p>My distemper has taken a different turn, and I am suffering with opposite
                            symptoms to those which followed me through my journey and since my
                            return. They disable me more for labour, and depress more deeply my

                                Heiskell</persRef> was here this morning, and took back the three

                                    >D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Lovell</persRef>— I had

                            vessels, since they sailed— The Secretary of the Navy <persRef

                            of the War Department had been— He had said that if there was any thing
                            at any time in the Department which I wished to be done; if I would drop
                            him a line it should be immediately attended to— Such is the way of the

                            reputation and destroy my character than David Henshaw. Of the two, I
                            prefer the growling sulkiess of Upshur— I called at the Patriotic Book;
                            deposited there a check for 240 dollars, received as the Executor of

                            present stage of my complaint— At the house immediately after the
                            reading of the Journal, <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
                                >Dromgoole</persRef> called up the question about the rules— There
                            was <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garret Davis’s</persRef> motion for the
                            reference of the general ticket elections to the Committee, and <persRef

                            consent of the movers both these were postponed— Dromgoole’s motion for
                            a new rule to exclude from the Journals all papers, not received by the
                            house, first came up, and <persRef ref="collamer-jacob"
                                >Collamer</persRef> of Vermont made a short sensible speech against
                            it— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved the
                            previous question which the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>

                            Dromgoole wanted to have his new rule first adopted and intreated Cave
                            to suspend his motion for that purpose; but Cave was inflexible— The
                            previous question was carried, and the rules with the exception of the
                            two struck out on <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> motion with

                            Dromgoole then moved his rule for excluding from the journal any paper
                            which the house refuses to receive, and it was carried without even
                            taking the yeas and nays— Sundry other Resolutions were offered, but
                                <persRef ref="stiles-william">William H. Stiles</persRef> of Georgia
                            arrested them by announcing the death of <persRef ref="millen-john"

                        <p>I expended all the leisure of this morning in copying a list of the yeas
                            and nays on my motion to except the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> or
                            anti-petition rule, from the adoption by the house of the rules of the
                            last Congress— Two hundred members of the present house have taken their
                            seats— The vote of the whigs has never exceeded 65. that of the
                            democracy has not passed 130.— The democratic majority may be set down,
                            as averaging just two thirds— Yet on my motion the vote stood 91 to 94 a
                            majority of only 3 to retain the rule— 27 members from New-York voted
                            for my motion—only 5 against it— 12 from Pennsylvania for and 8 against
                            it. Ohio 13 for and 5 against it— This morning, immediately after the
                            reading of the journal the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef>
                            said the first business in order was the call of the States for
                            Petitions— This caused surprize the practice of presenting petitions
                            openly in the house having been superseded in the last Congress, by that
                            of presenting them silently at the clerks table, and having them
                            referred to the appropriate Committees— The Speaker was now reminded of
                            this practice, which he explicitly recognised, but called out Petitions
                            are in order from the State of Maine.— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> first urged to
                            proceed immediately to the election of a chaplain, and cavilling
                            objections being made, moved a suspension of the rules, which was
                            carried by a vote of two thirds.<space/>had moved a resolution that the
                            house would dispense with the election of a chaplain for the present
                            Session; but this proposition was immediately scouted down.— At the
                            first viva voce vote for chaplain, there was no choice; at the
                                second<space/><persRef ref="tinsley-isaac">Tinsley</persRef> was
                            chosen— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef>, chairman of the
                            Committee of Ways and Means moved the reference of the annual report of

                            the finances, in parcels to four separate Committees. I objected to this
                            and insisted that the whole Report should be referred to the Committee
                            of Ways and Means, which after a short and spirited debate was done—
                            Then the Speaker called again for petitions, for which no one seemed
                            prepared— The States of Maine and New Hampshire were quickly despatched—
                            Massachusetts was called— <persRef ref="parmenter-william"
                                >Parmenter</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-daniel">D. P.

                            ordered to be referred and printed— The Speaker hurried on and called
                            Rhode Island and Connecticut till <persRef ref="winthrop-robert"
                                >Winthrop</persRef> called him back— I then rose and presented a

                        <p>The explosion which took place in the house, on my presenting yesterday
                            the anti-slavery petition of 585 citizens of Western New-York is a
                            premonitory symptom of the desperation with which the Slave power will
                            be exercised in the present Congress— The <persRef ref="latimer-george"
                                >Latimer</persRef> petition signed by upwards of 50000 names was
                            received at the last Session of Congress, and referred to the judiciary
                            Committee— The Petition from New-York which I presented yesterday
                            contains the same prayer in the same identical words— The <persRef
                                ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> instantly decided—that it was
                            excluded from reception by the gag-rule now the 23<hi rend="superscript"
                                >d.</hi> I remonstrated, that on the Journals of the last Session,
                            it was recorded that petitions in the same words were received and
                            referred to the judiciary Committee. Half a dozen Slave breeders were
                            already on their feet— The Speaker coolly said—[“]does the gentleman
                            appeal from the decision of the chair?” I said I had already too much
                            experience not to be aware of the fate of any appeal from the decision
                            of the chair—but that I intreated the Speaker to revise his own decision
                            so far as to look at the precedent on the Journal of the last Session.
                            The Speaker said he considered the petition excluded by the rule.— I
                            then said that if the Speaker refused to look at the precedent, I had no
                            other alternative, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> take an appeal from
                            his decision— At this instant, <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W.
                                Gilmer</persRef> started up in a panic and moved to adjourn, which
                            after a short respite to receive communications from the Executive
                            departments was carried without opposition; the Speaker saying in the
                            most courteous tone that he would very cheerfully examine the
                            precedents. This morning I went with my granddaughter <persRef
                                ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> to the Hall of the House of
                            Representatives, and heard <persRef ref="barker-rachel">M<hi

                                >th</hi> chapter of <persRef ref="daniel">Daniel</persRef>.— She has
                            the gift of fluency, without an instant of hesitation—very distinct
                            articulation, without cant or sing song—but very little power of
                            reasoning and not much imagination— That she could retain so long an
                            attentive auditory without being absolutely tedious argues no ordinary
                            talent; but she flies from subject to subject, and has a cento of
                            scriptural quotations by heart which supplies her copiously with words—

                            After dinner at the Presbyterian Church I heard <persRef

                            purposes had thought of settling at Boston. He had at my invitation
                            accompanied me on my recent Western tour, and I had invited him to spend
                            the winter with us here— But on making enquiries of <persRef

                            concluded to depart immediately; went last night to <persRef

                            came this morning with her husband <persRef ref="barker-caleb"

                            from Western New-York, and paid me a visit— She gave me a full dose of
                            the effusion of the Spirit, and is perfectly happy in the conviction of
                            her own spiritual perfection.— But for the rigidity of muscle which
                            belongs to the quaker variety of the human species, Rachel would be
                            handsome— Her eye is full of intelligence and conscious power. I asked
                            her at what age she first felt the spur of her vocation to preach the
                            gospel?— She said before she was ten years old, but that she began to
                            preach between 16 and 17. and when she first began was as fully
                            qualified for the work then as she is now, or ever shall be. At the

                            made the prayer, short of 3 minutes— After the reading of the Journal
                            the <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> said the first business
                            in order was <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garret Davis’s</persRef>
                            resolution to refer the general ticket election question to the

                            petitions was superseded? He said that G. Davis’s resolution was a
                            privileged question and thereby took precedence.— <persRef

                        <p>The Committee for the revisal of the Rules was raised on the motion of
                                <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> by a stale device to worm
                            through the gag rule at the commencement of a Congress, when the new
                            members are most prone to renounce the rule, by giving them a pretext
                            for retaining it for a time— This scheme was tried at the first Session
                            of the last Congress, with entire success— The Committee was announced
                            yesterday morning— Henry A. Wise, John Q. Adams, <persRef

                            in the course of the day Wise sent round to the members of the committee
                                s<unclear>. . .</unclear> notification to meet in the chamber of
                            committee of Commerce last and every evening. Seven of us met
                            accordingly. I found them assembled Ingersoll and Dromgoole absent— We
                            had some general conversation about the rules and then agreed to take
                            them up and discuss them seriatim—we went through 8 of them proposing
                            petty amendments as we proceeded and then adjourned. Wise had a copy of
                            the rules, with manuscript proposals of amendment by <persRef

                                <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb">Clerks’</persRef> Office; but we found
                            very little substance in them— This Morning <persRef

                            was here, and I paid him three bills of charges for the expenses of

                            6. cents. Enormous extortion, for which there was no remedy.— At the
                            House Wise moved a suspension of the rules to go into Committee of the
                            whole on the State of the Union, to dole out in driblets the <persRef
                                ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message to the standing
                            Committees—and it was carried— <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Jones</persRef> gave the chair of the Committee of the whole on the

                            Virginia, and Wise parceled out the Message to 13 or 14 Committees. He
                            came at last to some dark no meaning words about Western rivers and
                            waters, and moved their reference to the Committee of Ways and Means—
                            And now the West blazed out in a cross fire of debate for three hours
                            when <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> of Ohio moved the
                            committee to rise, and the house adjourned— Evening Meeting at <persRef

                        <p>At ten this morning I was at the chamber of committee of Commerce at the
                            house, to which time and place the Committee for the revisal of the
                            revisal of the rules was adjourned. successively the <persRef
                                ref="beardsley-samuel;white-john6;ingersoll-charles;davis-john8;vinton-samuel;chapman-reuben"
                                >other members of the committee</persRef> came in, except <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> the Chairman, and <persRef
                                ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> who since Saturday night
                            has been invisible.— By a quarter past ten there was a quorum of the
                            Committee; but they waited three quarters of an hour for the appearance
                            of the chairman.— I then observed that being the second person named on
                            the Committee, by the rules of the house, the absence of the chairman,
                            the duties of that office devolved upon me.— I proposed therefore to
                            resume the revisal of the rules, in their order— The revisal had been
                            made at the former meeting to the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                            inclusive—the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 10<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> were now passed without alteration, when
                            after eleven Wise made his appearance— Beardsley reminded him of the
                            hour—he said he had mistaken it— That <persRef ref="espy-james">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy</persRef> had been holding him by
                            the button, till he grazed upon the time of meeting of the Committee,
                            and he must take care that it should not happen again.— We then resumed
                            the discussion of the rules and after some phizzing of steam at the
                                16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule which gives the power to the
                                <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> or chairman of the
                            Committee of the whole to clear the galleries an cases of disorder, we
                            travelled through to the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 19<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> rules, concerning the admission of
                            Stenographers into the house— There was in the Committee a general
                            outbreak against this corps of reporters, and sundry restrictive
                            amendments to the rules relating to them were proposed. I told the
                            Committee that it was a hornet’s nest, which it might be prudent not to
                            disturb—whereupon the Committee adjourned till to-morrow at ten. In the
                            house, the Public Lands, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, <persRef

                            the usual usurpers on the business of the day— The question of reception
                            upon <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard’s</persRef> motion to amend
                            the journal, was at last on the motion of <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis"

                            directing the Committee of Elections to report on the validity of the

                            adopted by yeas and nays 148 to 32— Petitions— The Speaker reversed his
                            decision of Saturday, and declared the Petition of <persRef

                            New-York State, not excluded by the rule—but the question of reception
                            was made and laid on the table 97 to 80. and the new vital struggle for
                            the right of petition commenced in the midst of which the house
                            adjourned— In the evening I went with <persRef ref="hellen-mary"

                            immediately after he expired, to inform Carroll of the fact— Judge
                            Thompson was one of my colleagues as Secretary of the Navy in the

                            their account— May I be also ready! This morning, I attended again the
                            Committee for the revisal of the rules first in the room of the
                            Committee of Commerce. But as that Committee met at 11. we passed into
                            the adjoining room of the Committee on Post Offices and Post roads.— The
                            Chairman <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> was again tardy a full
                            hour—and <persRef ref="davis-john8">Davis</persRef> of Indiana, engaged
                            upon another Committee, came in still later. <persRef
                                ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> did not show his Cognac
                            face—though he did afterwards in the house, but without taking any part
                            in the debate— The Committee resumed the revisal of the rules and after
                            discussing, adopting or rejecting various proposed amendments, came to
                            the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 25<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> concerning the presentation, and reception of Petitions.
                            Here was the stumbling block. I moved to strike out the last clause of
                            the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the whole of the 25<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule. It was noon, and the Committee
                            adjourned till 10. to morrow Morning.— In the house, the life and death
                            struggle for the right of Petition was resumed— The question of
                            reception of the petition from Illinois was laid on the table 98 to 80.
                            After a long and memorable debate— I then presented the Resolves of the
                            Massachusetts Legislature of<space/>March 1843 proposing an Amendment to
                            the Constitution of the United States, making the Representation of the
                            People in the house proportioned to the numbers of free persons—and
                            moved it should be read, printed and referred to a select Committee of
                            9. and now sprung up the most memorable debate ever entertained in the
                            house; in the midst of which the house at half past 3 adjourned.— I can
                            give no account of it— Wise formally surrendered at discretion his
                            citadel rule, to the right of petition— Then came a cross fire between
                                <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>, <persRef

                            taken the floor— The crisis now requires of me coolness, firmness,
                            Prudence, Moderation, and Fortitude beyond all former example— I came
                            home in such a state of agitation that I could do nothing but pace my
                            chamber.</p>

                        <p>Meeting of the Committee on the revisal of the rules. <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> the Chairman came in reasonable
                            time; but <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> was very late. I
                            had moved to strike out the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule; and
                            that part of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which at my motion
                            was adopted on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1842. as a
                            necessary substitute, to obtain the reception of petitions at all— I
                            insisted upon the question’s being put on striking them both out
                            together, which after some discussion was agreed to—the question was
                            taken by yeas and nays— Ayes <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
                                >Beardsley</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-john8">John W.
                                Davis</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-john6">John White</persRef> and
                            Adams— Nays Wise, <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef>, and
                                <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, who as
                            soon as the vote was decided declared he was glad it had passed— It
                            suited him exactly— Such is the double nature of the man. Wise had
                            prepared a substitute ten times worse than the rule to be rescinded— The
                            same that was palmed upon the Committee to revise the rules at the first
                            Session of the last Congress.— That on the presentation of any petition,
                            memorial or paper relating in any manner to Slavery, the question of
                            consideration shall always be considered as raised, and they shall be
                            laid on the table.— Wise now declined to offer it. But Chapman did—and
                            the vote upon it was Ayes Chapman, Ingersoll, Wise, nays Adams,
                            Beardsley, Davis, Vinton and White— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
                                >Dromgoole</persRef> would have voted against rescinding the
                            existing rule, and for the substitute; but he was not present, and has
                            not attended any Meeting of the Committee. After this decision, the
                            Committee discussed two or three more rules, and adjourned to Tuesday
                            Morning at ten. Wise as Chairman put into my hands <persRef
                                ref="french-benjamin">French’s</persRef> paper book, and the minutes
                            of the proceedings of the Committee hitherto—said he was going to
                            Virginia and should be absent 8 or 10 days In the House— The Journal
                            made up under the direction of the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Speaker</persRef> stated that I was called to order for offensive
                            words— I moved to amend the journal by stating that I was called to
                            order by <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Saunders</persRef> of
                            North-Carolina for <hi rend="italic">irrelevancy</hi>, sustained by the
                            Speaker—this pretence of irrelevancy being a mere subterfuge to suppress
                            the freedom of Speech— It was under this offensive act of the Speaker,
                            that I used the words at which he chose to take offense, and to order me
                            to take my seat— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> urged me to move
                            to strike out the statement that I was called to order for offensive
                            words; but with this house, I knew I should fail on that motion, and as
                            I did use offensive words, although they were not taken down, or even
                            assigned by the Speaker as his reason for ordering me to take my seat,
                            and the Speaker had no right to enter upon the journal, that he had
                            called me to order for offensive words, I was willing to leave that
                            entry as it was, adding the previous entry that the Speaker had already
                            sustained a slave-tainted call of me to order, for irrelevancy— He
                            agreed that my amendment should be entered in the Journal. <pb n="171"
                                type="ms"/>The occurrences in the house yesterday and this day have
                            been so extraordinary that they would require a narrative which it is
                            impossible for me to write out, but a brief summary of which I must
                            borrow a supernumerary page to record.— Yesterday after the long
                            snarling debate to suppress the enthusiastical petition from the State
                            of Illinois, finally read, and upon question of its reception laid on
                            the table, when I presented the Resolves of the Legislature of
                            Massachusetts, and moved the reference of them to a select Committee of
                            9. <persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> moved the Committee on
                            the judiciary,<space/>a Committee of one member from each State, Wise
                            rose, called upon the Reporters to take note of what he was about to
                            say, asked the particular attention of the house, and declared once for
                            all, and forever that he renounced this <hi rend="small-caps">War</hi>
                            against Southern rights which had been several years waged in the hall—
                            He would vote for my motion to refer these Resolves to a select
                            Committee, and hoped I should be the chairman of it that the whole
                            Committee should be of the same complexion; and that the whole mass of
                            abolition petitions should be referred to the same Committee, that we
                            might make a report in our own way, and the house and the country might
                            see what we were after— Whereupon <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
                                >Holmes</persRef>, Beardsley, <persRef ref="weller-john"
                                >Weller</persRef> and <persRef ref="french-richard"
                            >French</persRef>, made frothy and foaming speeches about abolition,
                                <persRef ref="davis-richard">R. D. Davis</persRef> rose to take the
                            floor, and I said I hoped I should be indulged with an opportunity to
                            say a few words, when the house adjourned— This day, when the Speaker
                            announced the call for petitions, as the order of the day—R. D. Davis
                            rose again to take the floor, but <persRef ref="king-preston">Preston
                                King</persRef> one of the five members from New-York, who clings to
                            the gag-rule made a feeble attempt to deprive me of the floor to reply
                            to the slave mongers licensed all day yesterday— He charged me with
                            arresting the progress of the presentation of petitions— I said I would
                            not move a suspension of the rules to obtain permission to address the
                            house, but only demanded a decision upon my motion to refer the Resolves
                            of the Legislature of Massachusetts to a select Committee— <persRef
                                ref="hudson-charles">Hudson</persRef> moved to suspend the rules to
                            enable me to address the house and <persRef ref="hunt-washington"
                                >Hunt</persRef> of New-York called the yeas and nays on the motion—
                            The vote was 123 to 46. and I spoke about an hour in reply to Wise,
                            Holmes, Weller and French— Desultory, weak, and superficial—but
                            effective— <persRef ref="belser-james">Belser</persRef> moved to lay the
                            Resolves of Massachusetts on the table— Lost 64 to 104. <persRef

                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. P. Upshur</persRef>, to

                            morning— I attended accordingly— The meeting numbered about 40 persons
                            It was to transact the business for which the evening supper party had
                            been gathered at <persRef ref="abert-john">Col<hi rend="superscript"

                                >Navy</persRef> were now present— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Upshur proposed me, as chairman of the meeting, and <persRef

                            which was unanimously agreed to.— Then sundry Resolutions were proposed
                            and adopted among which was one that a Committee of 5 should be
                            appointed by the Chairman, to draw up a memorial to asking for the
                            national Institute patronage and pecuniary assistance. All this had been
                            prepared beforehand by <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi

                            be in my power— It certainly would not during the present Session of
                            Congress— They altered the words, to read on some future day of which
                            due notice will be given— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.

                        <p>I told <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Beardsley</persRef> yesterday morning that I had thoughts of
                            proposing to the Committee on the revisal of the rules to report in part
                            immediately, to strike out from the rules, the gag and its counterpart
                            for the reception of petitions—that is the 25<hi rend="superscript"

                                >th.</hi> rule. He asked if I thought that would be the best way to
                            get rid of the rule I said I did. He said he was decided for getting rid
                            of the rule— I asked <persRef ref="markoe-francis2">M<hi

                            said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upshur had answered “not to his

                            for the Session. And I directed the reference to the judiciary Committee
                            of all the petitions, referred to that Committee on the 23<hi

                            The Music of the Opera of <persRef ref="norma">Norma</persRef>, which

                            otherwise called judge Colquitt or lawyer Colquitt, or the honourable
                            Walter T. Colquitt, Senator of the United States from Georgia— His text
                            was 2. Corinthians 6.1. “We then as workers, together with <hi

                            grace of God in vain—” He had read the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            chapter and stretched over it the commentary upon his text. He is the
                            most thorough Jack at all trades, in the public service, and much better
                            suited for an Ambassador for Christ as a Methodist preacher, than for a
                            member of either House of Congress. His action in the pulpit is too
                            excessive for his sincerity; there is a convulsive motion in the muscles
                            of his face, and his voice often sinks from a strong base organ into
                            ventriloquism— I have received a Letter from a woman a stranger to me
                            but who says she knows him well, and warns me to beware of him.— The
                            house was crowded, and his sermon was eloquent After dinner I attended
                            at the Presbyterian Church, where a <persRef ref="u">Doctor

                            Romans 1.16. “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
                            the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth; to the Jew
                            first and also to the Greek” On returning home I found here <persRef

                            morality is so dissolute, and his nature so treacherous, that my regard
                            for him as a once valued friend has more than once exploded— His double
                            dealing now is from a maggot in his brain, worming him into the belief
                            that as a representative of the Keystone State, with his transcendent
                            talents he is the man to hold the balance between the Northern and
                            Southern Sections of the Union, and that in the exercise of that
                            umpirage he is to cast his dead-weight always on the side of the South
                            as the weaker party— He has now prevailed upon nineteen of his
                            colleagues of the Pennsylvania to join him in a written recommendation

                        <p>I received the evening before last a Letter from <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, asking for an authenticated
                            copy of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> Will, to be forwarded as
                            speedily as possible— Yesterday was Christmas— Probate Office closed.
                            This morning after calling at the National Intelligencer Office, and
                            leaving with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            at this Session, to be published in the paper I stop’d at the Register’s
                            Office of the Orphan’s Court, and asked of <persRef ref="roach-edward"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roach</persRef> an authenticated
                            copy of the Will, which he promised, but said would require for full

                                >Secretary of State</persRef> that he is the Register— He sent me
                            the copy of the Will this afternoon— I received it, while at dinner; but
                            must wait till to-morrow to obtain the certificate at the Department of
                            State— I attended at the Room of the Committee of Commerce, the

                            commenced. They call it a <hi rend="italic">breeze</hi>.— I proposed to
                            the Committee, to report forthwith in part—that is to rescind the 25<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the last clause of the 24<hi

                            Committee were averse to the proposal, and I did not press it— The
                            Committee proceeded to review the rules in their order—made sundry
                            alterations none of which appeared to me to be amendments, and wasted
                            time in debating and rejecting other critical substitutions of
                            synonimous words— Adjourned till to-morrow morning at ten— In the house
                            there were attempts by several members to divert the order of bu- which
                            not being duly repressed by the <persRef ref="jones-john9"
                                >Speaker</persRef>, consumed a considerable portion of the day— I
                            enquired of the business left unfinished in Committee of the whole, on
                            the state of the Union last week, that is the parceling out of the
                                <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message to the
                            Committees was not the first in order— The speaker said it was not— At
                            last the Speaker called for Petitions— I presented one from Connecticut,
                            containing 4 prayers the first of which was for the abolition of Slavery
                            and the Slave-trade in the District of Columbia—the other 3 prayers were
                            not within the rule, and I moved the reference of the forth—intercouse
                            with Hayti, to the Committee of Foreign Affairs.— The Speaker decided
                            that the whole Petition was excluded— This was contrary to the
                            Precedents— I appealed from the decision, but it was sustained by the
                            house 105 to 40—</p>

                        <p>Soon after 9 O’Clock this morning, I called at the Department of State,

                            the house— At 10. I met the Committee on the revisal of the rules in the
                            room of the Committee of Commerce— We made some progress in the
                            operation; but every member has whims of his own to alter and amend and
                            in the way of mutual concession the members of the Committee have so
                            much deference for each other, that they adopt without discussion one
                            another’s humours, and instead of simplifying complicate the rules and
                            make debate for the house.— This morning, <persRef

                                <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>— The States and
                            Territories were called through for petitions, in the course of half an
                            hour— I had but one to present— Then came the call for Reports of
                            Committees; and then for Resolutions. The first was that of Edmund Burke
                            of New-Hampshire that the house will proceed on Thursday the 4<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January to elect a Postmaster— The
                                <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhounites</persRef> had hitherto
                            staved off this motion till now— They dared no longer to resist it—
                            Burke moved the Resolution the previous question and the yeas and nays
                            all at once— A motion to lay the resolution on the table was lost 73 to
                            84. The previous question was carried and the resolution itself 83. to
                            69. The quid pro quo for New-Hampshire sycophancy to the South is
                            patronage, and Burke fairly dragooned them out of their bowels of
                            compassion for <persRef ref="mccormick-william">M’Cormick</persRef>, the
                            present Postmaster— He must go.— <persRef ref="hale-john"
                            >Hale</persRef>, another member from New-Hampshire, startled at an
                            estimate of nine millions of dollars for the Navy, moved yesterday a
                            retrenchment Resolution of enquiry about the home squadron.— Charles J.
                            Ingersoll made this day <hi rend="strikethrough">made</hi> one of his
                            snaky, rabid retrenchment speeches, against Hale’s motion, under colour

                            moved the previous question— I said I should be glad to say a few words.
                            He offered to withdraw if I would renew the motion. I declined— The
                            house refused to sustain the previous question— I replied to Ingersoll—

                                Baldwin</persRef> last evening was for the purpose of convincing me
                            of the absolute necessity of remounting the second regiment of dragoons—
                            In the reduction of the army which I urged with so much zeal and effect
                            at the second Session of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress
                            my purpose was to disband that regiment entirely, and it was carried by
                            a large majority in the house— The Senate could only be brought to turn
                            it into a rifle regiment, disbanding only the horses. There was an
                            agonizing struggle the whole of the last Session; to repeal that part of
                            the act of 23. August 1842. It failed and the horses were sold. And now
                            the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> recommends to remount
                            the regiment, and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Twiggs, and M<hi

                            Standard, sent me an extra number of the paper containing my speech of
                            last Friday as reported in the National Intelligencer of Saturday—with a
                            note stating that he had a subscription to print a large edition of the
                            Speech, and requesting me to revise the copy sent me; which I did last
                            Evening; and I left it this morning at the Standard Office. M<hi

                            travelled through all the remainder of the existing rules, altering,
                            amending, striking out, and adding.— They then adjourned to Saturday
                            morning ten O’Clock when a fair copy of the code as amended by the
                            Committee, is to be presented, for their final action and vote upon it—
                            And with the exception of the striking out of the anti-petition rule,
                            all the remainder of the report is not worth a wisp of straw.— Nay it is
                            worse than nothing, and the existing rules form a less objectionable
                            system than the adopted report— In the house numerous notices were given
                            by different members of their intention to bring in Bills— A new
                            practice, of which I believe—I myself set the first example.— <persRef

                            jail here, and advertised to be sold for jail fees.— Giddings moved its

                            and papers— Another explosion and the subject laid over because it gave
                            rise to debate.—</p>

                        <p>The record of yesterday must overflow upon this day— When Giddings
                            presented the petition from the Negro <persRef ref="jones-william9"
                                >William Jones</persRef> now in Jail and advertised to be sold for
                            Jail fees, the whole slave representation was up in arms—55 names are
                            recorded in favour of a motion to lay the petition on the table— The
                                <persRef ref="jones-john9">Speaker</persRef> ordered the whole
                            subject to lie over because it raised debate. It was followed by a

                            chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, from that
                            Committee, for an Instruction to them to report a Bill for abolishing
                            imprisonment for debt in the District of Columbia, which was carried—and

                            the home squadron came up, and was debated till <persRef

                            which a quorum could not be obtained to vote and the house adjourned— I
                            had notified all the members of the select Committee on the Resolves of
                            the Massachusetts Legislature, to meet this morning at ten in the room
                            of the Committee of Commerce— When I notified <persRef
                                ref="rhett-robert">R. B. Rhett</persRef>, he answered that he
                            received the notice, but immediately after the Speaker announced and
                            read a Letter from Rhett to him asking to be excused from serving on
                            that Committee— The house without opposition excused him I was riding to
                            the Capitol this morning to attend the Committee, when I met <persRef
                                ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Grinnell</persRef> walking to my house— I had promised him yesterday
                            to go with him this morning to the pension office, and the engagement
                            had slipped from my Memory. He now came in to my carriage came with me
                            to the Capitol, and while I was attending the committee went with my
                            granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, who had
                            been in the carriage with me, to his lodgings— The meeting of the
                            Committee lasted upwards of an hour. Present Adams <persRef

                            not been announced, it was agreed that nothing decisive should be done
                            at this meeting, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer offered a
                            Resolution that the Amendment of the Constitution proposed by the
                            Legislature of Massachusetts ought not to be recommended— A desultory
                            conversation was held in which Gilmer and Ingersoll gave their opinions
                            against the proposed amendment<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> and M<hi

                            was necessary to authenticate a claim of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                        <p>On returning yesterday from the pension Office to the Capitol, with

                                Grinnell</persRef>, I found the house in Session, and just entering
                            upon the discussion of the question what to do with the petition of
                                <persRef ref="jones-william9">William Jones</persRef>, the negro
                            claiming to be a free citizen of Virginia, but now in jail here, and
                            advertised to be sold for jail fees— <persRef ref="saunders-romulus"
                                >Saunders</persRef> of North Carolina was arguing against any action
                            of the house upon the petition.— So did <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
                                >John Campbell</persRef>, <persRef ref="haralson-hugh"

                            and <persRef ref="cobb-howell">Cobb</persRef> but the leaning of the
                            house was too strong the other way— <persRef ref="davis-richard">R. D.
                                Davis</persRef> made a very eccentric or disingenuous speech—denying
                            that there was any desire in the North for the abolition of Slavery in
                            the Southern States, and threatening an immediate dissolution of the
                            Union by the North, if the Southern States, should immediately abolish
                            Slavery— I presented a parallel, between the fire and fury with which
                            the house on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June 1842, passed
                            an act at the instigation of <persRef ref="white-edward">Edward D.

                            and the torpid lethargy of the house on this occasion— The petition was
                            finally referred to the Committee on the judiciary without instructions.
                            A motion was then made to adjourn; but failed; the yeas and nays being
                            called. <persRef ref="slidell-john">Slidell</persRef> moved to suspend

                            made an hour speech for the Bill, but the passion to pass it was so red
                            hot that it had not patience to hear him. <persRef

                            would not, and was laying out for an hour of argument, when Charles J.
                            Ingersoll told them there was no need of hurry, and moved the Committee
                            to rise, which they did and the house adjourned.— M<hi

                            and which it will be difficult to correct.— This morning at 10. I went
                            to the Capitol to meet the Committee on the revisal of the rules— Only
                            four members of the Committee met—Adams, <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
                                >Beardsley</persRef>, C. J. Ingersoll and <persRef
                                ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef>—no Quorum— Nevertheless, we
                            proceeded to compare the copy made in the <persRef ref="mcnulty-caleb"
                                >clerk’s</persRef> office under <persRef ref="french-benjamin"
                                >French’s</persRef> direction, of the Rules revised by the Committee
                            with the copy on which the amendments agreed upon by them were minuted
                            down, and we found some errors to be connected, and some rules requiring
                            further revisal.— We adjourned to next Tuesday morning at 10, hoping
                            that we shall then have a Quorum.— I have some concern about the manner
                            of printing the report— The discussion in the house will be difficult
                            and perplexed, unless the existing rules should be printed in parallel
                            pages with the proposed revisal; and if they are, the chances are that
                            the only important amendment made by the Committee, the exclusion of the
                            gag-rule will not be adopted by the house; or be replaced by the
                            substitute moved by <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> ten
                            times worse than the existing rule.— This I have no doubt is <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> real purpose, and that his solemn
                            parade of renouncing all opposition to the reception of abolition
                            petitions was a cheat— I borrowed in the Library, <persRef
                                ref="rose-william">Roses</persRef> Orlando Inamorato and Furioso,
                            and found his sword Durindana in both of them— In the Law Library I
                            borrowed the first Volume of a digest of the Pennsylvania Laws,
                            containing the first Act of the Legislature of that State to abolish
                            Slavery. I met <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Giddings</persRef> there and he gave me the document
                            containing the report of the <persRef ref="porter-james">Secretary of
                                War</persRef>— I stop’d at the general Post Office, and gave the

                            attended the morning public worship in the Hall of the House of
                            Representatives. The Prayer was made and the hymn read, and by two lines
                            at a time sung by <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            President of the Columbian College, from John 12.32. “And I, if I be
                            lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me”— An edifying, but
                            not very eloquent discourse— It was short—the whole service occupying
                            not more than an hour— The Seats of the members were generally filled;
                            though very few of them by themselves— We walked home with a bright Sun,
                            a clear sky, and a frosty, but kindly Northwester.— After dinner at the
                            second Presbyterian church, the <persRef ref="knox-james">Rev<hi
                                    rend="superscript">d.</hi> James Knox</persRef> preached from
                            Ecclesiastes 3.15. the latter part of the verse— [“]And God required
                            that which is past”— There is something obscure in the meaning of this
                            sentence— It is in the chapter which teaches that to every thing there
                            is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven— The meaning
                            of the passage is that God repeats the past or in other words that there
                            is nothing new under the Sun— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox
                            discoursed upon it, as if it had been, God shall call men to account for
                            that which is past, and made of it a fervid and minatory exhortation to
                            repentance—a Subject never more appropriate than at the close of the
                            year— The exhortation to repentance is indeed always in season, and the
                            episcopal prayer book by prescribing it as a perpetual prayer, takes for
                            granted that it is always needed and never effected. Always the same
                            general confession of enormous sins, and prayer for pardon— Always the
                            same promise of absolution upon true repentance and belief in the
                            gospel— Do they not thus become mere forms of words, without meaning?
                            And is the eternal scolding of a presbyterian preacher more efficacious
                            to work out repentance or absolution? We had evening visits from
                                <persRef ref="jesup-thomas;jesup-ann">General and M<hi
