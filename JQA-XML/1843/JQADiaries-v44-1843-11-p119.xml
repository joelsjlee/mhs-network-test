						<p>We landed at Cleveland at 7 this morning, and here parted from <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Standart</persRef>, one of
							our fellow passengers from Buffalo, by whose advice we had come on with
							out stoping at Ashtabula— From this place there are two modes of
							proceeding to Columbus, distant 232 miles—one by land stages traveling
							night and day with excessive bad, and very dangerous roads— The other by
							canal boat on the Ohio canal which will take us four days to reach
							Columbus, by the places enumerated in the margin— We were advised by all
							means to take the latter mode which we concluded to do, and took passage
							in the packet canal boat Rob Roy <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Phillips</persRef>— She was to depart at 2. O’Clock P.M. and in the
							meantime I was to undergo a reception— I was first recognized at the
							Barber’s shop, while being shaved, before breakfast. And immediately
							after breakfast a crowd of people thronged my chamber at the American
							hotel to be introduced and to shake hands with me. <persRef
								ref="allen-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John W.

							the citizens of all classes pressed into my chamber till M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen with two other members of the

							called at the house of <persRef ref="beattie-william">M<hi

								<persRef ref="beattie-sarah">daughter</persRef> of my old and true

								<persRef ref="u">brother</persRef> of <persRef ref="bradburn-george"
								>George Bradburn</persRef> told me that I should find him
							convalescent at Cincinnati— The reception was in a Church. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Andrews made the Address to me, which I
							answered as usual and shook hands with the men, women and children;
							after which we dined at the American hotel, and embarked in the

						<p>I came on board of the Canal Packet boat Rob-Roy, yesterday very unwell
							with my catarrh hoarseness and sore-throat, and some fever. this boat is
							83 feet long, 15 feet wide, and has besides the persons here named about
							20. other passengers— It is divided into 6 compartments; the first in
							the bow with two settee beds for the ladies, separated by a curtain from
							a parlors bedchamber, with an iron stove in the centre and side settees,
							on which four of us slept feet to feet.— then a bulging stable for four
							horses two and two by turns and a narrow passage with a side settee for
							one passenger to sleep on, leading to the third compartment a dining
							hall and dormitory for 30 persons; and lastly a kitchen and cooking
							apparatus with sleeping room for cook, steward and crew, and necessary
							conveniences. So much humanity crowded into such a compass was a trial
							such as I had never before experienced, and my heart sunk within me,
							when squeezing into this pillory I reflected that I am to pass 3 nights
							and 4 days in it.— We came on board the boat at 2. O’Clock the time when
							she was to depart, but it was 4. before she left the wharf.— We were
							obliged to keep windows of the cabins closed against the driving snow,
							and the stoves heated with billets of wood made the rooms uncomfortably
							warm. It was a comfortless evening, but before its close I found that
							our fellow travellers who shared the after cabin with us were well bred
							persons, and pleasant companions— <persRef ref="macy-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John B. Macy</persRef> resides at
							Cincinnati. His brother <persRef ref="macy-francis">Francis</persRef> at
							Portsmouth Ohio. His daughter <persRef ref="macy-charlotte"
								>Charlotte</persRef>, a handsome and amiable young woman from 17 to
							20, and <persRef ref="u">Miss Langdon</persRef> of Buffalo, from 25 to
							30. with fascinating manners substitutes for beauty relieved the
							tediousness of the evening. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Russell</persRef>, grandfather of Charlotte Macy was
							also of the company, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chamberlin</persRef> a young man who had met me at Cleveland with an
							invitation from the inhabitants of Akron to me to visit that place—
							About 11. O’Clock I took to my settee bed, with a head ache, feverish
							chills, hoarseness, and a sore throat and my tussis senilis in full
							force. After a restless, sleepless night, I rose twice; first at 4 and
							again at half past 6.— As soon as day-light came I was taken in a
							carriage to a hotel, where we had a plentiful breakfast. I was then
							taken again in a carriage to the town hall, where I was addressed, and
							answered by a short speech after which I shook hands with the men, women
							and children. Among the women, a very pretty one, as I took her hand
							kissed me on the cheek. I returned the salute on the lip, and kissed
							every woman that followed; at which some made faces, but none refused.—
							We returned to the boat, and continued all day our progress through the
							canal at the rate of about 2 miles and a half an hour— I was able to
							occupy part of the day morning and afternoon with writing in this diary—
							There was snow great part of the day—no enc<unclear>ou</unclear>ragement to open the
							windows or to view the country through which we pass.</p>

						<dateline>Packet Rob Roy. Ohio Canal Friday. 3. November 1843.</dateline>
						<p><date>3. VI. </date>Friday</p>
						<p>In the course of yesterday and this day we passed through the places
							named in the margin of Wednesday’s page. We reached Massillon last
							evening after dark, and it being a considerable place, there were
							symptoms of a desire on the part of its inhabitants to give me a
							reception— Several of them came on board the boat. Two or three were
							introduced to me, but I could not retain their names—we finally
							persuaded them to let us pass on quietly— As acquaintance became
							familiar with my fellow passengers; time slip’d away more cheerily. They
							are all kind and obliging.— The <persRef ref="macy-charlotte;u">young
								Ladies</persRef> very lively and good humoured. The weather has been
							so harsh and churlish that we have not been tempted to open our windows
							or to stand on the deck of the boat to see the country around us.— The
							banks of the canal are so muddy that there is no comfort in walking. We
							see we are in a beautiful country, with a deep, rich soil; but much of
							it along the borders of the canal is woodland, and much with the wood
							cut down, and the stumps standing like the pins of a bowling green, and
							presenting an aspect rather of desolation than of plenty. In the common
							dining room and dormitory I made out with no small trouble and
							inconvenience to write for about two hours in the forenoon of yesterday
							and this day, and one hour of each afternoon, to write in this diary,
							but without fully keeping up with the flight of time. We beguile some of
							our supernumerary hours, with card parties at whist and Eucre a game of
							which I had never heard before.— I write amidst perpetual interruptions,
							in the presence of half a dozen strangers, who seem to think me a
							strange sulky person to spend so much time in writing— The most
							uncomfortable part of our navigation is caused by the careless and
							unskilful steering of the boat into and through the locks, which seem to
							be numberless, upwards of two hundred of them on the canal.— The boat
							scarcely escapes a heavy thump at entering every one of them— She
							strikes and grazes along against their sides; and staggers along like a
							stumbling nag. We passed in the course of last Night through a
							settlement of Germans called Zoar, a community under an absolute ruler;
							and this day through Gnadenhutten, originally a Moravian Settlement, but
							now fallen into the ordinary track of breeding towns— This afternoon the
							sky cleared off and on approaching a placed called Roscoe, several of us
							landed and walked about a mile, when we were obliged to return to the
							boat. <persRef ref="johnson-william4">W. C. Johnson</persRef> despatched
							through the Post-Office a Letter which at my request he had written to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and
							addressed to her at Washington, advising her of our progress: I find
							myself utterly unable to write— About 8 this Evening, on taking a
							momentary look out, I saw a large circle round the moon whence I
							predicted foul weather for to-morrow morning— Spent the Evening at
							Eucre, and at 10 retired to my settee.</p>

						<p>About one O’Clock this morning <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell</persRef> came to my settee,
							and awoke me to communicate to me a Letter, just received from <persRef
								ref="mathiot-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Mathiot</persRef>, late Representative from his Congressional
							District in that body, residing at Newark, earnestly inviting me to
							visit him and that place, where we were to arrive about Sunrise.— The
							messenger was despatched with an affirmative answer, and I thought I
							slept no more for the remainder of the night— On reaching Newark we
							landed and walked to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mathiot’s house;
							where he and <persRef ref="mathiot-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Mathiot</persRef> received us with great cordiality. Here I was
							shaved by an eloquent Mulatto barber; numerous visitors came in who were
							introduced to me, all highly respectable looking men, but of whose names
							or faces my memory can give no account— After breakfast, we went to the
							town hall I believe crowded with good looking persons of both sexes, and
							there a gentleman welcomed me with a complimentary address which I
							answered as well as I could; after which I shook hands with them, men,
							women and children. we returned to the boat, and proceeded to terminate
							our navigation at Hebron. Here we took leave of the <persRef
								ref="macy-john;macy-francis;macy-charlotte">Macy family</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">Miss Langdon</persRef> whom we had found charming
							traveling companions—they proceed in the boat to Portsmouth where the
							canal reaches the Ohio river.— We are henceforth to go by Land stages to
							Cincinnati— There was a stage ready to start as we landed and a crowd of
							People at the door of the house— As I passed a gentleman in the midst of
							that crowd, addressed me by name, and with a very few complimentary
							words, gave me in the name of the inhabitants of Hebron a hearty
							welcome, for which I returned in words as bri<unclear>ef</unclear> assuring the Speaker,
							that of all the addresses with which I had been honoured by my fellow
							citizens, there was not one more gratifying to my feelings than which he
							had just uttered most acceptable to them. 8 miles from Hebron we came to
							Kirkerville, where we dined; and just as we were sitting down, in came
								<persRef ref="greene-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Greene</persRef>, one of the Committee of 3. sent by the
							Astronomical Society, to Cleveland, to accompany me to Cincinnati— They
							arrived at Cleveland Wednesday evening, after we had left that place—
							They returned by land to Columbus, whence M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greene came out with a somewhat more representative Stage Coach to meet
							us. To this we were transferred, and in it made our ent<unclear>ry</unclear> into
							Columbus about 4 in the afternoon. Crowds of people in the street, and
							the door of <persRef ref="neil-william">Neil’s</persRef> hotel where we
							lodge. At 8 in the Evening at <persRef ref="hoge-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogue’s</persRef> presbyterian Church,
							the <persRef ref="wright-smithson">Mayor of Columbus</persRef> welcomed
							me in the name of the inhabitants— I answered as usual—shook hands with
							the People, and returned to Neil’s hotel.</p>

							the penitentiary. We had also a fair view of the City, and surrounding
							country from the top of the <persRef ref="neil-william">Neil</persRef>
							hotel. At 11. O’Clock <persRef ref="mccoy-rw">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> R. W. M’Coy</persRef> called and accompanied us to the
							Presbyterian church where <persRef ref="hoge-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogue</persRef> discoursed as I
							thought I heard him say from Psalm 21.1.2. but on recurring to the bible
							I find that was not the text.— Of the sermon I have no recollection—
							There was nothing memorable in it— The house was heated by a furnace,
							and the atmosphere produced upon me a state of apathy and drowsiness,
							which suspended my attention and memory in somnolency. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogue is a presbyterian preacher of the
							last century; has been settled here 35 years, and is more acceptable to
							his people the older he grows.— After dinner I attended at the episcopal
							church and heard <persRef ref="dobb-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dobb</persRef> from 2. Timothy 4–7. [“]I have fought a
							good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith. 8
							henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
							Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day: and not to me only,
							but unto all then also that love his appearing.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dobb is quite a young man and his style of preaching bears
							the episcopal stamp— His sermon was a panegyric of <persRef ref="paul"
									>S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>— He had read the
							Evening service for the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity.— From the close of the afternoon public worship, until 11 this
							evening a succession of visitors disposed of my time— My catarrhal cough
							is returning upon me severely. The three members of the Astronomical
							Society of Cincinnati, who went to meet us at Cleveland and came back to
							meet us here are persons of great respectability, and in their
							attentions to me, full of kindness. <persRef ref="greene-william">M<hi

						<p>I awoke about two O’Clock this morning, and arose, but it was cold, and
							the fire in my chamber was extinguished— I returned to bed, and rose
							again at a quarter before 4— There was a remnant of fire in the
							adjoining parlour, and I wrote by that. A mulatto by the name of
								<persRef ref="jenkins-david">David Jenkins</persRef> came to see me
							just after daylight: the only time he said when he could expect to
							obtain access to me: to return the thanks of the coloured people of this
							city for my exertions in defence of their rights— He referred to a
							correspondence which he had had with me on this subject with me, and
							which I remembered.— We were to have left Columbus at 8 this morning;
							but there were two military companies of Germans, from whom I had
							received a message requesting leave to escort me out of the city, which
							I could not reject— It delayed our departure about an hour during which
							numerous visitors thronged the house; among whom was the governor of the
							State <persRef ref="shannon-wilson">Shannon</persRef>. The German
							companies, with a band of martial music, escorted us to the Scioto river
							and over it—and <persRef ref="neil-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Neil</persRef> accompanied us in person— Our first stage
							was 14 miles to Jefferson where there was a gathering of the people;
							with whom I exchanged greetings and shook hands— Then 14 miles to
							Springfield where we dined and a similar intercourse took place— Then 14
							miles to Dayton, on our approach to which we were met by a cavalcade,
							and a gentleman by the name of <persRef ref="u">Odlin</persRef>, with an
							elegant open barouche in which I took a seat, and thus in triumphal
							procession we entered the City of Dayton. as we reached the hotel where
							we were to lodge we found a vast multitude of the people assembled—and
							the mayor of the city from a stage erected in front of the house
							welcomed me in a complimentary speech, which I answered, standing in the
							open barouche— I then passed into the house between a dense mass of
							population on both sides; but as there was no general shaking of hands
							as usual immediately after the addresses, I was beset the whole evening
							by a succession of visitors in squads, to be introduced and shake hands,
							to every one of whom I was a total stranger, and the name of not one of
							whom can I remember— My friends <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph"
								>Grinnell</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-william4">W. C
								Johnson</persRef> give me all possible aid and encouragement in
							getting along, but the strangeness of these proceedings increases like a
							ball of snow. I cannot realize that these demonstrations are made for
							me, and the only comfort I have is that they are intended to manifest
							respect and not hatred My cough has returned and annoys me continually—
							It disables me also much for the labour of writing— This was the day
							when I should have arrived at Cincinnati—but the Committee of the
							Astronomical Society have made the arrangements so that we are to arrive
							Wednesday Noon.</p>

						<p>My Catarrh allows me little sleep in the Night. I was up at two in the

							again a succession of visitors to shake hands; with the interval for
							breakfast, a walk round the city, and two calls at the house of <persRef

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips’s while we were there, with
							whom we shook hands.— At 11. O’Clock we left Dayton, and rode 22 miles
							to Lebanon; before reaching which we were met by a large deputation from
							the Astronomical Society of Cincinnati—consisting of <persRef
								ref="burnet-jacob">judge Burnet</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="wright-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John C.
								Wright</persRef> and others— Also by a carriage and escort with

								ref="corwin-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Corwin</persRef>, heretofore a distinguished member of the house of
							Representatives of the United States, and late Governor of the State of
							Ohio, welcomed me, at the Presbyterian church; by an address of splendid
							eloquence— These premeditated addresses by men of the most consummate
							ability, and which I am required to answer off hand without an instant
							for reflection, are distressing beyond measure, and humiliating to
							agony— After these ceremonies, we walked in procession to the hotel,
							where crowds met and followed us— <persRef ref="storer-bellamy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bellamy Storer</persRef> came in from
							Cincinnati, and sundry others.— Through the whole evening there came a
							succession of visitors, among whom many Ladies— Supper—from which I
							retired early worn out with fatigue— Judge Burnet gave me a copy of the
							address which he proposes to make to me in the name of the Astronomical
							Society.— <persRef ref="johnson-william4">W. C Johnson</persRef> read to
							me the part of my manuscript Oration which I propose to deliver— A young
							Quaker limner of 19 or 20., took an egregious caricature likeness of me
							in pencil and told me that he took it for the bold, and intrepid manner
							in which I had defended and sustained the right of petition; for which I
							thanked him.— Afterwards he said another idea had occurred to him; which
							was, that if I would adhere with patience and perseverance to the
							principles that I have asserted and maintained, all would ultimately be
							well.— I told him I thanked him for his advice and hoped to profit by
							it— This dialogue was exceedingly diverting to <persRef
								ref="greene-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green</persRef>,
							who was present— The activity and unceang attentions of this gentleman
							since he joined us, have alleviated much my anxiety; but my catarrh, and
							excessive kindness drive me to despair.</p>

						<p><date>8. IV— V:45. </date>Wednesday.—</p>
						<p>I awoke and rose at four—but returned to bed and lay without sleeping
							till a quarter before six. We breakfasted at Lebanon, and proceeded 22
							miles to Cincinnati— We had now with us a numerous committee from the
							astronomical Society and on approaching the City met a large Cavalcade,
							with several Carriages, the <persRef ref="spencer-henry">Mayor of
								Cincinnati</persRef> and <persRef ref="mitchel-ormsby">professor O.
								M. Mitchel</persRef>. I descended from the Stage and was conducted
							to an elegant open Barouche with four horses, in which I took a seat
							with <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">judge Burnet</persRef> the Mayor of the
							City and professor Mitchel— The day was fine, and the Sun shone bright,
							but Cincinnati is embosomed in a circle of steep and lofty hills, at the
							turn of a corner in descending one of which the pole of our carriage
							snap’d short off and we were obliged to pass into an ordinary barouche
							and pair— An immense crowd of people followed us through the Streets, to
							the Henrie house in third Street, kept by <persRef ref="u">Major
								Henry</persRef> where lodgings were provided for us. In front of
							this house there is a large balcony overlooking the street upon which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer the Mayor, delivered a
							complimentary address—welcomed me to the City, and introduced me to the
							assembled multitude, who answered by deafening shouts of applause— My
							answer was flat, stale and unprofitable, without a spark of eloquence or
							a flash of oratory—confused—incoherent—muddy, and yet received with new
							shouts of welcome— The crowd then dispersed; but a continual succession
							of visitors beset my chamber till late in the evening leaving scarcely
							an interval for dinner and tea— The arrangements for laying the corner
							stone of the Observatory, and for the delivery of my Oration to-morrow
							were concerted, with Professor Mitchel, judge Burnet, and <persRef
								ref="greene-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greene</persRef>—but the address on the spot, in the act of laying the
							corner stone, was not yet prepared— Worn down with fatigue anxiety and
							shame as I was, and with the oppression of a catarrhal load upon my
							lungs, I sat up till one in the morning writing the address, which from
							utter exhaustion I left unfinished and retired to a sleepless bed. I
							fear I am not duly grateful to divine Providence for the blessing of
							these demonstrations of kindness and honour from my Countrymen, but I
							dread still more the danger of being pampered and elated into vanity by
							them.</p>

						<p><date>9. IV. </date>Thursday</p>
						<p>I rose again at four, and before breakfast, finished the address to be
							delivered at the laying of the corner stone— A succession of visitors,
							invitations and deputations ensued till ten O’Clock when a dense crowd
							of people gathered in the Street fronting the Henry house, and the
							procession of the members of the Astronomical Society was formed— An
							open Barouche with four horses was at the door; into which I entered
							with <persRef ref="burnet-jacob">judge Burnet</persRef> the President of
							the Society, <persRef ref="mitchel-ormsby">Professor O. M.
								Mitchel</persRef>, and<space/>. This was followed by other Carriages, an
							escort of Military companies with a band of music, and an innumerable
							crowd of people. As we entered the Carriage it began to rain, and we
							were obliged to raise the sides over our heads for shelter, and exclude
							the sight of me from the people and of the people from me— The
							procession marched round sundry streets, the rain increasing till it
							poured down in torrents. Yet the throng in the Streets seemed not at all
							to diminish— It looked like a sea of mud— The ascent of the hill was
							steep and slippery for the horses, and not without difficulty attained—
							The summit of the hill was a circular plain of which the corner stone
							was the centre. At the circumference, a stage was erected from which my
							discourse was to have been delivered; but the whole plain was covered
							with an auditory of Umbrella’s instead of faces. It was then determined
							that the discourse should be delivered to morrow morning in the
							Westleyan Methodist chapel, and the corner stone now laid; which
							ceremony I performed; and read the address which I had written last
							evening and this morning, to which the circle of hearers gathered around
							responded by three hearty cheers— My manuscript was so defaced by the
							rain, that it was scarcely illegible— The procession then dispersed and
							the Barouche returned and landed me at the Henrie house, leaving the
							only part of the ceremony important to me still to be performed— In the
							evening there was a temperance tea-party given by the Ladies of
							Cincinnati, and to which I had been invited by <persRef
								ref="burnet-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Burnet</persRef>, <persRef ref="staughton-louisa">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Staughton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="beecher-lydia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Beecher</persRef>.— It was held in a large theatre into which an old
							dwelling house of judge Burnet had been turned. I walked to it with
							judge Burnet, between a double line of a torch light procession of
							firemen— <persRef ref="wright-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								C. Wright</persRef> addressed me and presented me to the assembled
							Ladies— I answered.— <persRef ref="storer-bellamy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bellamy Storer</persRef> made a
							flowery speech, and <persRef ref="beecher-lyman">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

							Jones’s friends partook with us of the breakfast— I returned to the

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="burnet-jacob">judge Burnet</persRef> delivered an address of
							about half an hour’s duration; with some enlargement of the copy which

							him and to the Society for this address, I delivered about one half of
							the Oration which I had written, and it was well received. The house was
							full and overflowing— I spoke nearly two hours, without a symptom of
							impatience or inattention of the Auditory.— Resolutions of thanks to me
							and to judge Burnet were adopted by the Astronomical Society with
							requests of copies for publication—and a Resolution that the Observatory
							hill should henceforth be called Mount Adams.— I then shook hands with
							the members of the Astronomical Society, and all others in the church
							who desired it and returned to the Henrie house— A crowd of visitors
							followed— <persRef ref="morehead-james">Governor Moorhead</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="southgate-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>With <persRef ref="greene-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greene</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Foote</persRef>, I visited one of the Common schools of
							the city, for children from 4 to 16 years of age— There are 450 children
							at this school, and there are nine such in the City— Returning we stop’d
							to visit the houses of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greene and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Foote called the twinhouses— A deputation
							from the inhabitants of Covington, of which <persRef
								ref="morehead-james">Governor Moorhead</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southgate-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southgate</persRef> were members came at 10 O’Clock, took me into an
							open barouche and 4, and took me in the ferry boat over the river Ohio
							to Covington in Kentucky. We were received at the landing by an immense
							crowd which immediately formed a procession and marched with a military
							company and martial music to the episcopal church, where I was addressed
							with eloquent panegyric by Governor Moorhead; and answered to the best
							of my ability— The address was preceded by a fervent prayer from the
							Minister of the Church— The shaking of hands with men, women and
							children followed— A very pretty woman as she took my hand whispered—
							The first kiss in Kentucky; which I did not refuse.— Returning to
							Cincinnati I stop’d to visit <persRef ref="bedinger-george">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Bedinger</persRef> an Officer of the
							Revolutionary Army in the War for Independence, who told me he had been

							Mount Adams, the spot where I laid last Thursday the corner Stone of the

							valley, and of the surrounding hills, with the windings of the Ohio
							river, is eminently beautiful— It is 450 feet above the river, and no
							better site could have been selected for the building to be erected
							there— Before returning to the Henrie house we stop’d at a Daguerrotype
							Office where three attempts were made to take my likeness— I believe
							neither of them— Our friends dined with us and we took leave of them—
							About 4. p.m. we embarked in the Steamer Benjamin Franklin N. 6.

							final thanks and parting blessing to the people, to which they responded
							by repeated shouts of farewell— My duty has thus been performed, and I
							am now upon my return to my home, and to the discharge of other high
							obligations— There was a splendid evening and a magnificent display of

						<dateline>Ohio river. Maysville. Portsmouth. Tuesday 14. November
							1843—</dateline>
						<p><date>14. IV.30. </date>Tuesday.</p>
						<p>I have one of the State rooms in the Lady’s cabin for my bed chamber; but
							it is scarcely ten feet square in size, and has two beds, one of which
							is occupied by <persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef>.— The Night
							was nearly sleepless, and I was of course unfitted through this day for
							reading. I had received warm invitations from Maysville Kentucky, and
							from Portsmouth Ohio to visit them and receive a welcome.— Immediately
							after breakfast this morning, we reached Maysville 65 miles from
							Cincinnati— On landing, we proceeded with a dense crowd of people to a
							hotel where we breakfasted again, and then repaired with the Mayor and a
							large deputation of the citizens to the Methodist Church. There, I was
							welcomed to the city and introduced to the people in a highly
							complimentary address by the Mayor, which I answered, and as I had done
							at Covington, included in my remarks a just tribute of respect to
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>. And here I solemnly declared that the charges of
							corrupt bargaining which had been trump<unclear>ed</unclear> up against him and me were
							utterly without foundation. There has been a cordiality in my reception
							at Covington, and here, not surpassed even at Cincinnati But the impulse
							is from the friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and all the
							affectionate part of these caresses are meant for him— The mayor thanked
							me warmly for my answer and requested me at my leisure to furnish him
							with a copy of it for publication— I met here <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Landaff W.
								Andrews</persRef>, a member of the last Congress from this District
							but who failed to obtain a re-election— Also <persRef
								ref="russell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Russell</persRef>, late member from the Portsmouth District, Ohio;
							who came with a deputation from Portsmouth to accompany me thither.— I
							reimbarked, after shaking hands with all the People at the Church, and
							parted from Maysville, with firing of guns, ringing of bells, waving of
							handkerchiefs and huzza’s. Idle morning.— I sought an hour of repose on
							my bed, during which a Steamer from Pittsburgh passed by us, and saluted
							with 3 cheers— At 1/2 past 3. p.m. we reached Portsmouth 55 miles from
							Maysville, and went again through the same ceremony— A procession to a
							market house, where the women were within the house and the men without,
							where on a Platform between the two, <persRef ref="peck-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peck</persRef> read me an address of
							three long pages, to which I gave a short answer.— After the shaking of
							hands we returned in procession to the Steamer. Here <persRef ref="u"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Anderson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="macy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. P. Macy</persRef>,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Russell, and the deputation
							left us— We have numerous fellow passengers, men and women— I passed
							great part of the day in the Lady’s cabin to which men are here
							admitted. Of the passengers in the Lady’s cabin, are <persRef ref="u;u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>We passed by Galiopolis about 4 this morning, without seeing it, and
							reached Marietta, at half past 3 this afternoon. I had received
							invitations to visit Marietta, and landed there with the usual
							demonstrations of welcome, a great crowd of people—guns fired; bells
							rung and a procession to the presbyterian church, where an address of
							welcome was read by <persRef ref="u">judge Putnam</persRef> a son of
								<persRef ref="putnam-rufus">General Rufus Putnam</persRef>— In my
							answer, referring to the interest I had always taken in the city of
							Marietta, I related the incident of my visit to the <persRef
								ref="cutler-manasseh">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Manasseh
								Cutler</persRef> at his house in Ipswich hamlet, after his return
							from his visit to Marietta in 1788. and of my conversation with him
							concerning the Western Country at that time. And I said that from the
							time of that conversation, I had taken a deep interest in the whole West
							and watched its progress step by step to its present great and
							flourishing condition— These remarks were received apparently with
							lively satisfaction, and the shaking of hands, was with a heartier
							squeeze than almost anywhere else. After this ceremony, I took a short
							ride round the city, to visit the remarkable Indian Mounds in this
							place— There is no tradition indicating when, or by whom or for what
							purpose they were constructed, but they are very extensive and the
							central mound is about forty feet high, two hundred feet square at the
							base, and one hundred at the top, perfectly formal in its symmetry—
							There is an Article upon these works, by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Manasseh Cutler, in the first volume of the transactions of the American
							Academy of Arts and Sciences. When we returned to the Steamer, a
							committee of 3 members, <persRef ref="cutler-ephraim">Ephraim

							<persRef ref="emerson-caleb">Caleb Emerson</persRef>, and <persRef

						<p>Between 2 and 3 this morning we passed by Wheeling in Virginia, where

							<persRef ref="denny-harmar">Denny</persRef>, <persRef

								>Darragh</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Stevens</persRef> came, on
							board to meet us.— As we passed by Wheeling a gun was fired from our
							boat, and returned from the shore— There had been talk at Wheeling of
							inviting me to the place and giving me a reception— Many persons wished
							it and many thought an invitation had been sent to me but there was
							none— We passed equally by Steubenville in Ohio, and Beaver in
							Pennsylvania without notice.— The deputation from Pittsburgh had
							expected our arrival there to morrow morning, and all the arrangements
							had been made for a magnificent reception at that time Among the rest
							all the fire company association had held meetings and passed sundry
							Resolutions for having a grand display of their own; and <persRef
								ref="brentlinger-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brentlinger</persRef>, as a deputation a copy of their Resolutions
							one of which was that I should be conducted to some public building
							where I was to be addressed in their name, and should be requested to
							deliver an Oration— And a temperance association, not to be behind hand
							with the firemen, had held meetings, and chosen a deputation to invite
							me to deliver an Oration upon Temperance— I delivered to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brentlinger an answer declining to
							pronounce the Oration to the Firemen. I shall take the same course with
							the Temperance association— The Pittsburgh deputation were sadly
							disconcerted at our arrival before the time, and seriously proposed that
							we should land at Rapps settlement of Economy, pass the night there, and
							proceed to Pittsburgh to morrow in another Steamer to be sent down for
							us. But this project was abandoned, and at half past 3 in the afternoon
							we landed at Pittsburgh There was a considerable crowd of People
							assembled on the wharf to whom from the Steamer M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harmar Denny introduced me by name, and who received me with
							3 cheers.— The Mayor of the City <persRef ref="hay-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Hay</persRef> came on board
							to meet me, and at my own request, walked with me to the Exchange Hotel,
							followed by the crowd who were notified that the Procession and
							Reception would take place, to morrow morning, as it was regulated by
							the programme published in the newspapers of this day.— The multitude
							then after three cheers dispersed; but individuals were pressing in the
							whole evening. We had pressing Letters from <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kennon</persRef> of Washington Pennsylvania, and from <persRef
								ref="stewart-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew
								Stewart</persRef> of Uniontown, to know the precise moment when we
							shall arrive at those places. We first determined to go on Saturday to
							Washington; and on Monday to Uniontown; but on remonstrances from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Denny we concluded to remain over the
							Sunday at Pittsburgh, and to go on Monday to Washington, on Tuesday to
							Uniontown, and we wrote accordingly— Wednesday to Cumberland— Thursday
							home.</p>

							believe, I should believe that this special Providence comes to pass for
							the chastisement of my pride and Vanity— The Scene of laying the corner
							Stone of the Astronomical observatory last week at Cincinnati, has been
							repeated with still more mortifying circumstances this day at
							Pittsburgh.— That Pageant was intended to promote the cause of Science
							in the minds of the People— It had a moral purpose—an important end to
							the attainment of which I heartily concurred— Had the day passed off
							successfully and without accident, the impression left on the minds of
							the Spectators and hearers would have been favourable to the
							accomplishment of the undertaking and honorary to me— The inexorable
							rain was literally a flood of cold water poured out on the whole
							ceremony. All was disappointment— But my duty and the purpose of the
							Society in their invitation to me were performed.— The Corner Stone of
							the Astronomical Observatory was laid, with supplication by me to the
							throne of Heaven that the erection of the building may be conducive to
							the improvement of the condition of man upon Earth— It is not for man to
							exult, even in his good intentions— It is his duty to bear
							disappointment, even of the best purposes with resignation and
							equanimity— The pageant of this day was of no earthly importance. It was
							ostensibly all honorary to me.— I had been invited by the city
							authorities to visit the city on my way to or from Cincinnati, and it
							was a reception— A large procession, at the head of which I was
							exhibited in a barouche with four handsome horses, accompanied by the
							Mayor of the City <persRef ref="hay-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hay</persRef>. <persRef ref="denny-harmar">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harmar Denny</persRef> and <persRef

							with military companies, martial music, and all the companies of the
							fireman’s association, in their respective showy and variegated
							uniforms, traversed through the abundant mud streams all the principal
							Streets of the City, with an heavy drenching rain pouring down all the
							time— We returned to the same Exchange, whence from an open balcony,
								<persRef ref="mccandless-wilson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Candless</persRef> delivered by heart the welcoming address of
							which he had sent me a copy. My answer was very short, apologizing for
							having come before the time, and declaring my unwillingness to detain
							them in the rain.— The procession then terminated; the crowd dispersed;
							but came up in squads to my chamber to shake hands with me through the
							whole day.</p>

						<p>I had renewed applications yesterday from the fireman’s association, who
							had determined at all events to have their torch light procession, and
							equally resolved to have an Oration from me; but I again declined— I did
							the same with the Temperance association, at the head of whose
							deputation <persRef ref="wilkins-william">judge Wilkins</persRef> made
							the application to me. Judge Wilkins is a member of the approaching
							Congress elect, and told me he would leave home on Monday for
							Washington, and offered me a seat in his carriage which I declined for
							the engaments to visit <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kennon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stewart-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stewart</persRef>. I also received yesterday a large deputation from
							the Liberty party with an address and a request that I would meet, and
							address them.— This I declined on the ground of having been invited
							here, by the concurrence of all parties, I am interdicted from
							discoursing upon topics of deep party feeling—but in a speech of about
							20 minutes, I gave my opinions without reserve on all the Slavery
							questions now in agitation— One of the members of the deputation brought
							me this day, a meagre and most imperfect abstract of part of my speech
							which he proposes to publish as a report of the speech. I reminded him
							of several most important omissions; and there were others which I did
							not notice— I received yesterday and this day, Letters informing me of
							my election as an honorary member of the Webster and Tilghman Literary
							Societies; to which I answered by Letters of acceptance— We had last
							evening a very elegant party and supper at <persRef ref="denny-harmar"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harmar Denny’s</persRef>— This
							morning I wrote from the time of rising until 8. upon my journal; and

								ref="biddle-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> I crossed the Monongahela, in the ferry boat, and
							visited <persRef ref="lorenz-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lorenz’s</persRef> Ironworks, and another establishment, where we
							saw the process of rolling and hammering iron—and the work of the red
							hot ball, hammered into a bloom, and the blast— Thence recrossing the
							river we ascended to the top of the Court house whence beautiful
							prospects were in view. The junction of the Monongahela and Allegany
							rivers—the Allegany city itself, and the hills all around Our next visit
							was to <persRef ref="u">Captain Howard</persRef> and the Iron ship on
							the Stocks which he is building for the Government— We saw one of the

						<p>After returning to the Exchange Hotel at 3. p.m yesterday, I received the

								<persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grinnell</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-william4">M<hi

							<persRef ref="u">mother</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">brothers</persRef>
							and sisters, a respectable family in private life. She was not at home,

							and the Mayor announced me to the company.— I addressed them in a few
							words of thanks for the honour done me by them, and of excuse from
							physical disability, for declining a large discourse—after which they
							let me off with three bouncing cheers, while I heard a single voice
								saying—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams give us a speech— They
							then strolled off to <persRef ref="mccandless-wilson">M<hi

						<p>We left Pittsburgh at 8 O’Clock this morning, for Washington
							Pennsylvania— My stay at Pittsburgh from Thursday last when we reached
							it has been tumultuary, honorary, and inexpressibly irksome. I had
							received from Pittsburgh at various times testimonials of sympathy which
							had already bound me in gratitude to the city; and I was pleased with an
							invitation which gave me the opportunity of expressing in person my
							gratitude to the People; but these mass meetings at which I find myself
							held up as a show, where the most fulsome adulation is addressed to me
							face to face in the presence of thousands, and where long premeditated
							written discourses are read to me, to be answered without a moment of
							reflection, all this is so adverse to my nature, that it has in a great
							measure solved the continuity of my existence, and I am like one coming
							out of a trance or a fainting fit unconscious of what has been passing
							around me. This morning <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ewing</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reed</persRef> the disputation who came to meet us at Pittsburgh,

							coach and travelled with us in it, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baird</persRef>, <persRef

							Mayor of Pittsburgh, and <persRef ref="denny-harmar">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harmar Denny</persRef> accompanied us
							over the Monongahela ferry, to the summit of the heights opposite the
							city, and there took leave of us.— To the unremitting kindness and
							attentions of these gentlemen during the whole of our visit here I have
							been under the greatest obligations— I answered last Evening a very
							earnest invitation from Somerset Pennsylvania with an enclosure
								from<space/><persRef ref="pearson-samuel">Pearson</persRef>, which
							required a special Letter though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearson
							is a total stranger to me. I received also a Letter of invitation from
							the <persRef ref="shriver-thomas">Mayor of Cumberland,
								Maryland</persRef> through which we are to pass.— Our stage travel
							this day was the first we have had on this expedition— Tis only 25 miles
							from Pittsburgh to Washington; but it took us the whole day to travel
							them. Our first stage was to the halfway house— But nine miles short of
							Washington was Canonsburg and Jefferson College.— Here we met <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kennon</persRef>, and a cavalcade from Washington, but <persRef
								ref="brown-matthew">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef>
							the President of Jefferson College insisted upon my going to it; and
							there addressed me extemporaneously, and welcomed me in the name of the
							Officers and students to whom he introduced me— I answered the address
							and shook hands with the Students and others— Then returned to the
							Stage, and proceeded to Washington followed by the increasing files of
							horsemen coming out to meet us— Military company— Committee of
							reception. Exchange Hotel— Dinner—rain and mud.— Walk to the Court
							house—dense crowd of people— Address of welcome to me from the President
							of Washington College— My answer. Shake hands with the multitude— Walk
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kennon’s house— <persRef

						<p>The Stamina of my Constitution, are sinking under the hardships, and
							exposures of traveling at this Season and at my time of life, aggravated
							by the continual overwhelming kindness of my political friends, and the
							empty honours, showered upon me ostensibly by the People as I pass
							along, but embracing only a part of the People, and carrying with it no
							solid permanent opinion.— They bring to my heart no feeling of Pride—to
							my mind no new or useful truth— Momentary joy, at the experience of kind
							treatment from my fellow men, and Vanitas vanitatum as spoke the
							inspired preacher.— O! Curas, hominum! o, quantum est in rebus inane! as
							spoke the <persRef ref="persius">Roman Poet</persRef>; bring me to the
							only just conclusion, humble submission to divine Providence— My racking
							cough all last Night, left me scarce an hour of sleep, and no repose— I
							was up at 3 and again at 4. and wrote on the arrears of this Diary, from

							they drank, and to which I responded by my thanks, and by giving the
							County of Washington, the town of Washington, and the College of
							Washington Pennsylvania. Success, Prosperity and happiness to all who
							belong to them. He then let me off to bed— This day we came 25 miles to
							Brownsville; where we dined; stopping ten minutes at Centreville on the

						<p>I passed a Night of torture, with a hacking and racking cough, and

							totally dispirited before I rose for the day.— We had 62 miles of hard

							were confined to our own Stage. 62 miles over a rode frozen as hard as a
							granite rock—for the change from rain to hard frost, took place in the
							course of the last night, and this day we had January weather and a
							clear sky.— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> M

							Monongahela river.— The cold was here so intense that I estimated
							<persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer at 20— Our company of the three stages dined
							here, but I fasted; and derived from it the benefit of relief from the
							headache, and lighter suffering from my other complaints— The country
							through which we travel is chiefly covered with wood— Oak and Chesnut
							principally, with very little of the evergreens or needle wood— Many of
							the trees are strait and disproportionately lofty to their size— None
							remarkably large— None equal in diameter to the old elm on Boston
							Common— The forests have the ragged appearance which defaces all the
							woodlands throughout this whole Country—lofty dead, blasted trees,
							standing as stumps the image of desolation Others half uprooted and half
							fallen, lying across the living trees adjoining them and marring their
							beauty— Others <unclear>agroun</unclear>, prostrate stretched along the ground, and
							entangling the way.— The woods are solitary too. Scarce a beast or a
							bird to be seen— Not even a Crow or a Rook— Our after dinner ride of 26.
							Miles to Cumberland was all descending; and about halfway, the Stage
							driver pointed out to us the dividing line, between Pennsylvania, and
							Maryland.— We reached Cumberland about 7. O’Clock. It was dark. There
							was a small gathering of People at the door of the hotel, who readily
							accepted the proposal to defer the reception till to-morrow morning</p>

						<p><persRef ref="benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef> slept in my chamber. The
							night was not so distressing, as that in Uniontown, but still much
							afflicted— I went to bed soon after nine, and was awakened and roused by
							coughing fits at eleven, at two and at four this morning, with no
							conscious sleep in the intervals.— At four I rose, dressed and wrote
							till 7.— We travelled this day on the Railways from Cumberland to
							Washington city.— There was breakfast, of which I took a single cup of
							Coffee— Neither Mayor, nor committee of reception made their
							appearance—a number not large, perhaps a hundred of respectable looking
							men, and half as many boys, gathered at the hotel or followed me to the
							railway depot, and shook hands with me as I was seated in the Car— Just
							after Sun rise, at half past seven we started, and rode<space/>Miles to
							Harper’s ferry to dinner— <persRef ref="breese-sidney">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sidney Breese</persRef> U.S. Senator
							from the State of Illinois was in the same Car with me; and spoke to
							me.— I did not recognize his person though I have seen him before, and
							have had some correspondence with him. Most of the country we came
							through this day was within the bounds of Virginia— A plain open
							champaign country, covered with alternate fields of pasture, and of
							green winter wheat just out of the ground— At Harpers ferry where we
							arrived about 2. p.m the offal of a train of Cars from Baltimore, was
							left for our party to dine upon— I found myself at table by the side of
								<persRef ref="tappan-benjamin2">Benjamin Tappan</persRef> U.S.
							Senator from Ohio, and <persRef ref="wilkins-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilkins</persRef> member of the house

							road— Harper’s ferry I remember with pleasing and sad recollections of
							the Congress party from Georgetown, in the Iron canal boat on the
							Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, in June 1834.— It looks much now as it did
							then— We now proceed on the Baltimore and Ohio rail-way, pass <persRef
								ref="u">Ellicott’s</persRef> Mills with other reminiscences, and at
							the dusk of evening 5 p.m. reach the relay house and Thomas’s viaduct,
							nine miles from Baltimore— Here we land with our baggage from the Cars,
							which proceed forthwith to the monumental city. We wait half an hour for
							the Cars coming thence for Washington City—take our seats in them, and
							at half past 7. land safe at the foot of Capitol hill— <persRef

							We went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							nothing in the estimation of the world In my motives and my hopes it is
							considerable. The people of this Country do not sufficiently estimate
							the importance of patronizing and promoting Science as a principle of
							political action and the Slave oligarchy systematically struggle to
							suppress all public patronage or countenance to the progress of the
							mind— Astronomy has been specially neglected and scornfully treated—
							This invitation had a gloss of showy representation about it, that
							wrought more on the public mind than many volumes of dissertation or
							argument. I hoped to draw a lively and active attention to it among the
							people, and to put in motion a propelling power of intellect which will
							no longer stagnate into rottenness.— I indulge dreams of future
							improvement to result from this proclamation of popular homage to the
							advancement of Science, and am willing even to see my name perhaps
							ostentateously connected with a movement to which I so long and so
							anxiously strove to give an impulse in vain— For whatever of vain-glory
							there may be in this self approving reflection I pray to be forgiven—
							But I return to my home with the symptoms of speedy dissolution upon me—
							I had no conception of the extent to which I have been weakened by this
							Tussis Senilis—or Pneumonia Notha, or Old Mans cough— My strength is
							prostrated beyond any thing that I ever experienced before—even to total

						<p>A tolerable night— More undisturbed sleep, than I have had for many days

							and lay on the Sopha, all but lifeless— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi

							time to Idleness.— On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> day of last
							May I left the house where I now write for my home at Quincy,
							Massachusetts.— I had been since the close of the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress on the preceding 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March, afflicted with this grave-yard
							cough— It had however subsided; but returned upon me for a fortnight,
							two days after my arrival at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								sons</persRef> house in Boston, on the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of May. On the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that
							month I went out with his family to Quincy, where in the course of a
							week of quiet, the cough disappeared— On the 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of May I delivered before the Massachusetts historical
							Society in Boston, a discourse on the New-England confederacy of 1643.
							which I had written since leaving Washington. On the 4<hi

							Charles Francis, delivered the Boston city Oration on the anniversary of
							our National Independence. I dated on this day, my Letter to the

							anniversary of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August, the day
							of emancipation of the British West-India Negroes. On the 6<hi

							returned to it on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August, after
							an absence of one calendar month on a tour to Lebanon and Saratoga
							Springs Montreal, Quebec, Niagara Falls, and Western New-York— On the

						<p>My cough presses with renewed aggravation, and brought me up between two
							and three of the morning—and though I returned to bed, I enjoyed no
							further sleep— I went with my Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William
								C. Johnson</persRef> to the second presbyterian church and heard the
								<persRef ref="knox-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knox</persRef> preach from Psalm 51.14
							[“]Deliver me from blood-guiltiness O God, thou God of my salvation; and
							my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.” He began by an
							exposition of the object of this Psalm, penitential and expiatory for
							the murder of <persRef ref="uriahthehittite">Uriah</persRef>— He dwelt
							with laudable vehemence on the atrocious nature of the crime, and
							supposed the contrition of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> for
							having committed it deep and agonizing and gave the account of the
							transaction in all its horrid and disgusting details, and with a weight
							of censure upon David equally severe and uncompromising he turned upon
							his auditory, and charged us all with having blood guiltiness upon our
							souls; and then such fervent appeals to our consciences, such solemn
							expostulations, such terrific comminations, such awful forebodings, for
							the salvation of our souls, that I could scarcely account for my own
							insensibility— For our blood guiltiness consisted not in our own
							infidelity or indifference to the duties of religion, but in our
							remissness in our exertions to convert the impenitent sinners of our own
							families and firesides. We are responsible for their unrighteousness,
							and in suffering them to perish in their sins we are guilty of their
							blood, to all eternity— There is a fallacy in this reasoning so gross
							that it is inconceivable to me how it can make an impression upon <hi
								rend="italic">any</hi> mind— This M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Knox has been very recently setled here as the Pastor of this
							Presbyterian Church— The negotiation, with the <persRef ref="ely-ezra"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Ezra Styles Ely</persRef>,
							D.D. pending when I left this city last May, terminated unsuccessfully.—
							I did not attend the afternoon service— There was none at S<hi

								Son</persRef>, at Boston, to be disposed of according to the
							provisions of the Will, because the property being in the State of
							Massachusetts was out of his jurisdiction, and being bequeathed in
							special trust to my Son, he did not see that the Executor had anything
							to do with it— If controversy should arise, it was a case for chancery
							jurisdiction in Massachusetts, but perhaps it might be proper to deposit
							a copy of the Will, in the Registry of Probate at Boston— I went to the
							House where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson last resided

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>—</date> Several months have passed away,
							without any summary record at their close of the regular manner of
							passing my time during their progress— Two months of daily travel, and
							two elaborate Orations, have cut up my Summer into driblets— But I have
							risen the whole Season through between 4 and 5. and after an hour or
							hour and a half of dressing, have written till breakfast— The incidents
							of travel occupied the remainder of the day for the two months; and in
							the intervals when I have been at home the composition of my discourses
							has absorbed all my hours— Since my return here, my disease has not
							disabled me for my usual employments, but they have been confined to the
							recovery of the arrears of this Diary; nine days of which had crept
							in—now redeemed.</p>
