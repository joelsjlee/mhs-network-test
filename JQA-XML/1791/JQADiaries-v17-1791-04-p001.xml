								ref="stillman-samuel">Doctor Stillman’s</persRef> family, and lives
							with his daughters. Her countenance is pleasing, not very handsome, her
							manners very reserved, but not disagreeable. I have been several times
							in company with her, but there is something forbidding about her: I
							never heard her say a good thing, nor have I observed any thing
							remarkably <hi rend="strikethrough">amiable</hi> graceful in her
							demeanour. Yet let not this testimony pass, without adding that she has
							many enthusiastic admirers. <persRef ref="lowell-john">Lowell</persRef>
							thinks her a none-such, and of course all the females within the
							canonical degrees of affinity to him reecho the applause, which he
							bestows with great liberality, upon her. Lowell censures or commends
							with a vengeance and his Sisters and cousins are not without their share
							of the same failing. These people value themselves upon their strong
							feelings. Yet strong feelings are not becoming to the human species, and
							more especially to women.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Not to admire is all the art I know.”</l>
						</lg>
						<p>And with this maxim (says a person of great authority in my mind) it is
							necessary to adopt another which is “not to despise.” There is no truth
							of which I am more convinced.— However, as Miss Morgan is so
							uninteresting upon the acquaintance which I have with her, perhaps it is
							best to let her for the present, rest in peace.</p>
						<p>I had some conversation with Johonnot. He is going to Demarara, upon a
							speculation. He professes not to know himself what his object will be
							upon his arrival there, and I believe he says truly.</p>
						<p><pb n="3" type="ms"/>This speculation may possibly succeed, but if I know
							Johonnot, the greatest difficulty, which he will meet with in life will
							be the result of his own instability of character. He has not
							perseverance enough to be successful in scarcely any pursuit, for
							perhaps of all human qualities this of perseverance is in general the
							most useful.— He is easily discouraged, and indeed his opening in life
							has not been such as could satisfy a young man, of warm passions and a
							lively imagination.— He told me that he considered himself as
							unfortunate, and that he was determined if possible to run away from
							misfortune. His education he said had been principally in Europe; but
							there was a fundamental error, which had been the source of much
							unhappiness to him, and from which he was now recovered. He had been
							told in early youth, nay it had been instilled into his mind: with a
							cruel assiduity that he was born to great things; that his genius was
							extraordinary, his abilities commanding, and that he would undoubtedly
							come forward into the world like a phenomenon, and carry all before
							him.— This pernicious idea once implanted in his mind, had taken deep
							root in a soil perhaps too well calculated to produce spontaneously a
							weed of a similar nature. Just upon his return from Europe, he lost his
							Grandfather, <persRef ref="cooper-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Cooper</persRef>, a man highly respected in this Country, and who
							might have been highly serviceable to him in promoting his introduction
							to the world. <persRef ref="johnnot-gabriel">His father</persRef> at the
							same period was totally ruined, and the disposition of the world was
							sufficiently prone to connect the character of the son with the failure
							of the father. He had himself in the course of a foreign education
							adopted habits of life, and manners, which were displeasing to his
							countrymen; and he was not perhaps so much attached to theirs as every
							man must be with those of the people with <pb n="4" type="ms"/>with whom
							he lives in order to be happy. Instead of the applause and success which
							he had been taught to expect he found himself an unpopular character,
							with many enemies, and with nothing to boast of from Friendship.— To a
							man who had feelings he said this reverse in the real situation, of that
							which he had anticipated, must be painful; and he considered these
							circumstances as sufficient to authorise him in saying he was not
							unacquainted with adversity. He had given up all his extravagant
							fancies, and all his romantic expectations; he wished henceforth for no
							more than a decent and honorable maintenance, and to acquire that he was
							willing to leave his country and seek his fortune in more hospitable
							climes.— He spoke with feeling. He spoke with eloquence. I doubted
							whether his present determination were judicious, but I respected his
							principle, and my mind acknowledged the truth of his observations. Most
							heartily do I wish he may succeed; for his failings have been
							sufficiently punished, his Vanity sufficiently humbled, and I hope the
							errors of his disposition corrected— But His own principal endeavour
							henceforth ought to be to acquire perseverance, and fortitude, which is
							a virtue perhaps of more practical utility through life than active
							resolution, unrestrained by a cool and sober judgment.</p>
						<p>I went with Callender and spent the remainder of the evening at <persRef
								ref="higginson-stephen2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

						<p><pb n="5" type="ms"/>There was an annular eclipse of the Sun this

								ref="callender-john"><hi rend="italic">J. Callender</hi></persRef>.
							and <persRef ref="lowell-john"><hi rend="italic">J.
								Lowell</hi></persRef>.</p>
						<p>The evening was dull. Miss Amory performed upon the Piano Forte, which
							was amusing; she sung, and sings well. Callender likewise and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Codman sung. The latter has a very good voice.—
							But there was not much ease apparent in the Company. There was a
							formality, not unusual in parties of this kind, which favoured too much
							of restraint to allow much happiness to any one. I believe we were all
							relieved when we separated. Some of the Ladies rallied Callender upon
							his seriousness. This is allowable in polite companies, where there is
							any degree of familiarity; yet as such reproaches never fail to increase
							the failure itself, I do not think them perfectly consistent with
							politeness. It is the peculiar privilege of friendship in retirement to
							enquire into the reasons of low Spirits. In mixed companies it never
							should be done. It cannot dispel the gloom, and a benevolent disposition
							will never sport with dejection.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Rebecca Amory</hi> may be about 18. She is too robust
							in stature, &amp; rather too irregular in feature to be perfectly
							beautiful. She has however a fine complection, a delicate skin, the
							roseate bloom of Health, and an eye sufficiently expressive to
							captivate, a man who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> <pb n="6" type="ms"/>is not systematically
							indifferent. Lowell she has thoroughly captivated. He has for these two
							years tendered his humble Services to her, and she receives them with
							pleasure. Nothing but fair prospects of Life seem at present to be
							wanting to complete the union— She is reserved in temper, though I
							believe candid &amp; benevolent. There is a little hauteur that
							involuntarily hangs about her, it bars my sociability with her. In
							general I am not disposed to be familiarly acquainted, with an unmarried
							woman engaged to another man; indeed I know not the reason why, but
							instinctively I avoid such women much more than those who are already
							married; I have never examined the grounds of this disposition which
							results from habit rather than from reason; but Miss Amory independent
							of this circumstance has manners rather forbidding, and I feel not
							enough interested to wish to overcome the difficulties of approach.
							Lowell is assiduous: even a little jealous: perhaps this renders her
							rather more distant to others than she would naturally be.— More upon
							this subject I cannot say.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Mary Amory</hi>, her Sister is a year or two younger.
							By Nature, not much favoured, and as usual atones for her deficiency in
							point of beauty by the excellency of her disposition. She is good; but
							her goodness is not perhaps esteemed so much as it deserves, because she
							is not handsome, nor even graceful. Her manners are not rough; but they
							have not the nice and delicate polish, which render sometimes deformity
							itself amiable: neither has she any of that sprightliness of wit, that
							charming vivacity, which sometimes serves as a substitute for personal
							charms. She is too amiable to class among the insipids, and yet unless
							she has some qualities, which I have not discovered, (and my
							acquaintance with her is indeed very small) I know not in what other
							class she could claim a rank.</p>
						<p><pb n="7" type="ms"/><hi rend="italic">Sally Higginson</hi> is verging
							rapidly towards 25. Nay, I know not but what she has already attained
							that formidable period. She is not handsome; it is her misfortune; and a
							cruel misfortune it is to every woman of sense and feeling; say the
							Sentimentalists what they please. Yet Miss Higginson is much admired:
							every one speaks well of her. The cold approbation of rational Judgment
							is always in her favour. But the instinctive plaudit of sensibility is
							not for her. In truth she is rather too sensible. There is something in
							the very nature of mental abilities, which seems to be unbecoming in a
							female. But in addition to this Miss Higginson talks much; she always
							talks well but her conversation <hi rend="strikethrough">has</hi> is too
							judicious to be perfectly pleasing in such a constancy of continuation.
							The woman who talks a great deal is excusable only when she says many
							lively things; some witty, a few judicious and most of all extravagant
							or without much meaning. Such in general is the character of the most
							interesting coquettes. And the general aversion to coquette’s proceeds
							on the part of men principally from fear; on that of women always from
							envy. Miss Higginson sometimes laughs. I know not any thing that a
							sensible woman should attend to with more nicety, than her manner of
							laughing. Indeed if a Lady can suppress it altogether, she will find
							that a smile beaming forth good nature and benevolence is a much more
							captivating substitute. The loud laugh is unsufferable. The giggle is
							contemptible. The titter is ill-bred, and the sneer though sometimes to
							be admitted must be used with infinite caution. The lovely smile,
							expressive sometimes of pleasure, sometimes of complacency, and always
							of innocence seems to be the only native inhabitant of the female face.
							Yet Miss Higginson laughs. Nay her laugh is not even studied— It seems
							to be but the clumsy expression of a painful <pb n="8" type="ms"
							/>convulsion. I wish some of her friends would hint to her the
							improvement which she could easily acquire. Her goodness of disposition,
							her uncommon prudence and discretion are the theme on which her friends
							dwell with peculiar pleasure. These are qualifications highly valuable,
							and too rarely found among our young Ladies. But alas! my taste is
							naturally depraved. Prudence and Discretion never will possess the
							peculiar charm for me. I revere them as virtues; I should be sorry to
							find them strangers to the object of my Affections. Yet freely must I
							confess it, never can they rouse those affections, never can they deeply
							interest them. Should my Heart ever yield itself to the voice of Love, I
							hope my Judgment will approve, though it must never pretend to direct
							the Passion.</p>

								>S</hi><hi rend="superscript italic">t:</hi><hi rend="italic"> John’s</hi>.
							The evening was tolerably pleasant. The conversation rather general,
							sometimes Sentimental. J. <hi rend="italic">Lowell</hi> got hold of
								<persRef ref="lavater-johann">Lavater’s</persRef> maxims, read off
							several of them and expounded them with self complacency and a full
							conviction of his own ingenuity. Yet methinks I could willingly submit
							to all the disgust occasioned by such cool and immovable
							self-sufficiency, to derive the advantages which that confidence offers
							for success in the world. I am not fully satisfied upon this point in
							Speculation, and I defer my determination until experience shall give me
							a more extensive ground to stand upon. But to return to Lavater’s
							maxims.— We sat in a kind of semicircle the circumference of which came
							about to the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi>
							<pb n="9" type="ms"/>middle of the Room. There was a table out of the
							bounds of the circle upon which stood a couple of candles. Lowell had
							got his Lavater, and stood by the side of the table, bending himself
							towards the light, to read a maxim. “A great woman not imperious”—he
							stopp’d, held his book open in his left hand, and turning towards us to
							mention instances, as he named them raised his right hand upwards &amp;
							stretch’d out his fore-finger, as a summons for our attention—<persRef
								ref="knox-lucy">“M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Knox”</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="bingham-anne">“M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bingham.”</persRef> It
							was silly, but I was much more so. “Your example fails you” said I “no
							woman can less deserve the imputation of being imperious than M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Bingham.” I speak only said Lowell “of the
							character which common Fame gives her. I have not been to the southward
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Adams.”— Never was poor Devil more deficient
							in point of repartee than I am. The reflection fell with its full weight
							and I had no address to throw it back upon his shoulders, which I
							certainly did not want inclination to do, and to which he was very open.
							I was Silent; it was the only weapon left me, and he proceeded in his
							Lecture.— What could tempt me to say any thing about M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs:</hi> Bingham, as if I meant to display an acquaintance with her
							I know not. It might be a lurking Vanity imperceptible to myself; though
							there are few persons of whose acquaintance I have less reason to be
							vain, or whose acquaintance I less value.— I myself think it was simply
							an intention to deny the truth of the aphorism itself, which naturally
							led me to deny the illustration. In my unnecessary zeal, I did not
							consider, the inference which malignity might naturally draw, and in
							such a blundering manner drew upon myself the implied sarcasm, contained
							in the Latter clause of his speech.</p>
						<p><pb n="10" type="ms"/>Crafts was urged to sing. he refused; and persisted
							though unreasonably urged; Callender sung one or two songs &amp; then
							retired complaining of an headach. We separated between ten and eleven
							and I came home with Crafts.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Barbara Higginson</hi>, is in her 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> year. Her complexion dark but clear; her eyes black and
							expressive; hair black; curled in beautiful ringlets, and of as fine a
							texture as any that I ever beheld. She is tall; tolerably well formed,
							though not perfect in the proportions of elegant shapes— She should wear
							an hoop. The features of her face are regularly handsome; her eye-brows
							beautifully arched, her teeth good, and in the estimation of many, is
							the handsomest woman in Boston. Yet Young, and beautiful as she is,
							there is yet a charm which she does not possess. Every one admires her,
							as he would admire the Venus de Medecis— It is lovely, but it is a
							statue. Her manners are not soft; she laughs more, and her laugh is more
							clumsy than that of her Sister. Indeed she laughs often somewhat loud,
							when the cause of her merriment in the opinion of her companions is
							scarcely adequate to raise a smile. She is not very lively; not very
							well informed even for her age, and of course her conversation does not
							support the interest to which her personal superiority at first sight
							entitles her. She entertains very strong prepossessions for or against
							the persons with whom she is acquainted, and perhaps the rapidity of
							youthful decision does not allow her to examine well the grounds of
							those judgments, which are so energetic. To become thoroughly pleasing
							the asperities of her character and manners ought considerably to be
							softened: those who are more acquainted with her would be better enabled
							than I am, whether there are <pb n="11" type="ms"/>not likewise
							asperities of disposition which require correction.— Of the rest of this
							company more occasionally.</p>

							too much of <hi rend="italic">fine women</hi> for him. There is a
							display of elegance and of fashion about them; which is really
							disadvantageous to them. I am pleased to see even a little decent
							weakness in the manners of a woman. This kind of state, like gravity is
							of the very essence of dissimulation. Where it is adopted, and pursued,
							you might see a woman an hundred times without seeing a single
							characteristic trait— It is not pleasing for it puts every one upon his
							guard— A woman of sense, will show something amiable even to the
							greatest stranger. There is a natural communication between the heart
							and the manners; and this professed elegance always destroys it.—
