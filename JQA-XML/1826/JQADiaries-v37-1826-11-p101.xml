								<persRef ref="tucker-samuel">Captain Tucker</persRef> had told him
							Lieutenant Barron died, because, after the amputation of his leg, the

							had induced him to invent a machine to regulate the movement of a Cot on

							Mazatlan, in the Province of Sinaloa; California; under the Government
							of Mexico— I found the papers after some search, and desired M<hi

							a Commission to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kennedy— <persRef
								ref="hough-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hough</persRef> came

							I advised him to apply to the Department of War— <persRef

							to be taken of <persRef ref="canning-george">G. Canning’s</persRef> Note
							upon the interdiction by Great Britain, of our trade with her West-India

							attend, I should wish a consultation with the members of the

							this new term of British policy—in which revenge appears to be the

							Clay that as this note, not only refused to negotiate upon the subject,
							but declared a determination to adhere to the interdiction, even if the
							United States would now agree to remove all discriminating duties, there
							was no alternative left us, but resistance or submission— That my own
							sentiment was in favour of resistance; but that the choice must be left
							to Congress where it would occasion violent debate; and where it was to
							be expected the opposition would take side against us. It would be
							necessary to communicate to Congress all the correspondence relating to
							this Colonial trade for some years back, and I wished him to direct the
							making of the copies at the Department of State, immediately; including
							the part of the Instructions to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							relating to this subject— The Sun rose clear, but the day was stormy— I
							planted in a corner of the Garden six Chesnuts from the Trees of which
							the nuts were planted by <persRef ref="washington-george">President

									>l.</hi> Thayer</persRef>, Superintendent of the Military

								>l.</hi> Thayer, apprizing him that the course was taken in
							preference to a direct official call through the Department of War, and
							said I had no doubt Thayer’s answer would present the subject in a light

							raised some pretension of appointing the Postmaster there themselves,
							which was quite inadmissible; and that Thayer was now under a
							prosecution for false imprisonment, at the suit of this man whom he had
							prohibited from coming to the Point, and whose name is <persRef ref="u"

								Smith</persRef> came to enquire again concerning the devise to him
							by <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>; and the amount of his
							own debt to me. I shewed him his two Notes; one of 27. April 1814. for
							$1088:03. and the other of 10. July 1818. for $200. He said there were
							200 dollars more, which I had lent him at two several times, 100 dollars
							each, but for which he had not given Notes— I said that not possessing
							evidence of those debts I had not claimed them— He said they were
							equally due, and he would give me an order upon the Executors for the
							full amount including them— But he wished the Executors then to pay the
							balance of the devise to his order, as he wished to have the merit of
							paying his own debts—by his own Acts and Will; and without the
							interference of others, assuming the Province of the Law— I told him
							that I had directed the attachment to be made, with a view to the
							payment first of his debt to me, and to the other members of his family
							if they should wish to have the benefit of the attachment, particularly
								<persRef ref="dewindt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Wint</persRef> and <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>; and then to prevail

								ref="forrest-richard">R. Forrest</persRef>, to <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. de

								ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Gray</persRef>, or to <persRef ref="gray-francis">F. C.
								Gray</persRef>, or to both, debts which I believed existed and ought
							to be paid but the amount of which I did not know— That my object was to
							prevent other creditors with less meritorious debts from acquiring a
							preference for the payment of them by a mere priority of attachment, and
							that with regards to the debt due to me, it was not my intention to
							derive personally the benefit of one dollar for the payment of it— He
							said that he had been twice under the necessity of <pb type="ms" n="103"
							/>declaring his inability to pay his debts, and that it had been his
							determination to pay them, if he ever should be able— That he should
							therefore now be obliged to give equally public notice to <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi> his Creditors, that there was this sum
							deposited in the Bank at Boston, and leave it thus to be disposed of— I
							said I had no objection to his taking this course— I had no personal
							interest in the distribution, and was entirely willing that it should be
							disposed of as the Law should direct. He then said this would operate
							very hard upon him— That he supposed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
							Wint and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye would be willing to wait
							for the payment of the debts due to them, and he was in immediate want
							of five hundred dollars to provide for the current expenses of his
							family and enable him to get along without continually anticipating his
							Salary. I said that if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Wint, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye would say or write to me that they
							were willing the attachment should be removed so far as concerned their
							claims, it should immediately be so— He left me, after making a minute
							of an alteration I had suggested as proper in the Order upon the
							Executors, for the payment of his debt to me— <persRef
								ref="warrington-lewis">Commodore Warrington</persRef> recently
							arrived from Norfolk called for a visit— <persRef ref="weightman-roger"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weightman</persRef> the Mayor of

							Engineer Officers for the graduation of the City according to the
							original plan of 1791. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weightman
							expressed the wish that <persRef ref="bernard-simon">General
								Bernard</persRef> might be appointed— I spoke to <persRef
								ref="foy-john">Foy</persRef> about laying off a small piece of
							ground within the yard walls of the House, for planting nuts and acorns,
							and other seeds of Forest Trees, and asked him also to select two or
							three spots where I could plant some of the Spanish Chesnuts from
								<persRef ref="peters-richard">judge Peters’s</persRef> garden, and
							where if they should come up, the trees may remain without being
							transplanted— I would make a Nursery here, where the experiment might be
							tried of raising forest trees, foreign and domestic, from the seed, nut
							or acorn— I rode out with my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>, and gathered some acorns in the Woods—chiefly from
							Black Oaks— We found but few, the Season being about a month too far
							advanced— John and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> dined

								Southard</persRef> came to converse with me, upon various subjects
							of current business in the Department of the Navy, such as the

							Schooner now bound to sea, and two or three Midshipmen— He afterwards
							sent me a Commission, which I signed, of 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
							Lieutenant of Marines for <persRef ref="lee-thomas3">Thomas
								Lee</persRef>, grandson to a former <persRef ref="lee-thomas2"
								>Governor of Maryland</persRef>, recommended among others by
								<persRef ref="carroll-charles">Charles Carroll</persRef> of
							Carrollton, the last surviving Signer of the Declaration of
							Independence— He had several Candidates for the appointment of Purser,
							between whom he was somewhat embarrassed to make a Selection. Strong
							suspicions of improper conduct having lately arisen, against the person,
							whom he would otherwise have preferred: Suspicions of his having himself
							written an anonymous Letter which he shewed as having been received by
							him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said he was desirous of
							having a purser, even in the smallest vessel; the duties of that office
							being otherwise necessarily performed by the Captain, which placed him
							in a double relation to the men, detrimental to discipline— He said
							further that there were several applications for Midshipman’s Warrants
							in behalf of Cadets, discharged from West-Point: among which was one for
							a youth named <persRef ref="forsyth-james">Forsyth</persRef>, a native
							of North-Carolina, son of <persRef ref="forsyth-benjamin">an Officer who had been
								killed</persRef> in the public Service, and now in the process of
							education at the charge of the State— He was last year reported for
							dismission, but retained at the earnest interposition of the delegation
							from the State. He must now be dismissed, for incapacity, but with
							testimonials altogether favourable to his character, temper and conduct.
								<pb type="ms" n="104"/>The <persRef ref="burton-hutchins">Governor
								of North-Carolina</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">General
								Daniels</persRef> now here are urgently soliciting for him a
							Midshipman’s warrant— I said it sometimes happened that a youth
							incapable of making much proficiency in study, was yet well suited to
							the business of active life and particularly to that of a Seaman— As
							there was positive evidence of this young man’s good conduct, I would
							give him another chance of making himself useful, and try him as a
							Midshipman— But the Warrant should not be granted to other dismissed
							Cadets, of whose conduct there was no favourable report; as it would be
							degrading the whole corps of midshipmen, to turnover to them all the
							refuse of West-Point— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said he
							was examining the proceedings of the Court-Martial in the case of
							Lieutenant <persRef ref="smith-constantine">Constantine Smith</persRef>,
							and thought he should be ready with his opinion next Monday. <persRef

							Country, in support of Captain <persRef ref="symmes-john">John Cleves
								Symmes’s</persRef> theory that the Earth is a hollow Sphere, open at
							the Poles— His Lectures are said to have been well attended, and much
							approved as exhibitions of genius and of Science— But the Theory itself
							has been so much ridiculed, and is in truth so visionary, that Reynolds
							has now varied his purpose to the proposition of fitting out a voyage of
							circumnavigation to the Southern Ocean— He has obtained numerous
							signatures in Baltimore to a Memorial to Congress for this object, which
							he says will otherwise be very powerfully supported— It will however
							have no support in Congress. That day will come, but not yet nor in my
							time. May it be my fortune, and my praise to accelerate its approach.

						<p><date>5. VI:45.</date> Sunday— Sun rose beclouded— Gloomy day with little

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>, from Psalm 119.133. “Order my steps in thy word:
							and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.” A desultory, and
							impressive moral discourse; setting forth by various illustrations the
							different modes by which iniquity may obtain dominion over us. Among his
							quotations from Scripture was that of the first seven verses of the
							fifth Chapter of Isaiah: the song of the vineyard that brought forth
							wild grapes— In this instance as in numberless others I was struck with
							the careless inattention of my own mind when reading the Bible— I have
							read the chapter of Isaiah containing the parable I dare say fifty
							times, and it was altogether familiar to my memory—but I had never
							perceived a fiftieth part of its beauty and sublimity— The closing verse
							of the parable especially which points the moral of the allegory speaks
							with irresistible energy. “For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the
							house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked
							for judgment but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a
							cry.” The parallel is pursued no further. He had said in the parable how
							the vineyard would be destroyed, and here after declaring what the
							vineyard was and what its fruits had been he leaves the conclusion of
							ruin and destruction to the imagination of the reader. This art of
							selecting ideas to be presented, and of leading the mind to that which
							is not expressed, is among the greatest secrets of composition—to make
							the suppressed thoughts like the Statues of Brutus and Cassius at the
							funeral of Juria most resplendent because they are not exhibited in the
							highest effort of skill. <pb type="ms" n="105"/>After the Service, I
							called upon <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> who
							is yet confined to his chamber in an exceedingly debilitated state, but
							without fever— He says he has been five days without apparent change for
							better or worse. I had some conversation with him upon the British
							interdiction of our Colonial trade— Upon the Military Courts-Martial,
							upon whose sentences I am to decide, and upon the various objects in the
							War Department, to be touched upon in the annual message. He said all
							the Reports from the subordinate branches of the Department were in
							preparation, and would be very shortly brought to me. He spoke also of
							the board of officers assembled here to prepare a system of cavalry
							tactics and of Artillery Instruction for the Militia— Under a Resolution
							of Congress at their last Session; and said their Report was nearly
							ready— I next called upon <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> whose <persRef
								ref="rush-richard2">Son</persRef> died this day week, and who has
							not since left his house. I found him however composed, and he said he
							should go to the Treasury to-morrow. I mentioned also to him my wish for
							the Statements of Revenue and Expenditure necessary for the preparation
							of the annual Message; which he said he had ordered to be made out, and
							he thought would be ready to-morrow— We had also much conversation upon
							the British Colonial interdiction, and of the decided spirit of
							hostility to this Country indicated by it, and by the British Minister
								<persRef ref="canning-george">Canning’s</persRef> note— He urged the
							necessity of exhibiting to the public all the previous correspondence
							upon this subject, which I told him I had determined should be done— He
							observed that he had seen the hand of <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tazewell</persRef> in some
							comments of the Southern papers, charging the Government of the United

						<p>The whole day was absorbed by these visitors. <persRef ref="armistead-f"
								>Armistead</persRef> is a young Man, who has been two or three years
							soliciting a Commission, as a Lieutenant in the Marine Corps,
							recommended by <persRef ref="newton-thomas">T. Newton</persRef>, the
							Representative from Norfolk, and others— He has had some encouragement
							to expect success, and has been informed of the appointment of Saturday
							of <persRef ref="lee-thomas">T. Lee</persRef>, who he says first applied
							last June— <persRef ref="wallack-richard">Richard Wallack</persRef>
							informed me that the order endorsed by him in blank upon the Executors
							of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, which was sent me on
							Saturday is in full for the Notes endorsed by <persRef
								ref="forrest-richard">R. Forrest</persRef>, and for which he is
							liable. <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, brought me from <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
								>W. S. Smith</persRef>, an order upon the Executors of my father for
							the debt due to me, and an order in favour of Frye himself, which I
							thought it would be necessary to have altered— It includes a sum of 300
							dollars, which Smith drew last December, a Bill for; upon his brother
								<persRef ref="smith-john">John</persRef>, and which Frye endorsed;
							it was protested, and has been lying ever since last June at the Navy
							Department, Frye having until this day had no notice of the protest—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye took a receipt in full for my
							debt, together with Smith’s two Notes, to deliver them to him— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> being here witnessed my receipt— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye afterwards came back with a new order
							from Smith in his favour, but with a blank which I thought it necessary
							should be filled up— He took it again away for that purpose— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had two large bundles of
							recommendations of various persons for the appointment of a purser and
							for that of a Lieutenant in the Marine Corps— We went over them all, an
							occupation of nearly three hours, and finally fixed upon a person named
								<persRef ref="etting-henry">Etting</persRef> for the purser, and
							upon Armistead for the Lieutenant— I also recommended that a Warrant of
							Midshipman should be sent to <persRef ref="penhallow-samuel"
								>Penhallow</persRef>— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> brought some papers
							from the Department of the Treasury, and two large bundles had already
							been sent me of applications and recommendations for appointments under
							that Department. There was another difficulty to remove <pb type="ms"
								n="106"/>with regard to the delivery to <persRef
								ref="nicoll-francis">Francis H. Nicoll</persRef> of some of <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thompson’s</persRef> Teas: the question
							was whether before delivery he should be required to pay the duties for
							them in cash; or only to give bonds. It was thought sufficient to take
							bonds— I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush a letter from Nicoll
							to me on this subject received yesterday, with two enclosures, which I
							desired him to send back to Nicoll— The papers from the Treasury to be
							used for the preparation of the Message are not yet quite ready—
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> had sent me two private Letters from <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">General P. B. Porter</persRef> concerning the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Ghent Treaty; and
							his observations on the proposition of <persRef ref="vaughan-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan’s</persRef> Note—but
							there is yet an official Letter from Porter relating to it which I had
							not seen— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay in speaking of New-York,
							asked me if I had entire confidence in <persRef ref="brown-jacob"
								>General Brown</persRef>— I said yes— He appeared to think that
								Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown’s attachment to <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, might have some
							effect upon his conduct, and intimated that he had heard, Brown had been
							made the channel of a communication from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef> to Clinton, to secure his co-operation
							against the present Administration, on a conditional pledge in the Event
							of his own success, to make way for him at the end of four years. I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, I did not believe this— It was
							likely enough that such whispers from electioneering subalterns may have
							reached M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s ears— But no pledge
							upon which he could place any reliance could be given by Jackson
							himself, and none by his pretended supporters without displacing or
							abandoning <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>. The Condition
							of New-York is indeed precarious, and her policy, like that of Clinton,
							is cold, cautious and reserved— The next election yet depends upon the
							chapter Accidents, but behind that is a wise, unerring hand— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								grand</persRef> came and dined, and spent the Evening till ten
							O’Clock with me—arguing profoundly to convince me of the expediency of
							appointing him Collector of the Port of Philadelphia, or a Director of
							the Bank of the United States— <unclear>On veut etre Napoleon—sinon Prefet—ou
							bien gensdarme</unclear>— He has come all the way from Philadelphia for this—and
							the Steam boat from Frenchtown in which he came, ran ashore in the Night
							on Pool’s island, where they stuck fourteen or fifteen hours, and were
							then taken out by the Steam-boat from Norfolk. Degrand says <persRef
								ref="robertson-unknown3">Captain Robertson</persRef>, of the
							Steam-boat Constitution, which ran aground, has no energy— I had a
							rhumatic head-ache this Evening.— Lost my days walk.</p>

								ref="leland-aaron">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

							another person named <persRef ref="sawyer-frederick">Sawyer</persRef>,
							and had himself recommended his appointment— I saw no reason for
							changing on account of the last received Letters and directed the
							appointment of Sawyer, and that the new candidate should be informed his
							application came too late— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> came with the order
							from <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>, the
							blank being filled—he had also the cancelled check, on the Bank, upon
							which Smith’s Note to him had arisen. He also brought me an order from
							Smith, for the balance of the 3000 dollars payable to him by the devise
							from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, for which Frye said
							Smith expected I should send him the money— But as the debt due to
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								De Neuville</persRef> was yet to be provided for, I did not receive
							the order but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye took it back. <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">De grand</persRef> called upon me twice, and

							persons of good standing, large Stockholders, and having an interest in
							the prosperity of the Bank would be indispensable— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							brought some of the Statements and papers relating to the condition of
							the Revenue, to be used in the preparation of the Message, but took them
							back again, not yet having them complete— He finds the prospects of the
							Revenue for the present, and the ensuing year, less flattering than he
							had expected yesterday. There will be a falling off in the receipts <pb
								type="ms" n="107"/>of nearly three Millions, from those of the last
							year; those of the next year will be still more curtailed— M<hi

								<persRef ref="steele-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Knight</persRef> came with a Petition, for the discharge of her Son
							named <persRef ref="u">Falconer</persRef>, a Soldier who deserted nearly
							two years since, and is now she knows not where— So she says— Her
							petition affirms that in January 1825. the then <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef> promised her that her
							Son should be immediately discharged but that he was not. And that last
							Summer upon her renewal of her application, <persRef ref="jones-walter"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones</persRef> the Adjutant
							General, in the absence of the Secretary of War told her that nothing
							could be done for her— Her petition was supported by the signatures of
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> S.
								Smith</persRef> and others. I told her I was apprehensive it would
							be impossible according to the established regulations of the army to
							grant a discharge for her son, while he was an avowed deserter; but that
							I would make the proper enquiries, and inform her to-morrow. I sent to
							ask <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> to call upon me—
							His aid, Lieutenant Vinton came, and said he had been several days ill,
							and could not come out— I gave <persRef ref="vinton-john">Lieut<hi

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Knight, desiring him to shew it to Gen<hi

							from the Congressional District to which he belongs— I sent to ask
								<persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forrest</persRef> to call on me, and he came— I enquired if the
							order which <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>
							gave to <persRef ref="wallack-richard">R. Wallack</persRef>, covered the
							whole debt for which Forrest had made himself liable, by endorsement— He
							said it did— He also said it had originated in a debt of Smith’s
							contracted at Pensacola— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> brought me the
							statements and documents from the Treasury to be used in the preparation

							though amounting to near three Millions, in comparison with the last,
							will not be to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, beyond the
							estimate of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush in his Report of last

							would do him an act of kindness to let him know the reasons urging that
							he should resign, to relieve me from the otherwise necessary
							consideration of the question of his removal— He also read me an extract

							indict <persRef ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thomson</persRef>, <persRef

								Graham</persRef> came to recommend the immediate appointment of a

								ref="cox-nathaniel">Cox</persRef>, being recommended by <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							respecting the removal of a Land Office in the State of Ohio to Tiffin,
							which seems to agitate and divide the whole State. <persRef ref="u"
								>Kennedy</persRef> said he was from Middletown Connecticut and had

								ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef>— Said also he had

								<persRef ref="wertz-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wertz</persRef> came again to solicit the delivery to him of his
							Commission as a Justice of Peace— I told him I had not yet made the

							in his case, if he would come again towards the close of next week—
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> coming in soon afterwards I requested him to make
							the enquiries, what has been Wertz’s conduct, for some Months past,
							which he engaged to do. <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> came with sundry
							papers soliciting a loan, in behalf of the Unitarian Congregation, and
							with a hope that I would purchase the pew which I hire in their Church—
							I told him that being the only person of my family that attend the
							Church, I should not wish to encumber myself with the property of a pew—
							That as to a loan, my own Estate was now so much involved that I could
							dispose of nothing without an assurance of punctual payment; and that my
							experience of lending money to religious Societies was not encouraging—
							The Columbian College owed me a very large sum, of which they pay
							neither principal nor interest; and the Presbyterian Church of <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef> a
							small one; which they treat in the same manner— The compulsion of the
							Law cannot be applied to such Institutions, and they seem to consider
							the payment of their debts as not among the obligations of Christianity.
							I said however that recently the Columbian College had promised to make
							some provision for paying interest, which if they should carry into
							effect, I would assist the Unitarian Church by subscribing to their
							loan— I would therefore postpone giving him a definitive answer—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Knight</persRef>
							came and I was constrained to tell her that <persRef ref="u">her
								Son</persRef> while a Deserter could not be discharged— It was an
							ungracious answer to give to a woman and a mother, but I could give no
							other— <persRef ref="harrison-gustavus">Captain Harrison</persRef> of
							some revenue cutter, who has given me no small trouble before came with
							an appellate claim from the Treasury, for pay while he was here,
							settling his Accounts— I promised to look over his papers and give him
							an answer— <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major
								Vandeventer</persRef> brought me copies of the Powers from the late
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef> under which he
							received the annuities payable to the Seneca Indians— He brought me
							certificates of U.S. 6 per Cent Stocks, standing in the name of the
							President of the United States in trust for the Seneca Indians for more
							than 70,000 dollars, of loans now paid off and the interest upon which
							has ceased— Transfers were endorsed upon them to be signed by me, to
							receive payment of the principal, which then must be reinvested in
							stocks bearing an interest— I think the three per cents. <pb type="ms"
								n="109"/>One of the certificates, was a renewed certificate, dated
							this day, yet made out in the name of <persRef ref="madison-james">James
								Madison</persRef> President of the United States; which at my desire
							was altered, to the President of the United States for the time being—
							Vandeventer says that these Stocks were to secure to the Seneca Indians
							an annuity of six thousand dollars a year— But the practice has been to
							deposit the dividends of Interest in Bank to the credit of the Treasurer
							of the United States, and to pay the annuity to the Indians from the
							appropriations of the year. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

							should be allowed, he having died on his way to the place of meeting— I

						<p>I made a race round the Capitol Square by way of experiment to ascertain
							in how short a time I could perform it and was exactly one hour by the
							Clock on my Mantle piece. <persRef ref="lane-robert">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lane</persRef> came for my decision
							upon his claim; it appeared by the Report of the Secretary of the Navy,
							that the Negroes for the maintenance of whom he claimed, at the rate of
							40 cents a day per head, for two years were actually not in his custody
							one month—many of them not ten days— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> had made out an
							account for the actual time amounting to 420 dollars— I told Lane, I
							doubted whether I should direct the payment even of that— I said that
							the presentation of such a claim, was a transaction, the character of
							which I knew of no honest word to designate— The Court had decreed that
							the Negroes should be placed in the custody of three persons, authorised
							to employ them in work to pay for their cloathing and subsistence, and
							upon <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> that they should cause no expence
							to any person— They were so delivered: received and kept upon that
							condition; and this man charges 32000 dollars for keeping them two
							years, that is as long as he had the office of Marshal not having had
							them in his charge after the order of the Court a single day— He said
							that <persRef ref="armstrong-francis">Armstrong</persRef>, the present
							Marshal had been paid by my express direction, for the same charge,
							after he came into office; and that the Marshals of Georgia and
							Mississippi had been paid, for keeping the same negroes. The payment of
							Armstrong’s charge was by my order upon a Report of the Secretary of the
							Navy— But Armstrong had them actually in his charge; by an order of the
							Court, which authorised him to employ them at moderate work to pay for
							their maintenance: Armstrong was allowed something additional, which the
							order of Court did not prohibit; though if I had known of this order of
							the Court, I should not have sanctioned the additional payment: That to
								<persRef ref="morrell-john">Morel</persRef> the Marshal of Georgia
							was made by direction of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, much to my
							dissatisfaction, though it being business of the Navy department, I took
							little part in the affair— Of the payment to the Marshal of Mississippi
							I knew nothing. <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef> the Clergyman came with a petition of
							two persons to be discharged from prison, to which they have been some
							months confined for an assault and Battery— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker it must have the signature or
							recommendation of one of the Judges, or of the District Attorney; to
							obtain which he took it away. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kinsman</persRef> of
							Philadelphia, and <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dudley</persRef> of Virginia— Reed said he was the <pb type="ms"
								n="110"/>person who some time since had made an experiment in this
							house of an improved steam-machine: the others professedly came only
							upon a friendly visit. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kinsman spoke of
							my having heard <persRef ref="bedell-gregory">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bedell</persRef>, an episcopal clergyman, preach here,
							and at Philadelphia— <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major
								Vandeventer</persRef> brought me the Powers; and I desired him to
							write to <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef>, President of the U.S. Bank, to ascertain on what
							terms a purchase of U.S. 3. per Cent Stocks may be made— <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnston</persRef>, the Senator from Louisiana, came and left with
							me a Letter, soliciting my interference for the institution of a
							tribunal to try the validity of Land-titles in the purchased
							territories— He had sent me a Letter from <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas H. Benton</persRef> the
							Senator from Missouri, to him and <persRef ref="bouligny-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouligny</persRef> the other Louisiana
							Senator, enclosing a Memorial to me, from certain persons in Missouri,
							claiming my recommendation to Congress of measures for confirming
							Land-grants, which they complain they have not been able to obtain— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Benton asks the aid of the Louisiana
							Senators to the Memorial. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benton’s
							movement is one of his electioneering engines for securing his own
							re-election as a Senator— He has also another motive in it, well suited
							to his character, which is more of the Cethegus Class than any other man
							I know in this Country— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> read me a Letter he had
							received from Georgia, concerning the culture of the Silkworm, and
							proposing bounties upon the manufacture of sewing Silk. I asked him to
							direct some further Statements to be sent me from the Treasury, for the
							preparation of the Message; and suggested for his consideration, the
							expediency of recommending again to Congress a loan of ten or fifteen
							Millions at 4 1/2 per Cent or 5. redeemable in 1829 or 1830—with which
							so much of the six per Cents now or at the end of this year becoming
							redeemable might be paid off— It would save one per Cent a year or more
							upon the whole of the amount of the loan— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush hesitated upon this measure, because it had been recommended last
							Winter and was not adopted by Congress— But it was then very doubtful
							whether the loan would succeed; there is now every probability that it
							would. If it had then been authorised it would have saved 90000 dollars
							to the public even this year; and if it should fail again the
							responsibility would rest not upon us but upon Congress— We discussed
							the subject till M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush considered it more
							favourably, and he will write to the President of the Bank to ascertain
							if they would not undertake the whole or a part of the Loan— <persRef
								ref="lee-william">W. Lee</persRef> came to ask permission to go for
							a week or ten days to Philadelphia, to advise <persRef
								ref="stewart-charles">Commodore Stewart</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia">his wife</persRef> about their separation— She
							has written to me to request my interposition— I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee to tell her that wishing to render her
							any service in my power, it would be impossible for me to take any step
							in it without first knowing that it was equally the desire of Commodore
							Stewart as her own— That she had further annexed a condition of
							listening to no accommodation which would separate her from her
							children, which would of itself render all agency of mine ineffectual.
							Lee said that the Children were <persRef ref="stewart-delia2">a daughter
								about eleven years</persRef> old, and a <persRef ref="u">son, about
								seven</persRef>— That the Commodore offered to let her take the
							girl, but insisted upon having the boy himself— This I thought
							altogether reasonable, observing that by Law, he had the right to take
							them both, and that he ought to take the boy to place him in a way to
							receive a good education— Lee requested me also to decide upon the case
							of <persRef ref="alberti-edwin">Lieutenant Alberti</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard called early in the Evening, and

							interdiction of our shipping in their Colonial Ports— In reading this,
							and the defence of Lieutenant Alberti, and other papers relating to his
							trial I was occupied till past eleven, and then in writing a Remission
							of the unexecuted part of the Sentence of the Court Martial, and of the
							suspension of his pay and emoluments, midnight approached before I
							retired to bed. I wrote nothing upon the draft of my Message, and the

								Southard</persRef> brought me the papers relating to the trial of
								<persRef ref="smith-constantine">Lieutenant C. Smith</persRef>—and
							made some remarks upon my draft of a decision, which he thought right on
							the whole, but doubtful as to part of the reasoning. He thought it
							countenanced the idea, that <persRef ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Henderson’s</persRef> conditional
							forbearance to prosecute Smith for his misconduct at the Navy Yard here
							last December was equivalent to a pardon— I had stated that the right of
							the Commander of the Marine Corps to convene a general Court Martial was
							now undoubted— There was among the papers a copy of a Letter from
								<persRef ref="smith-robert">Robert Smith</persRef> when Secretary of
							State, in answer to an enquiry from <persRef ref="wharton-franklin"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Wharton</persRef>, then
							Commander of the Corps, which said that he had the <hi rend="italic"
								>exclusive</hi> right to convene such Courts; but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard pointed to the argument of
								<persRef ref="randall-thomas">Captain Randall</persRef>, Smith’s
							Counsel, that the Commander of the Marine Corps, having only the rank of
							Lieutenant-Colonel, could not convene a general Court-Martial, the 65<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of War giving the power only to
							any general officer commanding an army or <hi rend="italic">Colonel
							</hi>commanding a separate Department—but I thought the term Colonel in
							the Article, as it does in common parlance, included Lieutenant
							Colonels, in which construction M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							concurred with me. Finally M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard took
							my draft as it was to the Department, and sent me a copy of it which I
							signed. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> came to enquire for a Letter from <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">General P. B. Porter</persRef>, which I had
							already sent back to the Department. <persRef ref="dobbin-robert"
								>Dobbin</persRef> was a young man from Baltimore, and <persRef
								ref="meeteer-george">Meeteer</persRef> from Bucks County,
							Pennsylvania who visited me merely from curiosity. <persRef
								ref="harrison-gustavus">Captain Harrison</persRef> came for a
							decision in his case, which from a claim for pay while he was dismissed
							from the service, has changed to the demand of a per diem allowance
							while he was here, settling his Accounts— I told him I should refer this
							to the Secretary of the Treasury and accordingly gave the papers to
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> to decide upon them— He had already rejected the
							claim for pay— A Cabinet Meeting attended by Mess<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs.</hi><persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, Rush and
							Southard, considered the draft of a Letter of Instruction to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, prepared by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							upon the British interdiction of our shipping in their West-India
							Colonies— It is a thorough refutation of the false pretences, and a keen
							retort upon the sarcastic insolence of <persRef ref="canning-george"
								>Canning’s</persRef> Note. There was not much discussion of it, and
							it was not read— There were in one or two passages concessions of a
							right in Great Britain to ordain this interdiction, and to refuse
							negotiation concerning it— I thought they had better be omitted, the
							right of interdicting commerce being questionable when applied
							exclusively to one Nation, and that of refusing Negotiation, scarcely
							being maintainable after a formal and positive promise to negotiate— I
							thought also there should be some enlargement of remark, upon the
							discrimination made in British Acts of Parliament in their conditions
							upon the admission of shipping, between Nations having Colonies and
							Nations having none— The latter designation applying in its practical
							operation almost exclusively to the United States, and being only a
							covert mode of establishing regulations, peculiarly adverse to them—
							There was question whether a Proclamation of retaliatory interdict of
							British shipping from the Colonies should not be issued under the act of
							Congress of 1. March 1823. but as this measure cannot with propriety be
							taken, until we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that the British interdict
							has taken effect, and it commences only from the first of December, we
							thought it best to refer the whole subject to Congress— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s note said among other things, that
							it would not be proper to communicate to the British Government the
							purport of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s instructions
							relating to the colonial trade— Yet he proposed that they should be sent
							to Congress with the Message— I asked whether this would not appear
							inconsistent. He said the question had occurred to himself— But he
							thought a direct communication of them to the British Government, would
							seem like an entreaty to them to resume the Negotiation though they have
							declared they will not negotiate— But with the Message to Congress, it
							will go only as information to our own <pb type="ms" n="112"
							/>Countrymen, and if the British Government obtain it thus indirectly,
							it will be without impropriety, or debasement on our part— There were
							some nettles scattered through the Note which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay pointed out for consideration— I said I wished them all
							to remain; for after flooring M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							upon his Logic, it was well to give him also some return for his gibes—
							After this object of the meeting was gone through, mention was made by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, of my proposal for recommending
							to Congress again a loan at 4 1/2 or 5 per Cent, redeemable in 1829 and
							1830. to redeem the six per Cent Stocks now or immediately becoming
							redeemable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought that the name of
							a loan would be liable to a misrepresentation, as if it was to increase
							instead of diminishing the debt; but such a misrepresentation would be
							so easily refuted that it ought not to stand in the way of a measure of
							real economy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush will pursue the
							subject farther. <persRef ref="alberti-edwin">Lieutenant
								Alberti</persRef> called here this evening to urge an immediate
							decision in his case, as he was desirous of leaving the City on Monday—
							I told him I had the decision already prepared, and mentioned what it
							was— I said if he would call on <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher"
								>Major Vandeventer</persRef> and ask him to come to me this Evening
							or to-morrow Morning I would give him the remission and the Papers, so
							that he, Alberti need not be detained in the City over Monday— I also
							told him that it had not been my intention to reverse the decision upon
							the Sentence of the Court Martial, by <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef>, but merely to remit the unexecuted part of
							the penalty— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> and
							my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> went this morning to
							Rockville— John returned this evening— I wrote again till near
							Midnight.</p>

								Alberti</persRef>, which I gave him— He said he would bring me
							to-morrow the Reports and Statements from the War Department, necessary
							for the preparation of the Message— <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef> had remitted one Month of the Suspension
							from Rank, pay and emoluments which the Court-Martial had fixed for
							twelve months from the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last
							February the date of their Sentence— He had offered to remit further the
							suspension from the first of this month— Lieutenant Alberti, appealed
							both from the Sentence of the Court-Martial, and from the decision of
							General Scott, to the War Department and it thus came to me. Without
							reversing either the Sentence of the Court, or the decision of General
							Scott, I remitted the remainder of the suspension from rank, and the
							whole suspension of pay and emoluments— The prosecution was malicious. I
							heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef> this morning, from Luke 7:16. “And there came a
							fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, that a great prophet is
							risen up among us; and that God hath visited his people.” It was
							something between a Discourse, and a Speech in defence of the Miracles,
							recorded in the Scriptures: partly read from his Notes, and partly
							extemporaneous commentary— But this is not the manner in which <hi
								rend="italic">that</hi> subject ought to be treated— The miracles of
							the New Testament appear to have been performed, as evidences of the
							divine Mission of Christ— Faith was to be founded on the mighty works by
							which it was authenticated: but now the order of proof is reversed— It
							is the doctrine of the Scriptures alone that can obtain credence for the
							miracles— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little read several extracts
							from a Dudleian Lecture of <persRef ref="channing-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing’s</persRef> upon this
							subject, with great commendation— They were very ingenious and eloquent,
							but the drift of them was to prove that there is no reason for
							disbelieving the scriptural accounts of Miracles, or that the Creator
							should bind himself to exclusive operation by general Laws— This is very
							true, but it does not meet the question; which is not upon the power of
							the creator, but upon the fact of the miracle— The miracles in the
							Bible, furnish the most powerful of all the objections, against its
							authenticity, both historical and doctrinal—and were it possible to take
							its sublime morals, its unparalleled conceptions of the nature of God
							and its irresistible power over the heart, with the simple narrative of
							the life and death of Jesus, strip’d of all the supernatural agency, and
							all the marvellous incidents connected with it, I should receive it
							without any of those misgivings of unwilling incredulity as to the
							miracles which I find <pb type="ms" n="113"/>it impossible altogether to
							cast off. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little had not respect enough
							for his text; after the service I called to see <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> who is slowly
							convalescent from his fever. Much better than last Sunday, but still
							feeble— He said he had rode this morning four or five miles on
							horseback— He had on his table the Newspapers of the Northern Mail; with
							some returns of the recent Election in New-York, which he thought
							unfavourable— He also read me an extract of a Letter from <persRef

								Rochester</persRef>, has been set up as a Candidate for Governor

							Purser in the Navy; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had
							given him some expectation of success— But Captain <unclear>. . .</unclear> mentioned to

							days after Spafford, brought to Southard an anonymous Letter, purporting
							to be to Spafford; warning him that he had an enemy at the Department,
							and the writer pretending to have overheard at the Navy Department a

							Berrien writes a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard,

							answer that from similarity of hand-writing he had entertained suspicion
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spafford wrote the anonymous Letter

							knew the author of the anonymous Letter, and promised to inform him who
							it was; which he still might do—and that it was not the only cause of

							Nor had I seen it— He said it was now before <persRef ref="brown-jacob"
								>General Brown</persRef>, for revision— The General himself came in
							while Phillips was with me— The Lieutenant called on me again, and I
							promised when I should see the papers of his case, to consider of what

							Election in New-York, where <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton</persRef> is rechosen
							Governor, but by a majority of not more hundreds than he had of
							thousands, at the last Election two years since— It is somewhat amazing
							to me, that a man, having no more hold upon life than he, should take
							such deep interest in mere election incidents— He said that the State of
							New-York, was in the hands of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van
								Buren</persRef>; that <pb type="ms" n="118"/>he would certainly be
							re-elected to the U.S. Senate— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton would be at his mercy, and he did not know what the consequence
							would be— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney came with a Letter
							from <persRef ref="randolph-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas Mann Randolph Sen<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> in
							answer to one from <persRef ref="barbour-james">Gov<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barbour</persRef>, offering him an

							between Georgia and Florida— He postpones his acceptance of the
							appointment to ask sundry questions—and for Instructions— I said it
							would be sufficient to give him general Instructions, leaving all the
							details, to be concerted with the Commissioner of the State of Georgia,
							at his discretion— As the act of Congress authorises also the
							appointment of a Surveyor, I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Kenney to enquire of Governor Barbour, if he had fixed upon any person
							to recommend— I spoke also of the Choctaw School funds, and requested
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney to send me the papers from
							the Department which would shew what had been already done upon the
							subject— He spoke of the School which has been established in Kentuckey,
							by their own determination, and which will require the application of
							the Capital of the fund— The papers were afterwards sent to me— <persRef
								ref="lee-henry3">H. Lee</persRef> came to ask me to return some
							manuscript Letters of <persRef ref="washington-george">General
								Washington</persRef>, which he had lent me I believe a year ago— I

							them up and return them soon. I returned to him another bundle of
							Letters which the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster
								General</persRef> had given me, concerning Lee himself. Lee’s
							reputation is bad with regard to private morals, and his political
							course is unprincipled—but he writes with great force and elegance, and
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> has used him for that purpose— Through Calhoun’s
							influence the Postmaster General gave Lee some small office in that
							Department, where it is said he has used the advantages of the
							situation, against the Administration, and to promote the purposes of
							his patron: while he has at the same time been constantly writing
							abusive pieces, for the Newspaper called the Telegraph, the Phoenix from
							the ashes of the Washington City Gazette— In the first half year, after
							I came into Office, I received a number of anonymous Letters, apparently
							from various quarters of the Union, but I believe all written in this
							City, charging Lee with these things, and the Postmaster General, with
							being accessory to them— I spoke of them two or three times to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean, who declared them calumnious as
							respected himself, and that he believed them so, as regarded M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee— He also sent me these Letters as
							recommendatory of Lee, among which was one from <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, curious, as containing some interesting remarks
							on the Declaration of Independence— Lee now told me that he had
							withdrawn from that place in the Post-Office, which he had only taken
							because he had been solicited to accept it— That he should offer himself
							as a Candidate for Congress, in Virginia and that he regretted I had
							been troubled on account of the place he had held in the Post-Office— He
							also recommended a son of one of his friends in Virginia, for a
							Midshipman’s warrant, and asked me to give him my signature in writing,
							and if I had them to spare, one of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								fathers</persRef> and of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi

							not view the Election in the State of New-York, in the same light with

								Wertz</persRef> came again for his Commission as a Justice of the

							ask them to make out and send me a Commission for him I would sign it—
							He expressed much gratitude for this and assured me, that I should never
							have occasion from any misconduct of his to regret my determination in
							his favour. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> afterwards came over, and I desired him to have the
							commission made out. <persRef ref="palacios-leandro">M<hi

							came with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent to take leave, being
							about to embark at New-York for Rio de Janeiro, where he goes with an
							appointment of Minister Plenipotentiary to the Government of Brazil. He
							appears to be and is in bad health, and said this Climate was too cold
							for his Constitution. <persRef ref="wallace-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace</persRef> was here, as voluble
							and scientific in his conversation as ever— He said he was just
							recovering from a dropsy. He discoursed upon entomology—the wonderful
							transformations of insects, and the voracious properties of the
							dragon-fly, and lion-ant, or formicales, the same animal under different
							forms— He spoke of its aquatic terrestrial, and aerial successive states
							of existence, as illustrative of the condition of man; and he repeated
							what he had said to me before, that my fresh water baths in the Summer,
							were injurious to my health; affecting as he said the liver— He
							attempted some demonstration about the absorption of vital air in the
							water upon the viscera, which I neither understood nor believed; but he
							admitted that bathing in Salt-water was wholesome, because he said there
							was more oxygen in Sea than in river water— His conversation is
							entertaining, ingenious and learned, but abounding in fanciful theory,
							and over confident in matters upon which the only safe process of the
							mind would be doubt— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> came, and asked my
							opinion of a second Letter which he had received from <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien</persRef>
							the Georgia Senator concerning the anonymous Letter to <persRef ref="u"
								>Spafford</persRef>— With it M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien,
							had enclosed a Letter from <persRef ref="tennison-joshua"
								>Tennison</persRef> the tavern keeper and <persRef ref="u">his
								son</persRef>, and a certificate from a <persRef ref="u">Major
								Denney</persRef>, from which it appears that the anonymous Letter,
							had been concerted between them and <hi rend="italic">another</hi>,
							dictated by Tennison the father, and written by the Son— But the reason
							for writing it, is very lamely accounted for, the artifice of sending it
							to Alexandria, that it might come Post-marked from that place, the
							mystery of describing it under the denomination of <hi rend="italic"
								>another</hi>, the fourth associate in the stratagem, and the
							acknowledgment of eaves-dropping at Navy-Department, are all
							circumstances little adapted to remove suspicions that Spafford had some
							agency in the transaction, being at the time, a boarder at Tennison’s
							house— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien professes now to have no
							other interest in this matter, than to justify his own recommendation of
							Spafford. I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard to see M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien, and to explain to him in
							conversation the grounds of suspicion still existing, but with full
							assurances that not the remotest idea was entertained, that he had
							knowledge of any thing unfavourable to the character of Spafford, when
							he recommended him— I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard <persRef ref="lee-henry3">H. Lee’s</persRef> recommendation of
							a youth named <persRef ref="brown-james2">Brown</persRef>, for a
							Midshipman’s Warrant— He said that he had been obliged to withstand
								<persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taliaferro’s</persRef> solicitations for the same person; and that
							now if he should yield to Lee’s application, Lee would abuse the favour
							in two ways—first by making a handle of it to detach the boy’s father
							from the Administration, to which he is now friendly; and secondly to
							boast of it as a proof that he had influence to obtain here, that which
							had been denied to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro. I told
							Southard that Lee had informed me he should offer himself as a Candidate
							for Congress— Southard said he was glad of it, for it would be against
							Taliaferro, and would tend to ensure his election. He said that Lee was
							under such obligations to Taliaferro that he was the last man in the
							world whom he ought to oppose; but he thought Lee’s profligacy at least
							equal to his talents— My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>

								Little</persRef> this morning from Haggai. 1.7. “Thus saith the Lord
							of Hosts; Consider your ways.” He gave an historical account of this
							prophet, and of the occasion upon which his prophecy was written— To
							urge the building of the second Temple—and he attributed to State policy
							the motives of the Medo-Persian Empire, for shewing favour to the Jews;
							supposing it to have been occasioned by jealousy of the rising power of
							the Grecian Republics. But the principal part of the discourse consisted
							in the application of the prophetical admonition to our own times and to
							the auditory of the preacher— After the morning service I had a visit
							from <persRef ref="hagner-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Hagner</persRef>, the third Auditor. He has just returned from his

							to a widow woman— But before the trial was to come on, and before M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner reached Raleigh the man had died in
							prison— In the afternoon I heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from Psalm 149.2.—
							“Let the children of Zion, be joyful in their King,” a text not
							altogether congenial to the Calvinistic creed; or to the topics usually
							pressed by preachers of the Presbyterian Church— It was upon the
							enjoyments of religion— In the Evening I resumed the draft of the annual
							message, and the reading of papers from the Departments preparatory for
							it— My papers for reading accumulate.</p>

							reason to expect that the answer of the Sultan, with respect to the
							negotiation of a commercial Treaty would be satisfactory. The Greek war,
							and the convulsive state of affairs at Constantinople, are however still
							formidable obstacles to the conclusion of a Treaty— I spoke to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard concerning the state of the Navy
							Department, and enquired if the annual half million of Dollars
							appropriated for the gradual increase of the Navy would not cease, this
							year, he said he believed it would. I asked it if would be sufficient to
							complete the equipments of the Ships of the Line, and Frigates, provided
							to be built by the Act of 29. April 1816. He thought it would, but that
							it was very desirable the appropriation should be continued, at least
							for the purpose of procuring a supply of Timber, but he said he would
							obtain a more particular Statement from the Commissioners of the Navy—

								ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef> of Georgia, who has
							succeeded in the State Elections, having a majority in both houses of

							reasonable, is less blustering than some of his former Epistles. I asked
							Governor Barbour, if there were not some Indian Treaties to be laid
							before the Senate at their next Meeting— He said there were, and they
							would be sent over to me to-morrow— <persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi

						<p>When I walked out the eastern horizon was perfectly clear, and it so
							continued until a few minutes before sun rise; when a cloud formed
							itself at the border of the horizon, precisely where the Sun was to
							rise, and seemed like a curtain suddenly drawn before him, to veil him
							from sight as he rose. The Sky above continued clear. I have several
							times observed before the same phenomenon, which may be described as the
							Sun’s rising, veiled. Whenever I mark in this Diary the time of the
							Sun’s rising, it is from my own observation, with a clear sky— <persRef

							called to enquire, if I had received several bronze medals, and books

							his friends, and gave him one of <persRef ref="furst-moritz"
								>Fürst’s</persRef> medals, which I desired him to present to them in
							my name. <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kenney</persRef> came upon the subject of the Choctaw fifty-four

							came, and I told him that before acting further in the matter, I wanted
							an additional Statement from <persRef ref="graham-george">the
								Commissioner of the general Land-Office</persRef>; shewing not only
							the sums received on the Sales of the Lands, but the portions of the
							fifty-four Sections which had been sold— He said he would procure it— He
							also read to me the draft of the Report, which he was about making to
							the Secretary of War, of the Transactions of this year in the Indian
							Department— <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliot</persRef>
							came to enquire if I had any copy of the proceedings of the

							the Federal Constitution in 1787. or whether they were not among
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Books— They are not—

							that extracts from the recent despatches of our naval Commanders in the
							Pacific Ocean, upon the Coast of Brazil, on the West-India Station, and
							in the Mediterranean should be copied, to be communicated to Congress
							with the Message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard promised me

							not impracticable— I am wading through another Court-martial volume of
							nearly two hundred pages, upon a <persRef ref="babcock-samuel">Major
								Babcock</persRef>—dismissed from the Service, and recommended by the

							of 12 and 5. Pecan nuts, and one row of 12. Pig nuts. This will be the
							last of my Plantations for the present Autumn— Perhaps I should reserve

								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							confidential friend both of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>, and of General Brown— The Letter speaks only in
							the name of the writer, but General Brown supposes it to have been
							written with the knowledge of Clinton, and considers it as indicating a
							determination of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton to support
							actively the Administration of the General Government. His conduct
							towards it hitherto has been of a cold, reserved neutrality, “willing to
							wound and yet afraid to strike.” Two years since he was elected Governor
							of New-York, by a majority of upwards of 16000 votes— This majority at
							the recent Election has dwindled down to less than 3000. It is said
							there is a majority in both Houses of the Legislature <pb type="ms"
								n="125"/>elected of his opponents— There is no prospect that the

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer’s Letter, is equivalent to an

							upon the friends of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton in the House
							of Representatives from New-York, and he recommends a conciliatory
							course towards them; a conciliatory course, so far as may be compatible

							Superior Power that I should pass through, it is my duty to link myself
							to the fortunes of no man— In the balance of Politics, it is seldom wise

						<p><persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> called early this
							morning and had a long conversation with me, on the subject of his
							friend <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Spencer’s</persRef> Letter. He
							said he considered it as a decisive proof that <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clinton</persRef> had rejected all coalition with <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, and that he had determined to connect all his
							future prospects, with a frank and cordial support of the
							Administration— I said that my conduct towards M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clinton had been invariably friendly— That his to me had
							been cold, distant, and reserved. Sometimes not altogether fair, perhaps
							positively unfriendly. I should not vary my course towards him. His to
							me was before him, at his own option— As to the succession after me, I
							should observe as far as possible a neutral course, which was that
							pursued as long and as far as he was able by <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> during his
							Administration. If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s wish was to
							conciliate the friends of the present Administration, I presumed it
							would not be by arraying himself against it— If he depended, for his
							future advancement upon its enemies, I thought little of his prospects
							of success— Without meeting the point which was obviously the object of
							the General’s visit, and of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencers
							Letter I passed in review the movements of personal parties during M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s administration, having reference
							to the succession— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef><persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef><persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef> and those of their respective
							friends and partizans— The forced introduction of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, and his humble
							pretensions, with the effects of all these combinations upon the conduct
							and neutrality of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe. My purpose in
							this was by shewing the tenaciousness with which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe adhered to his neutral system, and the departures
							from it which circumstances forced upon him, to convince General Brown,
							that neutrality as to the succession was the proper policy of a
							President in Office, although it might not always be possible for him to
							maintain it— This is at once an overture, and a menace on the part of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton— Spencer’s Letter says M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren thinks there is in the New-York
							Delegation, recently elected, a majority against the administration—and
							then adds he must include among them the friends of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton— Now I understand entirely the
							drift of this insinuation, and must abide as I may the issue of the
							marches and countermarches of these worthies, leaving them altogether to
							themselves. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pottenger</persRef> came from <persRef ref="harrison-gustavus"
								>Captain Harrison</persRef> for my decision upon his claim; which I
							gave him to take to the Treasury Department— <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							came and introduced to me two episcopal Clergymen; one from Troy in
							New-York; the other named <persRef ref="u">Butler</persRef>, from
							Virginia. <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Wyer</persRef> came to apologise
							for his deshabillé, when he came to see me on his return from Russia.
								<persRef ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Scott</persRef>, the member of the House of Representatives from
							Missouri has just arrived to attend the approaching Session of Congress.
							He reminded me that I had said I should refer to Congress, the case of
								<persRef ref="bissell-daniel">General Bissell</persRef>, and said
							the General was desirous of being informed as soon as possible of the
							manner in which I should present it— I told him I should mention in the
							Message at the Commencement of the Session, that in consequence of a
							difference of opinion between the late President and the Senate, upon
							the Construction of the Act of Congress of March 1823 reducing the army,
							it had remained unexecuted so far as concerned the appointment of one
							Colonel, and <pb type="ms" n="126"/>and that a Supplementary or

								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Rush</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> were here;
							both convalescent from severe bilious fevers— I read to them the parts
							of the draft of a Message, which I had written, concerning the Affairs
							of the Treasury War, and Navy Departments, upon which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush made some remarks— Governor Barbour
							brought me the Reports from the <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">Quarter
								Master General</persRef> and from the Indian Office, and also two
							Indian Treaties to be laid before the Senate. He also read to me a paper
							which he had written for <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>, to be inserted in
							the National Intelligencer as a Communication, or under the Editorial
							head, being a defence of certain passages in my last years Message, upon
							which a continual fire is kept up in the Richmond Enquirer— The
							Governor’s intentions are kind and friendly, and a great part of his

							thought it best not to object to them— I received and answered a Letter

							Government, for nothing— He printed an Edition of this speech in a
							pamphlet, and Cook says he scattered copies of it all over the Country,
							as he went home; and now as he is returning to Congress— Cook says that
							the minds of the people upon this subject are all debauched, that they
							say they must have the lands for nothing, and that the debt they owe for
							those they have bought, must be spunged— He adds that Benton made
							himself amazingly popular by the Resolution he offered for graduating,
							and reducing the price of the Lands, though his popularity has been
							somewhat shaken, by a powerful exposure of him in the newspapers in the
							course of the Summer. I have no doubt however that he will be
							re-elected. Cook himself has prepared three Resolutions, much to the
							same purport; but I think under bidding even upon Benton— Cook is too
							late to save himself, but the best days of our Land sales are past— We
							shall have trouble from that quarter.</p>

								Elgar</persRef> the Commissioner of the Public Buildings came with a

							the title of two half-acres of Land, in Alexandria, which the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson</persRef> came to enquire of my
							decision upon his case— I had sent it to the war Department— He was
							cashiered by sentence of a Court-Martial for Embezzlement of public
							Stores, he claimed to be restored upon the allegation of gross
							partiality and oppression by the Court-martial <pb type="ms" n="128"
							/>against him—and he had produced a very ingenious and forcible argument
							of <persRef ref="randall-thomas">Captain Thomas Randall</persRef>, in
							support of his allegations— I told him I had no power to restore him,
							unless by a new nomination to the Senate; and I could not make that,
							without condemning unheard the Court-Martial by whom he had been tried—
							I have seldom felt my compassion more moved for a man than for him; whom
							though I cannot believe him innocent, I yet fear to have had hard
							measure dealt out to him. <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef>, the Secretary of the
							Senate called, and brought me the Executive Records of the Senate, for
							the last Session— A person named <persRef ref="u">Yates</persRef> came
							with the first Volume of <persRef ref="godman-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Godman’s</persRef> American Natural
							History. At Noon I rode up to the Capitol, and met <persRef
								ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Trumbull</persRef> in the Rotunda— His four pictures are placed, and
							in such a favourable light, that they appear far better than they had
							ever done before— There are four other spaces to be filled with pictures
							of the same size, for which the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> is
							very desirous of being employed. He had therefore placed under them, his
							small pictures of the Deaths of <persRef ref="warren-joseph2"
								>Warren</persRef> &amp; <persRef ref="montgomery-richard"
								>Montgomery</persRef>, and two others from sketches, one of the
							Death of <persRef ref="mercer-hugh">Mercer</persRef> at Princeton, and
							the fourth another Battle, and with them he had brought two small
							pictures, for churches, religious subjects which he said he had painted
							this present year, and had taken here with him to shew that he was not
							too old to paint yet. A French workman in Sculpture engaged upon a
							Bas-relief of Penn’s Treaty, came and asked me to go up on his
							scaffolding and view his work which I did— But all the Bas-reliefs in
							the Rotundo are execrably bad— I went up likewise within the scaffolding
							to the Pediment, where <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>
							was at work. One of his three figures is nearly finished, and I think
							the design when completed will be good. I met <persRef
								ref="varnum-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Varnum</persRef>
							the member of the house from Massachusetts— From the Capitol, <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> went with me, to the spot where they are building
							the Penitentiary, which I was pleased to find had the walls raised
							higher than the second row of windows— <persRef ref="u">Lackie</persRef>
							the Superintendent of the work was there— After viewing this work, I
							took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch to his house, and then came
							home, just at three— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> came in immediately afterwards—and brought me his
							own Report preparatory to the Message, and also the rough sketch of the
							Report to him of the board of army and militia Officers, whom he
							assembled here to prepare a system of Artillery Instruction, and of
							cavalry tactics— Governor Barbour wished me to say something of their
							Militia plan in the Message. He promised to come at eleven to-morrow; to
							hear the first reading of the Message, and he renewed the suggestion
							which had been made by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, of a wish that the Heads of Departments
							should examine it, by themselves, to which I agreed— <persRef

							objection that can be made, by every member of the administration— But
							it has never been practised heretofore, and I am not sure that it will
							be <pb type="ms" n="129"/>a safe precedent to follow— In England where
							the Speech or Message is delivered by a person under no responsibility,

								<persRef ref="randall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Randall</persRef>, Todson’s Counsel; who was fully convinced it was
							no idle threat of Todson’s, but what he would Attempt to execute— He

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Trumbull</persRef> brought and left
							here a large Port-Folio, containing four engravings from pictures
							painted by him— The Battle of Bunker’s Hill, the Death of <persRef
								ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef>, the Declaration of
							Independence, and the Sortie at Gibraltar, and inscribed on the outside
							of the Port-Folio, as presented by him to the President of the United
							States 1826. All the members of the Administration came about one
							O’Clock, having discussed together the draft of the annual message:
							which they brought back, having marked several passages, which they
							thought it would be expedient to strike out or to alter— I did
							accordingly strike out, or alter them with one exception of little
							importance— I had prepared and read an additional paragraph, to
							accompany the Report of the Board of Engineers upon the Chesapeake and
							Ohio Canal. At the close of this paragraph, I had introduced a most
							earnest, and emphatic recommendation of it to Congress— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> said
							that he entertained opinions upon that subject, which he was almost
							afraid to express—he did however express them, and they were of the most
							decisive character against the whole project— He thought notwithstanding
							the Report of the Board of Engineers that its practicability was
							doubtful— He believed that at all Events, its cost would rather exceed
							than fall short of the Estimates of the Board, twenty-two Millions of
							Dollars, and when accomplished he believed it would be comparatively
							speaking of small utility— It would not divert the great mass of the
							trade of the Western Country from New-York and Philadelphia— It would be
								<pb type="ms" n="130"/>of very little service to this City, although
							the people here expected so much from it; and with the exception of the
							small district of Country closely bordering on the line through which
							the Canal must pass, there was very little interest felt in it any
							where; and none at all in the Western Country generally. <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> coincided much with
							these views of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and superadded to
							them a much stronger doubt of the practicability of the undertaking,
							founded upon an opinion expressed by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							contested these opinions, which are diametrically opposite to those
							urged with great force in the Report of the Board of Engineers, from
							which I read several passages setting forth in lively colours the great
							importance of the work— Still inclining to the same belief, I concluded
							however, as there was so much diversity of sentiment in the Cabinet, to
							leave the Report of the Board of Engineers, to stand upon its own
							strength, and struck out the whole recommendatory part of the paragraph—
							Governor Barbour enquired if I had prepared a paragraph upon the Report
							of the Board of Officers, proposing a new organization of the Militia— I
							had not; and I said that upon examining the Report, I had not been
							altogether satisfied that the project proposed by the Board would be
							expedient; and still less, that it would be approved in Congress— The
							part of it which provided for reducing the numbers and the term of
							Militia-service, I thought good, and likely to prove acceptable—but the
							application of two or three hundred thousand dollars a year, for paying
							militia-Officers to receive Instruction, was in my mind of doubtful
							policy, and not likely to obtain favour in Congress. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour said he had abstained from any
							recommendation of the plan of the Board himself, and did not wish for
							any in the Message. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay spoke of the
							application by <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Johnston</persRef> of Louisiana, for a recommendation of
							measures for the Settlement of Land titles in the purchased Territories;
							and said <persRef ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Scott</persRef> of Missouri, had some projects about which he had
							conversed with him, but which he did not approve— It was near five when
							the Members of the Administration withdrew— Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Randall had called upon me, and confirmed the intimations
							given me before by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt— He said Todson
							had avowed to him his determination to assassinate me; and that he
							believed it was no idle menace— That the man was desperate, and upon
							this subject perfectly mad. That he fancied he should redeem his
							character by Revenge— That he represented himself as the victim of a
							party combination against him, and that I had lent myself to it— That he
							considered his own innocence of the charges of which he was convicted by
							the Court Martial to be so clear and palpable; that no impartial person
							could possibly doubt it, and that I had shewn I had joined the
							conspiracy against him by refusing to give him <persRef
								ref="dubourg-louis">Bishop DuBourg’s</persRef> Letter to <hi
								rend="italic">me</hi>, in his favour— Randall said he was convinced
							Todson would make the attempt; for he was a man who would do more than
							he would say— That he had said every thing in his power to dissuade him
							from his purpose, and had felt himself bound to give me this notice,
							lest possibly Todson might take the opportunity to perpetrate the deed,
							in one of my morning walks— I thanked Randall for his communication, and
							said that in Todson’s case I had discharged a painful, but an
							indispensable duty— I could not disapprove, or reverse the decision of
							the Court Martial against him, upon his mere allegation of their
							partiality— As to Bishop DuBourg’s Letter, it was addressed to me; and
							Todson had no right to ask me for it— But the simple truth was that when
							he asked for it, I could not find it; perhaps it had been sent to the
							War Department; but it could not be necessary for Todson, for he had
							among his papers, another Letter from the Bishop to the same effect— I
							added that it was impossible for me to guard myself against the hand of
							an Assassin, but I was nevertheless obliged to him for his information—
							He said he should see Todson again this day, and would let me know, if
							any thing further should occur to require it. He said Todson declared to
							him that he did not intend to fly, but would take his revenge, thus
							redeem his character, and abide by the consequences— Randall is a
							phrenologist, and with the utmost seriousness avowed that his
							apprehensions arose in part from Todson’s having a most extraordinary
							organ of destructiveness— The tendency of this observation was to throw
							an aspect of ridicule upon the whole affair— But Randall is a man of
							great firmness and intrepidity, and has no motive in this disclosure,
							but of friendly concern for me; and to relieve himself from all
							responsibility of being privy to the purpose of this desperate man,
							without putting me upon my guard against him— I am in the hands of a
							higher Power.</p>
