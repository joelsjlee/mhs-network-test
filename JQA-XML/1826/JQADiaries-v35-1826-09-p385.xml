						<p><persRef ref="riley-james">Captain Riley</persRef> was here and shewed me
							Letters from two of his friends in Connecticut, expressing the wish that
							in the expected vacancy of the Collector’s Office at Middletown, he
							might receive the appointment. Captain Riley has formed a Settlement at
							the Western corner of the State of Ohio, which has been partially
							successful, but his health has not resisted the climate, and he is
							obliged to pass the latter summer and first autumnal Months North of his
							Residence— <persRef ref="french-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								French</persRef> surveyed last Winter two of the Woodlots, belonging
							to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate, excepting a
							small part of the line, which he this day finished. The survey of it by
								<persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Withington</persRef> thus became unnecessary— The appraisers also
							went this day upon all the woodlots and I accompanied them— <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">My brother’s</persRef> two youngest Sons,
								<persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="farrar-isaac">Farrar</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pote-william"
								>William P<unclear>ot</unclear>e</persRef> formed our party. My brother found himself
							so stiffened by the labour of the last, two days that he did not go. The
							weather was unpromising when we started; about 9. O’Clock. and it came
							on to rain just as we entered the woods for about two hours. It
							afterwards held up, and for the remainder of the day was cool and
							cloudy. The Sun shortly before setting came out clear— While the rain
							continued our work was uncomfortable— The rest of the day less Laborious
							than the two preceding— We dined at the same spot we had chosen the day
							before yesterday, and as we came out by the Railway and Bunker-Hill
							Ledges, we saw the workmen letting down two Monument Stones, weighing
							each upwards of two Tons— I continued my search for leaves and plants,
							attending more particularly this day to the Maples— The practice of
							cutting off the wood from these forests every fifteen or twenty years
							has so stunted them, that covered as they are with a beautiful growth of
							Oaks, it was with much difficulty that I obtained half a dozen twigs of
							black and white Oaks with young Acorns upon them—</p>
						<p><unclear>I gathered a few Poke berries of the juice of which here is a specimen—
							<persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bigelow’s</persRef> American Botany, Vol. 1.
							p. 39. calls this Phytolacca Decandra—and besides the name of Poke says
							it is in New-England more frequently called Garget, Cocum-Jalep, and
							Pigeon Berries— But he says this bright purple will in a very short time disappear.</unclear></p>
						<p>I gathered also a few seeds of the Sugar maple— We saw one black Oak
							shrub nearly stripped of its leaves by a multitude of dark coloured
							worms about an inch long, of which without intending it, we brought a
							half a dozen home, upon a twig from another tree. I placed three of them
							under one of my glasses, to observe so long as I may have time their
							habits and if possible their changes. We found by information from
								<persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef> that <persRef
								ref="u">Harmon</persRef> the day before yesterday made another
							mistake in the lines and included a lot belonging to his brother
								<persRef ref="harmon-thomas">Thomas</persRef> in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington’s Survey. Farrar is to go to
							morrow Morning and give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington notice

						<p>The appraisers of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate,
							this day finished their view of the landed property— They first went
							down upon the Salt Marshes which occupied them until dinner time— After
							which they closed with the farm, round the house— I did not accompany
							them: being already acquainted with the places they have visited— My Son
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> returned this morning from
							Boston, and between twelve and one O’Clock we bathed at the wharf. I
							swam about half an hour— <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My
								brother’s</persRef> youngest Son, <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph
								H.</persRef> came down and bathed while we were there— He has learnt
							to swim perfectly, and now only needs practice— I went and dined with
							General <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">H. A. S. Dearborn</persRef> at
							Brinley Place in    On the way, I stopped at the Railway tavern, and saw
							the notice posted up in the bar room, signed by myself and <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							of our appointment as Executors of my father’s Will— It was already
							partly detached from the side of the Bar-room, and I reposted it myself—
							At General Dearborn’s the company consisted of <persRef

								ref="dearborn-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Dearborn</persRef> was the <unclear>only</unclear> Lady at table— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce spoke to me of the remains of my
							father’s maternal family at Brookline— Boylston’s, and White’s, and of
							the antient family Estate in that Town, which has gone into other hands—
							Sir Isaac Coffin is an Admiral in The British Service; but a native of
							Boston, for which place he retains strong attachments. He spoke of his
							having once been upon a whaling voyage from Liverpool— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor spoke to me after dinner upon
							Politics, and the electioneering fermentation in the State of New-York.
							He speaks with much bitterness of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton</persRef>, who he thinks is
							intriguing to supplant the Administration, and who he says has taken
							unwearied pains to get up an opposition to his, Taylor’s re-election in
							his district Taylor is however sangwine of his own re-election, and
							inclines to the opinion, that Clinton will supplant no one unless it
							should be himself. New-York is however utterly uncertain, and my only
							course is to prepare for retirement, as I hope I am now doing— It was
							about 9 in the Evening which I reached home, and I found <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> had returned from
							Boston, with <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J.

								Greenleaf</persRef> paid an Evening visit— Meeting <persRef

								Greenleaf</persRef> after this Morning’s service, I spoke to him
							about the building of the Temple, to cover part of the expence of which,
							my father made a donation to the Town— They have made no advances to it
							since the Meeting of the Trustees immediately after my arrival here— I
							told him I would write a Letter to the Trustees of the Donation, stating
							to them my wishes with regard to the erection of the Temple, and that a
							vault might be constructed in which the remains of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and mother may be entombed, and
							a marble tablet with a monumental inscription, upon one side of the Wall
							of the edifice— I also told him that I should be glad to have some
							written agreement with the Trustees or with the Inhabitants of the Town,
							upon the subject. He said if I would write, there might be called a
							meeting of the Inhabitants of the Town, who he believed would be willing
							to begin the building of the Temple very shortly. I owe it to the memory
							of my father and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> not to
							forget or neglect this affair, and I pray that I may have perseverance
							and a Spirit of devotion to it, that it may be accomplished before I
							myself go hence to be here no more. And should Providence in wisdom have
							decreed otherwise, I leave it in charge to my children, and exhort them
							to untiring Industry, and inflexible frugality that instead of
							squandering their means in extravagance and idleness, they may have to
							spare from their wants a tribute of reverence to their forefathers.</p>

							Will that there were two lots of Woodland, given by it to my father, one

							to the Appraisers, who were assembled at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>;
							and found by the plans of Surveys, that the lots had been taken; but
							that there appeared still to be an error in the Survey of one of the
							lots, and a deficiency of at least five Acres of land— I determined to
							make further enquiries; but as the inventory must be returned to the
							Court of Probate to-morrow, the Appraisers made up their Report, upon
							the property as yet discovered, and to make a Supplementary Report,
							should any thing further be found.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Daniel Greenleaf, brought me this Evening the Inventory, signed by the
							three Appraisers— The whole Estate, real, personal, and mixed amounts to
							a trifle more than forty-three thousand dollars— I was very much
							perplexed, and wasted not a little time, this day by the loss of the
							minutes I had made of all the Deeds of Real Estate left by my father— A

							Executors, by posting and by publication in the Boston Independent
							Chronicle and Centinel Newspapers, and made Oath that it had been duly
							executed— I also returned the Inventory and Appraisement, signed by the
							three Appraisers; and before being sworn to the return, delivered to the
							judge a list of the Articles of wearing apparel, in use of my father to
							the time of his decease, which I told him had not been shewn to the
							Appraisers, there being a repugnance in the family that they should be
							exposed to sale, and it being supposed not customary to include such
							Articles in the Inventory. He said it would be sufficient to annex the
							list to the Inventory, and certify at the foot that those Articles were
							divided among the heirs; which I did— They consisted of old Clothing
							which I propose, giving to my brother, for him and his family: of a
							large Cornaline Seal of the Boylston Arms, slightly varied by him, which
							I have given to my brother; of a pair of gold Sleeve-buttons, which I

							and a gold Stock buckle, which I propose to take myself, giving an
							equivalent for it to <persRef ref="smith-john">John A. Smith</persRef>—
							The Cornaline Seal, with the Fishery Device he had directed <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> to give me, and his
							Silver Seal with his Cypher he had given to my Son John— I mentioned
							also to the judge the small tract of Land in Vermont, which he said need
							not be put into the inventory, but which he thought we might sell
							without the formality of taking out an Administration— I asked him if he
							had thought of the questions I had proposed to him respecting the
							conditional devises to me— He said he had no doubt my title would be
							valid; and he had consulted some of his legal friends who concurred in
							the opinion— I asked him whether the growing crop would be mine, or go
							to the Executors—he said it would be mine, as the Will required me to
							pay interest on the purchase from the time of the testator’s decease— I
							asked <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haven</persRef>
							the Register for a copy of the Inventory, which he promised to furnish

							Her daughter <persRef ref="tufts-susannah">Susan</persRef>, with
								<persRef ref="whitney-caroline">Caroline Whitney</persRef> had
							called this Morning to visit my wife— I returned from Weymouth over the
							Turnpike road; which having been opened within the last twenty years has
							none of those affecting associations of half a century’s memory, which
							every rock, and every tree upon the old Road carries with it— Some of
							those Recollections are very indistinct, and I was this Evening
							attempting to furbish them up by questions of <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Sampson</persRef>, but without much success— On returning home I
							found my Son John, who had come out from Boston, with <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef> of New-York:
							but they had come out only on a visit to the Ladies and immediately
							returned to Boston— My brother brought with him from Boston, a small
							Quarto volume, containing three very scarce early historical Books
							relating to New-England, <persRef ref="morton-thomas2"
								>Morton’s</persRef> New English Canaan 1637—<persRef
								ref="wood-william2">Wood’s</persRef> New England’s Prospect, 1639.
							And Wonder-working Providence—A History of New-England, from 1628 to
							1652 Printed in 1654. This book which has long been missing, was found
							at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster’s</persRef>, with some others left there by <persRef
								ref="shaw-william">W. S. Shaw</persRef>, and have remained there

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jedidiah Adams’s</persRef> to
							ask him again for the loan of the first Henry Adams’s Will— But he said
							it had never been returned to him. So that I must look for it among my
							father’s papers— We thence went and called upon <persRef
								ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Daniel Spear</persRef>, whom I informed of
							the Executor’s Advertisement of the intended Sale of my father’s Lands,
							and of the Household furniture and farming Stock, of which he is to be

							dollars for the Salt Hay standing on the Rock Island lot, which he paid
							me— One of my objects in calling upon him was to see <persRef
								ref="spear-polly">his wife</persRef>, whom I knew when we were both
							children, and whom I have scarcely seen to speak to since— Her name was
							Polly Belcher, daughter of <persRef ref="belcher-moses">Moses
								Belcher</persRef>, a man who often worked upon my fathers farm, and
							who lived in a house directly opposite to that in which I was born— She
							is one year older than I am, and is a very respectable woman— She lives
							in a part of the town, where I know not whether I have been this half
							century; which was then almost a desolation, but is now thrifty and
							flourishing. It comes out much to my surprize, upon the Braintree and
							Weymouth Turnpike, at the first Bridge— We proceeded thence through a
							Lane upon which was once a Cottage where <persRef ref="copeland-isaac"
								>Isaac Copeland</persRef> lived, and where I once in boyhood spent a
							Sunday. The House is gone, but I found the spot where it had been— In
							these rambles, I am continually reminded of the line “and loves his old
							cotemporary trees,” the force of which I feel the older I grow. We went
							to the house of <persRef ref="french-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							borrowed of him, the old Town-Records, which had been lent, three years
							since to my father by the then Town Clerk <persRef ref="wales-unknown"
								>Wales</persRef>, since dead— My father then had a copy of them
							made, which is however very imperfect, having been made by several
							hands— But the original is now in a much more mutilated condition than
							it was then— And it will probably soon be destroyed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> French lent it to me, and I spent much of
							the afternoon in comparing it with the copy— But these enquiries
							encroach too much upon my time— I asked <persRef ref="brooks-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> if the Hingham
							Church Records furnished the dates of the birth and marriage of <persRef

							constructed under it, in which the remains of my father and <persRef

								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							upon the subject of building the Temple; and he mentioned again the
							expediency of having in it an Apartment, to receive the Library, given
							by my father to the Town—which I approved— I informed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney also of my wish to join in
							Communion with the Church of which he is the Pastor— I ought to have
							joined it thirty years ago and more; but the tumult of the world, false
							shame, a distrust of my own worthiness to partake of the communion, and
							a residence elsewhere and continually changing made me defer it to a
							more convenient opportunity— But my fathers for nearly two Centuries
							have been members of this Church— My purpose is if my life should be
							spared till the end of my term of Public Service, to return and be
							gathered to my fathers here. It is right that I should make a public
							profession of my faith and hope as a Christian; and no time can be
							better for it than now immediately after the Death of my father and
							before my retirement from the public service, and the worldly cares of
							life. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney told me the next Communion
							day would be the first Sunday, which is the first day of next Month—
							That it was usual for the Minister to announce the intention of the
							communicant on the preceding Sunday, and that before administering the
							first communion he called upon the communicant, for a profession of
							faith in Christianity very short, and in general terms— He did this
							conforming to antient usage, but he had exceedingly abridged the
							profession of faith, from that used formerly by his Predecessor <persRef
								ref="wibird-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wibird</persRef>; and his own inclination was that it should hereafter
							be omitted altogether. The persons whose names are in the Margin were

								Isaac Smith</persRef> there— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> preached from Romans
							13.10. “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the

							received the early and latter rain.— Be ye also patient; stablish your

								ref="tufts-abigail">one</persRef> of whom married <persRef

							which are unknown to me. I told him that on seeing him in the pulpit
							this afternoon, I had been much struck with the remembrance that I had
							heard him preach on the same spot upwards of fifty years ago. It was
							just before he went to England, but he had no recollection of it. Upon
							examining this morning the papers sent by <persRef ref="felt-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt</persRef>, I found many of
							my own writing, which I had utterly forgotten; and a very few, of which

							my father and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>— They
							offered to call Meetings earlier if I should desire it, but as nothing
							effective can be done before my return to Washington, and as Individuals
							would be put to inconvenience by calling extraordinary Meetings, I
							agreed to leave the Subject to be decided at the regular Meetings— There
							are questions relating to property in this case, which require much
							consideration— I found and read to these Gentlemen some minutes in my
							father’s Journals of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1760. concerning
							this very question. I advised them to apply to the Legislature for an
							Act to incorporate them as Supervisors of the Adams Temple and School
							fund at Quincy, to which there appeared to be no objection on their
							part— Something was said of drafting a Petition for an Act of
							Incorporation, and a Bill, which deserves attention. My Son <persRef

							called here again this Morning, and spent an hour, having missed of the
							morning Stage to return to Boston— <persRef ref="dearborn-henry">General
								Dearborn</persRef> called for a visit, having recently returned from
							the State of Maine. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> was also here having
							been upon a like excursion to the extremity of that State— His health is
							improved. I told him all that had hitherto been done by me, towards the
							Execution of the Will of <persRef ref="adams-john">my Father</persRef>,
							to all which he assented. He said he would speak to the proprietors of
							the Railway, or some of them respecting the sale of the Lots of Land,
							through which they have passed— I also mentioned to him the disposal
							made of the wearing apparel, and the suggestion made by the <persRef
								ref="robbins-edward">judge of Probate</persRef>, that it would be
							proper he Quincy should also sign the paper relating to the distribution
							of it; which he said he would— After dinner I rode with my <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> to Hingham— We travelled by the
							old road, with which I was familiar when a child, but over which, from
							Weymouth I have not passed perhaps these forty years— We visited first,
								<persRef ref="thaxter-quincy">Quincy Thaxter</persRef> and his three
							daughters <persRef ref="thaxter-susannah">Susanna</persRef>,    and
								<persRef ref="thaxter-anna">Anna</persRef>; and in the same house
							the aged maiden <persRef ref="thaxter-celia">Celia</persRef>— The other
							Sister, <persRef ref="thaxter-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> who was
							living when I last came with my father in September 1823; soon after
							died— We called next at <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> the Ministers but he
							was not at home. We then went to <persRef ref="thaxter-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Thaxter’s</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="thaxter-edward">Edward Thaxter’s</persRef>, his Son,
							and there saw the two Ladies, Mother and daughter— After which we called
							at <persRef ref="loring-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Loring’s</persRef> where we saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								<persRef ref="loring-joanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Loring</persRef>, <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">their Son</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="whittemore-sophia">their daughter</persRef> with her
							husband <persRef ref="whittemore-nathaniel">Captain
							Whittemore</persRef>— The Thaxter’s are all descendents from <persRef
								ref="thaxter-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John
								Thaxter</persRef> who married <persRef ref="thaxter-anna2">Anna
								Quincy</persRef>, second daughter of my great-Grandfather <persRef
								ref="quincy-john">John Quincy</persRef>— I frequented the house much
							in my infancy, and was always treated with great kindness in it— At M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s we met M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brooks— We returned by the new roads over the Turnpikes and
							Bridges; newer and better Roads, but with other and far less interesting
							associated recollections. On reaching home I was relieved from much
							anxiety, by finding <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and both <persRef ref="adams-john2;adams-george"
								type="multi">my Sons</persRef> there. George much better than I had

							introducing <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thacher</persRef> of Plymouth; who is preparing for publication a

							Afterwards there came <persRef ref="basset-isaac">Isaac

								<persRef ref="robson-elizabeth">Elizabeth Robson</persRef>, whom I
							heard preach last Winter, at Washington, was here and very desirous of
							calling upon me, for which I appointed to-morrow Morning between 8 and
							9. O’Clock. I received a Letter from <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N.

						<p><persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> came this morning to

							the latter Sale were now prepared to be posted up in this Town; and also
							an Advertisement for the Sale of the Household furniture the Stock on
							the farm, the two Pews in the Meeting House, and the Tomb, which I
							determined should be on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 28<hi

							be necessary there should be a Clerk with him to keep an account of the
							Sales, and make out the Bills, and named <persRef ref="brackett-james"
								>Captain Bracket</persRef>, or <persRef ref="whitney-john">John
								Whitney</persRef>— I told him I would give him an answer upon this
							in a few days— <persRef ref="robson-elizabeth">Elizabeth
								Robson</persRef> the female Quaker preacher, with two other women
							and two men, came upon their Morning visit— <persRef ref="u"
								>Wistar</persRef> and one of the women are from Philadelphia— The
							other woman came from England with Elizabeth, and <persRef
								ref="basset-isaac">Bassett</persRef> is of Lynn. They are returning
							from a tour to Nantucket, and Elizabeth is now going to Montreal and
							Quebec. After the usual Salutations, Elizabeth sat some time with her
							hand covering her face as in deep meditation, and then addressed me in a
							formal religious exhortation of about a quarter of an hour concerning
							the cares and duties of the Ruler of a Nation, but particularly upon the
							condition of the poor, oppressed coloured people in this Country. after
							finishing her Address, and a short pause, she rose from the Sofa, turned
							and kneeled before it, and made a short prayer to God in my behalf— A
							short time after she had finished, the woman from Philadelphia made also
							a formal brief address; but in general terms and without reference to
							the Slaves— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> with his family
							were present. We heard them with respectful attention, and when they
							rose to withdraw, I thanked them for their exhortations and their
							prayers—observing that in the public trust with which I am charged, I
							had great need of the prayers of all worthy persons; and as to what
							Elizabeth had said concerning the condition of the poor coloured people
							in this Country, I should lay it seriously to heart and should act with
							a view to promote the glory of God, and the best interests of this great
							people. They then took leave— <persRef ref="miller-james">General
								Miller</persRef> came to solicit a Midshipman’s warrant for <persRef
								ref="miller-james2">his Son</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="burke-edmund2">Edmund Burke</persRef> for an appointment as
							Light-House keeper at Warwick Neck, Rhode Island, with Recommendations—
							My wife and <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went this
							afternoon to Nantasket Beach to stay till Friday; and I paid Evening
							visits to the <persRef ref="u">widow Miller</persRef> and to <persRef

							of an Act of incorporation of the Supervisors of the Temple and School

							said as the Railway itself was a project which if successful would be

							“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them”— After dinner I rode up
							to Braintree to hear <persRef ref="storrs-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef>, but was
							disappointed. He is absent, and a Stranger preached in his place from
							Matthew 25.30. “And cast ye the unprofitable servant into utter
							darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth”— The Quincy
							Church is the first, and the Braintree Church the second, established in
							the old Town of Braintree; and the two texts of the two preachers at
							them this day, selected from the same Gospel of Matthew, contain a
							complete summary of the opposite Doctrines which prevail in them.
							Arminian Unitarianism at Quincy— Trinitarian Calvinism at Braintree— The
							delivery of both the preachers was temperate, or rather cold. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Capens Discourse was plain, rational, and
							argumentative against infidelity. The Calvinist threatened eternal
							reprobation in so mild and even sluggish a manner that no small portion
							of his auditory slumbered over the precipice. I walked home, the
							distance being about three Miles and a half— I stopped on my way at the
							house of <persRef ref="field-joseph">Joseph Field</persRef>, next door
							to that in which I was born— He told me that he was 77 years old, and
							that there was now only one man older than himself in Quincy—<persRef
								ref="baxter-joseph">Joseph Baxter</persRef>— But he said his eldest
							Sister; <persRef ref="baxter-susannah">Susanna</persRef>, who married
								<persRef ref="baxter-jonathan">Jonathan Baxter</persRef>, and who as
								<persRef ref="field-abigail">his mother</persRef> told him, held me
							at the font, when I was baptized, was yet living, aged 83— I asked him
							many questions about his own family; his brothers, Sisters and Children,
							which he answered somewhat confusedly, and produced a book containing
							his own minutes of his own marriages and of the births marriages and
							deaths of his Children, and some few of his brothers and Sisters— It was
							a Tale of Crabbe’s, stripp’d of its poetry— On coming home I found
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> preparing to
							go in to Boston, and thence proceed on her return to Washington. Her
							health is very infirm, and I told my <persRef ref="adams-john2">Son
								John</persRef> to go with her. They left this House about five
							O’Clock— <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> continues

							enchased in it— I examined again the Deeds and Surveys of my father’s

								Withington</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon
								Adams</persRef> came this Morning, and we re-examined all the Deeds,
							Wills and Surveys to ascertain where the Lands not included in
							Withington’s Survey can be— We got however little information further
							than what I had traced on Saturday. Deacon Adams thought the Savil lot
							of eleven Acres had been occupied by my uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter"
								>Peter’s</persRef> heirs, and said there had been some question
							between him and <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>
							woodsmen, in their life time about the boundaries— I sent for <persRef
								ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef>, my uncle’s Administrator,
							and after some examination, we agreed that Withington should make a new
							survey the day after to-morrow, at which Turner should be present.
							Deacon Adams told me that several persons had spoken to him about
							purchasing some of the lots, and advised me, if I wished to purchase,
							not much to regard the appraisements as returned in the Inventory. He
							thought the whole Land would not sell for more than the appraisement;
							but particular Lots might be bidden for higher— I asked him to bid for
							me and he said he would come to-morrow Morning, and receive directions
							from me, as to the limits of his bidding— <persRef ref="mason-aaron"
								>Mason</persRef> came with an account against my fathers Estate

							Evening called to pay visits— <persRef ref="adams-john2">My Son

							this Evening to Boston. He brought here the Jewelry I had ordered, and I
							gave <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> the ring intended for

							which one from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Quincy</persRef> who has seen <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">T. H. Perkins</persRef>, and thinks the Railway
							Corporation will purchase the Woodlots through which they pass at any
							price— This makes it necessary for me carefully to conciliate my duty to
							the Estate, to obtain the utmost for the Lands, with my duty to my own
							family not to involve myself with burdensome, and profitless purchases—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> has
							postponed her intended departure for Washington— I slept with George
							last Night. He is this day rather better, but still exceedingly feeble—
							I had this Evening a long conversation with him, upon his own purposes
							and prospects for the future, and upon those of his brother John;
							subjects which occasion great concern to their mother and to me. His
							Explanation and Declarations were satisfactory to me, so far as he knows
							his own feelings; and for the rest we must hope and trust.</p>

								<persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Withington</persRef>, to be exhibited at the Sale— <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef> came soon after and took

								<persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							they would have the land at any price, and cautioned me to beware of
							attempting to outbid them, beyond what I thought the land was worth. But
							I directed Deacon Adams, whatever price they should bid, to bid one
							dollar more for it— The Lands were all bidden off for me; all within the
							limits I had prescribed, and very near the apprized value; excepting the
							two Lots for which Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins bid, for
							one nearly three times, and for the other more than four times the

								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, and returned to Boston

							to make payments on the check of either of the Executors. I returned to

							my grandfather dated April 1717, of ten Acres of Land, but we could not

								>George</persRef> who is this day much better, the two old Record
							Books of the Town of Braintree, to examine them for any thing relating

								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to him dated in August

							the American Academy of arts and Sciences, and also to communicate to

							deliver an Eulogy, before the Academy in October— The Doctor shewed me
							also a Letter from myself to him written in 1813 and asked my leave to
							make what use of it he pleased, which I gave him— He went with me to
							President Kirkland’s, and we all went, and viewed, the Philosophy room,
							now where the chapel formerly was—the Cabinet of Mineralogy which was
							the Commons Hall— The Library, occupying the chamber where it formerly
							was and also the old philosophy chamber, and the anatomical and chemical
							lecturing rooms. President Kirkland dined with us at D<hi

							been— She conversed with me on family subjects of painful interest, till
							I was fearful she would be exhausted, and she requested me, to return to
							Quincy to attend to my necessary business, and to be with George. I
							accordingly came, and got home between 9 and 10 in the Evening. Found
							George gaining strength, but still affected with grave symptoms. I sat

							upon myself. I finally requested him to make an estimate of what the
							place might probably be rented for, with, or without a Stock of Cattle,
							and holding the Tenant to terms which would keep the Land in a condition
							as good as it now is. I had also a Conversation with <persRef
								ref="adams-george">my Son George</persRef> upon his prospects and
							future purposes in which I made known to him my own intentions with
							regard to my father’s Estate, and his grants to the Town for a Temple

							service, the objects of my life for its short remainder would be to
							accomplish the two designs for which he made his grants to the Town of
							Quincy— The erection of a Temple built of Stone, and the Establishment
							of a School or Academy, for the preparatory Education of youth for the
							University—and with this to do as far as may be in my power justice to
							the memory of my father, by writing Memoirs of his Life— George is
							perfectly well disposed in his intentions; and if his health may be

								Whitney</persRef> this morning, from Matthew 22.29. [“]Jesus
							answered and said unto them, ye do err, not knowing the scriptures”—a
							controversial unitarian discourse, consisting chiefly of expositions, of
							the texts of Scripture, cited by Trinitarians in defence of their
							creed.— Without positively declaring his disbelief in the existence of
							the devil—whom he considers as a mere personification of Sin— <persRef
								ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>
							of Hingham preached this afternoon, from Hebrews 12.2. “Looking unto
							Jesus”— This was altogether practical— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brooks is intelligent, and writes well, but has a drawling manner of
							delivery. At the close of the Service he gave notice that the Communion
							would be administered the next Lord’s day, and of my desire, and that of
							Seaver and his wife, and of Hannah Lee to join in full communion with
							the Church— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks accepted my invitation
							to take tea with us and <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> lately
							returned after an absence of five years in Europe came with him—
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> called here, and we had conversation concerning the
							Execution of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will— He
							approved of the draft, I had made for a Deed of the Lands sold, from the
							Executors to me— I had not yet finished any of the others— I spoke of
							the Sale of the Tomb, and of the Report that a thousand dollars would be
							offered for it upon a speculation. He expressed some regret that it had
							been included in the inventory and proposed that it should be made a
							condition of Sale that if it should be purchased by any person not of
							the family it should not be delivered to the purchaser in less than four
							years— But the Law and the Will imperatively require the Sale, and I
							thought it would be sufficient to give notice at the Sale, that if the
							Tomb should be purchased by any person not of the family, the Executors
							reserved to themselves the right of removing the coffins and persons
							deposited in them to another before they would deliver possession of the
							Tomb to the purchaser— I spoke also to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy of my father’s donations to the Town for the erection of a
							Temple, and a School, and of my own wishes before the close of my own
							life, to see those objects accomplished— I found him averse to the
							building of the Temple upon the Lot given by my father to the Town— Of
							this there may be further consideration— I spent the Evening till
							Midnight with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> in
							Conversation upon my own early life, and his prospects and conduct, and
							those of his brothers— His health is yet very precarious, and his
							complaints various, complicated, and distressing— May they be
							removed.</p>

						<p>Belated rising— My Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>
							though yet far from well, went to Boston in the Stage this Morning. I
							was occupied in examining antient family papers, and in drafting papers
							for the execution of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>
							Will, and with talking to <persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Farrar</persRef>,
							about the disposal of my farm for this winter and for the ensuing year.
							I propose to leave it this coming winter in his charge, and to give him
							a lease of it in the Spring— I found among the Mount Wollaston papers a
							copy of the proceedings of the Proprietors of the Town Lands; which may
							be useful in tracing the Lands apparent on my father’s Deeds which we
							have not yet been able to find— <persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington</persRef> came about ten
							O’Clock, and <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef> soon
							after— I sent to ask <persRef ref="bass-josiah">Captain Josiah
								Bass</persRef>, and <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter
								Turner</persRef> to go with us in to the Woods— Bass came about
							Noon. We examined again the Deeds, Withington’s Surveys, and the old
							Survey of <persRef ref="bass-jedidiah">Jedidiah Bass</persRef> in 1785,
							till near one O’Clock—then took a light dinner, and went into the Woods—
							Peter Turner, and <persRef ref="porter-david3">David Porter</persRef>
							went with us— We had three parcels of Land to find— One Lot of more than
							eleven Acres, conveyed by Deed of the heirs of <persRef
								ref="savil-benjamin">Benjamin Savil</persRef> to John Adams 5.
								Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1795— A Lot of about Six Acres
							contained in the Deed of <persRef ref="borland-leonard">Leonard Vassall
								Borland</persRef> to John Adams of 6. Sept<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1787. and a difference of about seven Acres, between a

								<persRef ref="beale-benjamin">Benj<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
								Beale</persRef>, and Withington’s second survey of the same land— We
							this day only surveyed and marked what according to the Deed of Savil’s
							heirs I think must be the eleven Acre lot, in doing which we took in
							Land which has been divided between the Heirs of <persRef
								ref="adams-peter">Peter Boylston Adams</persRef>— We marked also
							what we took to be the six acre Borland lot; which the heirs of my uncle
							Peter, have also divided among themselves, without title, but upon a
							mere report of a blind old man named <persRef ref="bass-joseph">Joseph
								Bass</persRef>— We had not time to go upon the 20 Acre lot partly
							purchased of B. Beale— Farrar and <persRef ref="pote-william">William
								Pote</persRef> went with us as Chain carriers— We returned about
							Sunset. Captain Bass and Deacon Adams came in and took Withington’s last
							Survey of the Quincy lot, for a reapprizement of it with <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> to be returned to
							the judge of Probate. My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>
							came out from Boston, just before we went into the Woods, and returned
							before we came back— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My

								<persRef ref="bollan-frances">Frances Bollan</persRef>, daughter of
