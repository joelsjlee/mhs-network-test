						<dateline>Sunday 1. January 1826</dateline>
						<p><date>1. V.</date> Sunday. Walk round the Tyber Square.</p>
						<p>Rode with <persRef ref="mease-isabella">Miss Mease</persRef>, to the
							Unitarian Church, and heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> from Luke 11.28. “But
							he said, yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep
							it.” The Communion service was performed, in which Miss Mease joined—
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth Adams</persRef> was also
							with us— Note from <persRef ref="sullivan-george">G. Sullivan</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, saying that he would come
							and dine with us— In the afternoon, I attended at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s, <persRef ref="hawley-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawleys</persRef> Church, and
							heard a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee</persRef>,
							from Isaiah 5.4.5.6. “What could have been done more to my vineyard,
							that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should
							bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?— And now go to: I will
							tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge
							thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof; and
							it shall be trodden down:— And I will lay it waste: it shall not be
							pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will
							also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.”— Neither the
							morning nor the afternoon discourse was occasional, upon the
							commencement of the year. G. Sullivan was there and came, dined and
							spent part of the Evening with us— <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Watkins</persRef> came also this
							Evening, and read to me the Address to the Columbian Institute which he
							is to deliver next Saturday. I freely remarked upon it— The D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> also told me that <persRef
								ref="kent-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent</persRef> now
							a member of the House of Representatives, would to-morrow be elected
							Governor of Maryland, by the Legislature— Two expresses had been sent to
							him who arrived this morning; and he has been prevailed upon to accept,
							after having previously declined being a candidate.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI.</date> Walk to the Capitol—</p>
						<p><persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							the Attorney General called soon after Breakfast— <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had
							written to him at Baltimore; requesting him if he could conveniently to
							come here; with a view to take his opinion upon several points of Law,
							which have arisen in the case of <persRef ref="thomson-edward">Edward
								Thompson’s</persRef> failure, and the frauds at the Philadelphia
							Custom-House— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said he would be
							obliged to return on Wednesday to Baltimore. In the mean time he will
							give his opinion upon the questions propounded, here— The usual
							Visitation of the New-Year’s day, was made at this house from Noon till
							three O’Clock, and the crowd of company was said to have been greater
							than ever had been known before—amounting from two or three thousand
							persons. The greater portion of the members of both Houses of Congress
							were here; and formed only a small part of the company— The <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">British</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="obregon-pable">Mexican Ministers</persRef> came, and the
								<persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">Brazilian Charge
								d’Affaires</persRef>; but neither the <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick"
								>Russian</persRef> nor <persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">French
								Ministers</persRef>, nor any persons of their Legations— They had
							applied last week to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, the Secretary of State, suggesting their
							old objection to coming with the crowd, and proposed to come in State,
							another day; say to-morrow; which I explicitly declined; being unwilling
							to make two days of ceremony instead of one; and still more so to yield
							to their pretensions, which I think quite unreasonable. I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to inform them, that if they were
							desirous of avoiding a crowd they might do so by coming before half past
							twelve, or about three. The <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier
								Huygens</persRef> the Minister from the Netherlands came, after
							three, and left Cards, but did not come in— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy came to my Cabinet
							after the throng had withdrawn, and left with me the Supplementary
							charges of <persRef ref="vandyke-alexander">Midshipman Van
								Dyke</persRef> against <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Captain John
								Rodgers</persRef>— He also read to me his draft of an Answer to Van
							Dyke refusing to arrest Rodgers and censuring the temper of the Charges.
							I suggested to him some alterations of the draft, to which he assented.
							He also left with me a list of names for our ships of war, frigates and
							Corvettes to be completed. I was until dinner time much fatigued with
							the ceremony of the morning. The Band of Musick <pb type="ms" n="54"/>of
							the Marine Corps, enlivened the day while the company were here; and
							left something of depression after they were gone— <persRef
								ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persRef>,
							Senator from Massachusetts came and spent an hour of the Evening with
							me. He brought a large file of papers relating to the nomination of
								<persRef ref="swanton-john">J. B. Swanton</persRef> as Collector
							at Bath in Maine—among which were several private and confidential
							Letters to me, which had been first given inadvertently from my files to
							the Secretary of the Treasury, and then from him to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd; Chairman of the Committee to which
							the nomination had been referred— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd
							observed justly that they ought not to have been given to the Committee
							at all; and left the file with me to take off any of them as I should
							think proper— He left also a minute given him by the <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller</persRef>, importing objection
							against the appointment of a <persRef ref="miller-frederick">Mister
								Miller</persRef>, as Collector at Blakely Alabama, though his name
							had been sent to me from the Treasury Department for Nomination; and
							although I had delayed sending in for several days all the Treasury
							Nominations, to ascertain that all the individuals nominated were
							regular in their Accounts— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd spoke
							also to me of the Resolution offered to the Senate by <persRef
								ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch</persRef>;
							but, he said not drawn up by Branch; who was a mere tool in the hands of
							another man behind the curtain. He supposed the Resolution would be
							referred to the Committee of Foreign Relations, which would report it
							back and sustain it— He believed it would not pass; but would be laid on
							the table— It proceeded undoubtedly from a disposition unfriendly to me;
							but perhaps the positive manner in which I had expressed myself had
							given some handle to the construction which the Resolution gave to my
							words— Perhaps I might take occasion to send an explanation of my real
							meaning to the Senate— I said I had certainly no pretension to
							infallibility: that I may have expressed myself in terms susceptible of
							misconstruction, I could not deny, but in this case the misconstruction
							was so palpably erroneous that I could not think an explanation from me,
							necessary to expose it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch had been
							compelled to add his own mistaken inference to my words, in order to
							make up the substance of a charge against me. He states me to have
							asserted, that which I did not assert— He calls upon the Senate to
							accuse, try and convict me, in secret inquisition, without hearing me in
							my defence; without even letting me know that there was a charge against
							me— If I must choose between the alternative of such a Resolution of the
							Senate recorded against me, or of resorting to the humiliating expedient
							of sending to the Senate an explanation of my own words, I thought I
							should prefer the last. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd admitted
							there was weight in these observations and I added that I found no
							article or clause in the Constitution of the United States, delegating
							the right or the power to define, limit or declare what are or are not
							the Constitutional powers of the President— He said again he believed
							the Resolution would not be adopted; but it would be well to be prepared
							for it when brought forward by the Committee of Foreign Relations— He
							repeated that Branch was only the vehicle by whom the Resolution was
							produced, that he was himself incapable either of drawing up the
							Resolution, or of sustaining it, in debate. In this I believe he was
							mistaken— Branch though a man of humble parts is quite capable of
							draughting such a resolution—and of sustaining it by some eloquence,
							though to a very minute extent.</p>

								Mills</persRef> called and had further Conversation with me
							respecting the Resolution offered to the Senate by <persRef
								ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch</persRef>.
							He says Branch told him that he did not propose moving the reference of
							it to the Committee of Foreign Relations— He said it was a plain
							proposition of matter of fact; concerning which every member could make
							up his own mind— Mills said he did not believe the Resolution would
							pass; it would either be laid on the table or a direct vote rejecting it
							might be obtained— I said the Senate might dispose of it as they should
							think proper, if they should not pass it— But if the Senate were to take
							an attitude of positive hostility to the Administration, I thought this
							was ground upon which the Executive would stand defensively stronger
							than perhaps any other that could be taken— A secret tribunal, or
							Inquisition of State, in which they constitute themselves accusers,
							triers, judges and Executioners against the President of the United
							States upon impeachable matters without hearing him, without even
							informing him that they are receiving charges against him. Mills said
							that the subject would not be called up for several days, in as much as
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch had been suddenly called home
							by the illness or death of some near relation— <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Bailey</persRef> called to recommend sundry persons to office—
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> brought a written Note from the French Minister, the
								<persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Baron de Mareuil</persRef>,
							requesting that I would appoint a time when he could come and offer me
							his Congratulations on the new year; and present to me all the members
							of his Legation; which I declined— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							had prepared an answer, expressing much acknowledgment for the kindness
							of the Baron; but that no usage having warranted such a formality I did
							not feel justified to introduce it.— <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> mentioned that <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Harrison
								Smith</persRef> had accepted the agency to go to Philadelphia, and
							investigate the transactions at the Custom House, in relation to the
							teas of <persRef ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thompson</persRef>; and we
							had long Conversation about the Instructions to be given to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith for the execution of his trust—
								<persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> came, and spoke
							of the application of <persRef ref="worth-william">Major Worth</persRef>
							of West Point, for a brevet upon his brevet—which I have declined
							granting. The General spoke also of the conflicting claims of <persRef
								ref="king-wiliam">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> King</persRef>
							and of <persRef ref="bissell-daniel">General Bissell</persRef> to the
							vacant appointment of Colonel of the second Regiment of Infantry— I said
							that Bissells claim simply to be ordered upon duty, as if he had been
							without interruption in the army, could not be granted—but I had read
							his papers and for the vacant appointment thought he had made out a very
							strong case. Thirty odd years of constant service in the army—a rise
							from the ranks—distinguished good conduct on various occasions— I
							thought too <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> had
							treated Bissell rather harshly— And whatever the misconduct of Bissell
							might have been, there was no evidence bringing it home to him— Brown
							said that of Scott’s proceedure he thought as I did; but of Bissell’s
							vicious conduct, particularly of his having ruined many young men in the
							army by gambling the testimony to him was so strong that he firmly
							believed it— Brown had sent me two or three days since a Letter from
								Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Scott, highly indignant at the
							appointment of <persRef ref="crogham-george">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Croghan</persRef> as Inspector General— Scott’s Letter
							also mentioned that the Officers of the army, with him at New-York, were
							all excessively irritated at this appointment, and had talked of a
							meeting to shew their resentment which he Scott had prevented— Brown
							said they would not indulge themselves in any excess; but that such
							would be their feelings unanimously. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef> brought some
							papers from the Department of State. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> read me the draft
							of his Answer to a Resolution from the House of Representatives, calling
							for information concerning the Sloop of War Boston, and enquiring

							send Cannon to the Mouth of Columbia river— Evening spent in my cabinet
							writing. </p>

								Gurley</persRef>, who is a member of the House of Representatives,

									>r</hi> Everett</persRef>— The Secretary of the Senate <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowry</persRef>

							Skipwith; but these Letters staggered greatly my good will towards him—

							enclosed three Notes to individual Senators to be delivered to them if
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush should think it advisable,

							brevets— Their obnoxiousness to Congress, and to the Public; which he
							admitted— He spoke also of the Resolution offered by <persRef

							of its unfairness and injustice; and said it had been very offensive to

								ref="hamilton-james3">Major Hamilton</persRef> of South-Carolina,
							have now reported a Bill upon the Massachusetts Claim, entirely
							different from that which at the recommendation of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							they had reported two Years ago— It was then in substance for the whole
							claim: it is now only for that part of it which is not affected by the
							Constitutional stumbling block which <persRef ref="strong-caleb"
								>Governor Strong</persRef> of Massachusetts had interposed— a part
							which the Executive of the Union could not lawfully reject— <persRef
								ref="king-william">William King</persRef> of Maine, attempted to
							make of this claim an electioneering Engine for <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>—but he disclosed
							his purpose prematurely to Sullivan, who by obtaining the Agency for the
							State of Massachusetts, defeated King’s Crawfordite intrigue; but threw
							the whole interest into the hands of <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef>— He by prevailing upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe to decide inflexibly upon sending the whole claim to
							Congress, kept it in fact in his own hands— It went of course to the
							Military Committee; the chairman of which, Hamilton, was devoted to him—
							By the President’s warm recommendation of the claim to Congress; and by
							a corresponding Bill, promptly reported by the Military Committee,
							Calhoun kept Sullivan in the undoubting belief, that he was himself
							entirely friendly to the claim, and that it would be admitted in its
							whole extent— In the mean time he secured Sullivan’s ardent and zealous
							support to his election as Vice-President, which by Sullivan’s intimacy
							with me; and by his influence over many of the Massachusetts Electors,
							and particularly <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Winthrop</persRef>, Sullivan’s father in Law, was very
							efficacious— It decided Calhoun’s Election— But during all this time,
							and through both Sessions of the last Congress, the Bill reported by the
							Military Committee was artfully kept suspended, and never passed— Now,
							the Military Committee report a totally different Bill; cutting off
							nearly two thirds of the claim; and the members avowing that they will
							oppose the admission of any part of it, to which the constitutional
							objection had been applied— Sullivan has been cruelly deceived, but his
							pride will not permit him to acknowledge it; perhaps not even to
							himself— He is however preparing to abandon the claim; and also his
							residence at Boston, where under his ill success, to return <pb

								<persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. H.

							allegiance the subjects of Princes who should be backward in carrying
							the decree into execution— Even this atrocious Edict, he almost
							explained away— He closed by reading an admirable prayer— He came and

							repeated with great ease; but she ran into a continual sing song of

							When she had finished her Sermon, after a short interval she knelt and

								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>, who thought
							the Teas must be kept, for a decision by a judicial tribunal, whether
							they are not all answerable to the United States, for the whole <pb
								type="ms" n="62"/>amount of the duties owed by Thompson— He said he
							was glad the decision of the Government was placed on that ground, as he
							felt more solicitous for the character of the house than for the
							property— But he said, the Teas were in some respect a perishable
							Article— If kept until the arrival of the Spring ships from China, they
							would lose three fourths of their price in the market. They had already
							lost much. He enquired if they could not be delivered over to the
							Lippincott’s on their giving bond with sufficient security to abide by
							the decision of the Court upon the question of the right of the United

							without difficulty, it being suggested in the opinion of the

							Resolution to call for Papers relating to the proposed Mission to

							Message would in due time be sent by the Executive to the house
							concerning it; he was willing his Resolution should lie on the
							table—reserving his right to call it up when he should see cause— Last
							Thursday he gave notice that he should call it up the next day; but he
							did not and has not yet— I told Everett that if he should call it up, it
							would be perhaps proper to urge its postponement from respectful
							deference to the Senate, to give them time to act, on the nominations
							now before them— With intimations that perhaps the Senate might
							disapprove of the Mission; in which case the house would have no
							occasion to act upon it at-all— I supposed this would bring Hamilton
							more out, and further disclose the views of the party of which he is the
							organ— He cannot keep their Counsel— This is apparently the first
							measure, in which the opposition are endeavouring to array themselves—
							They are bitter and rancorous, but are yet discordant among themselves—
							If they can be brought to combine.</p>

							Mills drew it accordingly; and when presented in Senate, Tazewell
							opposed its passage might and main. The Committee will report against

							This is only way that I can meet such benevolent importunities; and even

							him his own in return— The Speaker <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef> stayed an hour after the rest of the company were
							gone— And spoke of <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef> of
							South-Carolina’s sally at him, for presenting to the House a Memorial
							from a Crazy Man in France, who invited Congress to destroy all <pb
								type="ms" n="64"/>the States which should refuse the emancipation of
							Slaves. Hamilton was not countenanced in his fit of chivalry; but Taylor
							said he had notice that a more formal attack upon him was intended, and
							by more formidable adversaries— He was told that a person of far more
							consideration and talents than Hamilton, and of the South-Carolina
							delegation, had spoken of this incident as proof of a fixed
							determination of the present administration to emancipate the Southern
							Slaves— He spoke also of Hamilton’s Resolution to call for the Papers
							relating to the Panama Mission— I said I believed it would be best to
							keep it alive; but if he called it up soon to put it off, and bring him
							out in his Hotspur vein till he shall disclose more of the secret views
							of his party. I told Taylor I believed the Message concerning the Panama
							Mission, must be a confidential one—to which he assented.</p>

								ref="thomson-edward">Thompson’s</persRef> Teas there had been on his

						<p><persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Dickins</persRef> came concerning the
							allowance of a claim of <persRef ref="crittenden-robert"
								>Crittenden</persRef>, Secretary of the Arkansas Territory— I gave
							him the certificate of <persRef ref="letcher-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Letcher</persRef>, upon which the
							allowance is to be made— <persRef ref="hammond-jabez">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hammond</persRef> the Agent for the
							State of New-York came to take leave. I told him I had read with great
							attention the papers he had left with me, and thought there was great
							weight in his argument, upon the only item of which he desired the
							revision. But the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, upon examination had found that the decision of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> upon that item, had been made with all the
							documents before him, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hammond had
							believed to have been subsequently produced. Under these circumstances,
							we could not reverse the decision of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun, but as there were other items upon the claim, which were to be
							submitted to Congress, this would properly go before them at the same
							time. Governor Barbour in speaking of this affair to me some days since,
							seemed to doubt whether I ought to have received these papers from
							Hammond— I said I thought it my duty to hear every man who asked of me a
							hearing; and to read all papers which any person presented to me; but
							that my decisions upon them must be through the Departments; and as
							their Heads advise— <persRef ref="warrington-lewis">Captain
								Warrington</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-bartow">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>, a Member from Duchess
							County New York and <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> were
							visitors— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> spoke of despatches, of very recent date received
							from <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef> the Minister to Mexico, from which it appears
							that the Expedition against Cuba is postponed— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay spoke also of the appointment to be made of a Chargé
							d’Affaires to Peru, and gave me a recommendation of <persRef
								ref="adair-john">General Adair</persRef> of Kentucky for that
							office; in which however he did not join— He warmly urged the
							appointment of <persRef ref="warfield-henry">Henry R Warfield</persRef>
							member of the last Congress from Maryland— To this however there are
							weighty objections— <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>
							came to enquire if I should have any objection to the repeal of the Law
							by which appointments in the staff of the army are authorised to be made
							from persons not in the army. He said there was a Resolution to that
							effect now before the House of Representatives; and he wished to know my
							Sentiments concerning it, to determine him whether to take an interest
							in its success or not— I told him that I was willing it should have its
							fair chance with Congress— I should exercise no influence against it.
							The Resolution had evidently been brought in with a view to set a mark
							of reprobation upon the recent appointment of <persRef
								ref="crogham-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Croghan</persRef>— It could not be expected that I should encourage
							or give countenance to that which was intended for censure upon my own
							Act— But I should excite no opposition to it— I was not tenacious of the
							power of selecting, and if Congress should think proper to <pb type="ms"
								n="68"/>restrict it I should readily acquiesce— The General spoke of
							the appointment of Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Croghan again with
							much sensibility— Said it had been altogether unexpected to him. A thing
							he believed without example, in any service. I said I much regretted
							that it should so have affected him— That I had assured him repeatedly,
							that it was without any unkind intention towards him— That I was bound
							to act according to the advice deliberately given me by the Heads of
							Departments in the Affairs of their Offices, and that the Act, whether
							correct or not was done and could not be recalled— I was willing
							Congress should proceed upon the Resolution, with a full consideration
							of what I had done in that case; and should if they pleased find in it a
							motive, for limiting the appointments in future. But this was all I
							could say— The General declared that he would take no further concern in
							the matter— <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Message, was by my Diary, and taking privately
							a copy of it, as a member of the Senate when the Message was sent in— I

							transaction disgraceful— I was not aware of any thing in it which could
							even be justly called improper. Nor did I know whence M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane drew his information— That I had
							not been in the Senate in January 1803. when this Message of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson was sent and I told him how I
							had found it on the Records of the Senate, while my own Message to

							interrupted and Cook left me, but told <persRef

							that A. Stevenson further said that since my Message the excitement
							against the General Government in Virginia was great, and universal.
							That opinions there had before then been divided; but now the whole

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson, and <persRef

							denouncing the doctrines of the Message in the most emphatic terms—

							this day be printed— That he did not know how the vote in Senate would
							go—he believed there would be a majority to confirm the nomination. The
							minority however would be large, though he would do all in his power to
								<pb type="ms" n="69"/>make it smaller— He did not know what the

							afraid it would induce <persRef ref="hendricks-william"
								>Hendricks</persRef> of Indiana to vote against the nominations, but
								<persRef ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>r</hi> Rush, brought and left with me several Letters— He had a

							for public services before he was President, but part of this Letter
							from the Register referred to his own mistake in a statement of my

							the first draught of a new Treaty with the Creek Indians, upon which he
							has nearly agreed with them through the Medium of <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>— Every attempt to prevail

							evening to commit suicide. This morning however a new effort had been

							hitherto been willing to yield— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour
							said this was all he could expect to do; and advised to conclude with
							them on these terms— I agreed that he should— I read over his draft, and
							urged the expediency of some supplementary provisions, for the benefit
							of the other portion of the Creek tribe the friends of <persRef
								ref="mcintosh-william2">Mackintosh</persRef>, which Governor Barbour

								<persRef ref="tait-charles">Charles Tait</persRef> who resigns. But
								<persRef ref="king-william2">W. R. King</persRef> one of the

								Dillet</persRef>— And in proportion to their earnestness against
							Crawford, is his tenaciousness in his favour. I mentioned to him that I
							had received recommendations in favour of <persRef ref="pickens-israel"
								>Israel Pickens</persRef> the late Governor of the State; at which
							he appeared to be surprized— Cabinet Meeting, from Noon till four
							O’Clock. I read my draft of a Message to be sent in to the Senate with
							the new Creek Treaty— The Report of the <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>; and the Treaty itself— Several
							alterations were suggested by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> to the Message which I
							adopted— Some alterations were also proposed to the Report of the
							Secretary of War, and Governor Barbour took it away to make them— The
							principal question discussed was whether all the Correspondence with the
								<persRef ref="troup-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef>; and all
							the controversial papers, of Governor Troup, <persRef ref="crowell-john"
								>J. Crowell</persRef><persRef ref="andrews-t">J. P.
								Andrews</persRef> and <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General
								Gaines</persRef> should be communicated to the Senate with the
							Treaty or not— Governor Barbour was desirous that they should not be
							sent; thinking that withholding them much angry discussion may be
							obviated— I assented to the omission, wishing that the whole Transaction
							might be consummated according to the views of Governor Barbour— A
							principal motive for this is that Governor Barbour having been
							intimately confidential with the Georgians, they will be less disposed
							to violence against a measure entirely his, than if it came from other
							persons— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay rather inclined to the
							opinion that the whole body of Documents should be sent with the Treaty;
							but acquiesced in the suggestion, that if any member of the Senate
							should wish to see the correspondence, he could move a Call for it; and
							it could be immediately sent— It was agreed on all sides that if the
							Senate advise and consent to the Ratification of the Treaty, when sent
							to both Houses of Congress for the Appropriations to carry it into
							effect, all the documents must be sent— But they would not be likely to
							produce so much excitement or debate, as at this time before the
							decision of the Senate upon the Treaty— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay thought the new Treaty, a much more disadvantageous one to the
							United States than the former; and I have no doubt it will be so
							represented, but I am not of that opinion— Governor Barbour spoke of
							certain accounts of a General War and of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							to the <persRef ref="mcintosh-william2">Mackintosh</persRef> Indians;
							which Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Gaines had disallowed, and upon
							which an appeal from his decision is before the Secretary of War— I

								Cocke</persRef>, had pressed the appointment of a young man named
								<persRef ref="u">Queen</persRef>, in his place. <persRef ref="u"
								>Cook</persRef> had told him two days ago that Richards would
							resign, if Queen could be appointed— Rush declined giving any promise.
							Nevertheless Richards has resigned—for which I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, I was confident, there was some very
							special reason— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush requested me to name
							some person to him for the place. I mentioned to him <persRef
								ref="vanwyck-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Wyck</persRef> the late member of Congress from Duchess County
							New-York, and <persRef ref="french-ebenezer">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ebenezer French</persRef>, from whom I had received
							several very earnest solicitations. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							informed me that <persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> S. H. Smith</persRef> had returned from his mission to
							Philadelphia to investigate the recent extraordinary transactions at the
							Custom-house at that place. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay came and
							spoke of the call from the Senate, and said he had directed copies of
							the papers to be made out— He spoke also of the appointment of the
							Legislative Council for the Territory of Michigan— There are two acts of
							Congress, and one territorial act under which the election is made, and
							there is a question whether the Territorial Act is not contrary to the
							Laws of Congress. Out of 26 persons, having the highest numbers of the
							qualified votes of the inhabitant, the President is to nominate to the
							Senate 13. But the territorial Act, divided the Territory into
							Districts, and allowed the inhabitants of each District to vote only for
							a proportional number of the 26. The act of Congress authorised the
							Territorial Legislature to prescribe the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi>
							of the Election— Under which authority they made the Districts— I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay I doubted the legality of the
							territorial act, and must reflect further upon it. While with me M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay received a Note from <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— A debate commenced this day in the House of
							Representatives, on two Resolutions, calling for papers relating to the
							proposed Mission to Panama— This is the first subject upon which a great
							effort had been made in both Houses to combine the discordant elements,
							of the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> men into a united opposition,
							against the Administration— It is at an early stage of its progress; but
							has already become complicated, and admonishes me to proceed, with
							extreme circumspection. <persRef ref="hunter-william3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef> came to solicit the
							vacant Clerkship in the Treasury Department— I told him he was late—
							<persRef ref="johnson-james4">James Johnson</persRef> dined and spent part of the Evening with us— He is
							applying to be appointed Clerk of the Supreme Court U.S.</p>
