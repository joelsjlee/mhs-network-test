								Barbour</persRef> has received a very courteous Letter from <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Gov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Troup</persRef>
							of Georgia upon the interest taken by the Government of U.S. in the
							running of the boundary line between Georgia and Alabama— Also
							professing great personal esteem for him— Gov<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Barbour proposes that on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> after the usual
							ceremonies at the Capitol he should address the Audience and invite an
							immediate subscription for the benefit of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>— Says he proposes to give 100 dollars himself—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> came in while we speaking of it— I doubted the
							expediency of the measure and its success; and thought it would be more
							likely to succeed, if a meeting should be called and a subscription
							raised as elsewhere. Gov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barbour says the
							late rains have done immense and irreparable damage to his Estate— His
							loss many thousands— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush is preparing to
							answer a Resolution of H.R. for a <hi rend="italic">manual</hi>
							concerning the cultivation of silk finds the Subject grow upon
							him—proposes postponing the Report at least until the first Session of
							the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, and thinks of sending a
							person to visit the principal silk manufactures of Europe— I agreed upon
							the necessity of postponing the Report—but advised waiting at least till
							the next Session before sending an Agent, the expence of which I thought
							would be great. Mentioned to him the case of <persRef
								ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef> who was sent to Europe to
							procure Instruments for the Survey of the Coast—who purchased Books and
							Instruments to the amount of about 17000 dollars, with a charge of more
							than 20000 dollars additional for his compensation and expenses—
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">Brent</persRef> came with a petition for
							the discharge of <persRef ref="lovejoy-w">W. Lovejoy</persRef>,
							imprisoned for assault and battery. I signed the order. <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown</persRef>
							came to converse upon New-York and Georgia Politics. Has nothing new.
								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> brought a second, and conditional Report of the
							Commissioners to select sites for a Penitentiary in the District, and
							for a Jail in the County of Alexandria. They now have fixed the latter—
							Received a Letter from <persRef ref="weightman-roger">R. C.
								Weightman</persRef>, the mayor of Washington, with notice that
								<persRef ref="devaughn-jonathan">De Vaughn</persRef>, the murderer
							of <persRef ref="martin-tobias">Tobias Martin</persRef> was taken and in
							custody— After dinner I rode with <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> round by <persRef ref="smith-samuel">S. H.
								Smith’s</persRef> and the College; and collected in the woods, twigs
							of seven different varieties of Oaks, which after returning I compared
							with the Plates in <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux’s</persRef>
							first Volume— One or two of them seem different from any of those
							described by him— We found also the Shell-bark Hickory. <persRef

						<p>Swam from the Boat— 20 Minutes— with <unclear>symbols</unclear></p>
						<p>Heard at <persRef ref="hawley-william">Hawleys</persRef><persRef
								ref="darneille-r">R. Darneille</persRef> an Address to promote the
							Civilization of the Indians— The preacher said he was going to settle
							with his family in the Arkansas Territory, and devote the remainder of
							his Life to the cause. He solicited contributions; but the collection
							was for the colonization Society. <persRef ref="baker-daniel"
								>Baker</persRef>, from 1. Peter 3.15. “But sanctify the Lord God in
							your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that
							asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear”—
							Before he had got through, a thunder shower was coming up, and he
							dismissed the auditory with a blessing— After dinner I rode with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to the Navy-Yard and Eastern Branch— On
							the Capitol Hill I alighted, and heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>, from Titus 2.8.
							“Sound Speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary
							part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.” This was the
							second of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Littles Discourses against the
							deistical scheme of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Schulze</persRef>, backed by <persRef ref="smyth-alexander"
								>Alexander Smyth</persRef>, proposing simple deism and <persRef
								ref="seneca-lucius">Seneca’s</persRef> Morals, as a substitute for
							Christianity. He began by apologizing for the apparent levity of his
							first reply to these persons last Sunday. Offering as in part an excuse
							that there were sometimes things so absurd, that ridicule was the only
							suitable answer to them— He offered an argument to prove that it was
							easier to believe the existence of an omnipotent Spirit capable of
							creating matter and its properties;—than that matter and its properties
							were eternal— He then replied to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Smyth’s invective against Priests—and shewed the utility of such an
							order of men— He also presented a parallel between certain passages of
							Seneca’s Morals, which he read from a Translation by <persRef
								ref="lestrange-roger">Sir Roger Lestrange</persRef>; and the
							doctrines on the same Subjects, of Christ and his Apostle, illustrating
							the incomparable superiority of the Gospel— Admitting that there were in
							Seneca’s Morals many very good thinks; but commenting with severity upon
							the character and history of Seneca himself— And challenging all
							antiquity to produce any system of morals, comparable to the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapters of Matthew, and the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Chapter of the Romans— He is to sum and
							conclude next Sunday eve. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley this
							morning baptized a woman, and three female children. </p>

								Darneille</persRef> brought a subscription paper for a discourse to
							be published by him, containing his plan for civilizing the Indians— His
							plan embraces a farm and a school; and his object is to civilize the
							Indians by securing to them Settlement on the soil. I asked him if he
							had communicated his plan to the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary

							of the Indians from their neighbourhood. I advised him to see the
							Secretary of War again and make known to him his whole plan— <persRef

							Ex-Presidents, declining the invitations to attend the celebration here.

							the floor of the House made a short address to the same purpose— Not
							more than four or five subscribers were obtained, and notice was given
							by Governor Barbour, that others would have the opportunity to subscribe
							afterwards. The procession, with the exception of the military companies
							returned to the President’s House, where we received visitors till about

							the commonplaces of the day— But he had written it in loose fragments
							without much connection, and had not committed it to memory— So he read
							from his notes, and commented upon them extemporaneously, which made a
							desultory composition full of interesting matter, but producing little
							effect as a whole. Governor Barbour’s Address was the overflowing of a
							generous, benevolent and patriotic heart respectable even in its
							inefficiency— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush spoke also very

							cultivation and manufacture of Silk, and the wish to promote the
							plantation of live and White Oak, and perhaps other forest trees has
							driven me to consult at once the Books and the Forests:—and to shew me
							again how much I have yet to learn— The leaves that I took from three
							lofty and beautiful Oaks standing side by side of each other, were of
							three different varieties of the Tree— Two of them not described or
							represented by <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux</persRef>, and
							several of those described by him are so much alike, that I cannot
							determine to which of several varieties those that I find belong— I
							propose to commence a nursery the next Autumn, and to plant Acorns,
							Hickory Nuts and Chesnuts— But what is the Season for planting, and how
							is the nursery to be managed? I should have commenced this process at
							least thirty years since, but I have never had a permanent residence;

							any other; but not well with that. I now perceive the use of teaching
							young Ladies to draw leaves and flowers from nature— This study is one
							which ought to be commenced young and pursued through a whole life— But

						<p>I walked again through the Oak shrubbery, and selected various leaves,
							none however different from those I had found before— There was a
							meeting of the members of the Administration; <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> having returned from his visit in Virginia. It
							was upon full consideration that there should be no proclamation, upon
							the occasion of the decease of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, but I mentioned
							my opinion that it should be noticed in the next annual Message to
							Congress which was approved— General Orders from the War and Navy
							Departments, for the exhibition of funeral honours to the deceased were
							deemed proper— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							prepared such an order to be sent to <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef>, and transmitted by him as Commander in Chief— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard undertook to prepare a similar
							order to be sent to all the naval Stations— It was also thought proper
							that the Inhabitants of Washington, at the Call of <persRef
								ref="weightman-roger">the Mayor</persRef> and City Authorities,
							should take measures appropriate to the occasion— A funeral Service at
							the Capitol, at which the Chaplains of both Houses of Congress should
							officiate, occurred to me as very proper, and the selection of a person
							connected with the Administration, and of distinguished talents, to
							pronounce a funeral Eulogy, was suggested by Governor Barbour, and
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, who mentioned <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the Attorney General as
							well qualified for the task. General Brown was also here, and upon
							receiving the Order from the War Department will prepare an order to be
							sent to all the Military Stations— <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Henry
								Lee</persRef> called and told me that he had been last week to
							Monticello, to consult some papers relating to the revolutionary War, in
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s possession, and of which
							he had promised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee the perusal— He was
							there last week on Thursday, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson was though ill, yet able to converse with him on the subject,
							and hoped to be able to examine the papers with him in a few days— But
							from that time M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson grew worse, and
							on Sunday Lee gave up all expectation of seeing the papers, and left
							Monticello and Charlottesville—and returned. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard came a second time, with papers relating to the
							purchase of one of the Greek frigates building at New-York. <persRef
								ref="u">Contostavlo</persRef> and the contracting Houses, have left

						<p>The mail this morning brought me three Letters— One dated the 3<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Susan B. Clarke</persRef>,
							informing me that <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> end
							was approaching—that she wrote me, because <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
								>my brother</persRef> was absent in Boston— That <persRef
								ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef> who was attending as his Physician thought he
							would probably not survive two days, and certainly not more than a
							fortnight— The second was from my brother written on the morning of the
							fourth, announcing that in the opinion of those who surrounded my
							father’s couch, he was rapidly sinking— That they were sending an
							Express for my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, in
							Boston, who might perhaps arrive in time to receive his last breath— The
							third was from <persRef ref="adams-ann">my brother’s wife</persRef> to
							her daughter <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, to the
							same purport, and written in much distress. I immediately took the
							determination to proceed as speedily as possible to Quincy, and the
							remainder of the day was occupied in making preparations for my
							departure to-morrow Morning. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>, <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							together in the Evening; as was <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> of the Department of
							State— I left the Affairs of each Department in charge of the Officer at
							its head; and had not even time to give directions with regard to any
							special business of either Department. I signed an Order for the
							discharge of <persRef ref="thomas-harry">Harry Thomas</persRef> from
							prison upon a forfeited Recognizance; and had conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush upon the applications of the
							Insurance Companies respecting the Sales of <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thomson’s</persRef> Ships and their
							Cargoes— It was agreed that the Security of the Insurance Companies
							should be taken for one another— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Southard is to purchase one of the Greek Ships, if the <persRef ref="u"
								>Agent Contostavlo</persRef>, is desirous of making the Sale— The

							and apprehension till near Midnight. The suddenness of the notice of my
							father’s danger was quite unexpected. Some weeks since my brother had
							written to me that he was declining, though not so as to occasion
							immediate alarm, and my intention had been to visit him, about the
							beginning of the next Month. I had flattered myself that he would
							survive this Summer and even other years.</p>

						<p><date>9. IV.—</date> Sun rose 4:39— Washington— Baltimore—
							Frenchtown.</p>
						<p>At 5 this morning I left Washington, with my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, in my own Carriage with four
							horses— Yesterday had been one of the hottest days of the Summer, and
							there was every prospect that this day would be not less so. A light
							easterly breeze however came up as the Sun rose, and continued through
							the day— The heat of the Sun was however intense— My Servant <persRef
								ref="pote-william">William Pote</persRef> was sent with our trunks
							of heavy baggage in the Stage— We stopp’d half an hour between seven and
							eight at <persRef ref="ross-unknown3">Ross’s</persRef> tavern; and
							reached <persRef ref="merrill-john">Merrill’s</persRef> at Waterloo,
							where we breakfasted, before eleven— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Merrill told me that he had come this morning out from Baltimore, and
							was informed there that <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							died on the fourth of this Month, about five o’clock in the afternoon.
							From the Letters which I had yesterday received this event was so much
							expected by me, that it had no sudden and violent effect on my feelings—
							My father had nearly closed the ninety-first year of his life: A life
							illustrious in the Annals of his Country, and of the World— He had
							served to great and useful purpose his Nation, his Age, and his God— He
							is gone, and may the blessing of Almighty Grace have attended him to his
							Account— I say not, may my last End be like his! it were presumptuous—
							The time, the manner, the coincidence with the decease of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>, are visible and palpable
							marks of divine favour, for which I would humble myself in grateful and
							silent adoration before the Ruler of the Universe— For myself all that I
							dare to ask is that I may live the remnant of my days in a manner worthy
							of him from whom I came, and at the appointed hour of my maker die as my
							father has died; in peace with God and man, sped to the regions of
							futurity with the blessings of my fellow men— We proceeded on to
							Baltimore, and dined at <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef>
							tavern— I wrote a short Letter to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef> to be taken by the Coachman, who returns with the
							Carriage and Horses to Washington— At Baltimore I saw the New-York
							Evening-Post of Friday the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> containing a
							hand-bill of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> issued from the
							Courier Office at Boston; with an Account of the proceedings of the
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor</persRef> and Council of
							Massachusetts, and of the City Authorities of Boston, upon the decease
							of my father— <persRef ref="bentalou-paul">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Bentalou</persRef> the U.S. Marshal called upon me and
							accompanied me to the Steam-boat Constitution <persRef ref="u">Captain

							bright and fervent Sun;—and a very gentle breeze. Passengers in the boat
							few. I slept from 8 in the Evening till we arrived at Frenchtown at
							Midnight: There I took a Stage to Newcastle.</p>

								<persRef ref="thomson-edward">E. Thomson</persRef> and his teas, and
							particularly the claim of <persRef ref="nevins-william;nevins-samuel"
								type="multi">Nevins</persRef>. I said I thought the Security of the

							consistent with indispensable regard to the public interest, should be
							taken to avoid all unnecessary pressure upon that of Individuals, and
							that the sales of the Teas and the ships should be made in such manner

							said he might consider himself so far authorised to act, by me, as he
							would in two or three days receive a communication to the like effect
							from <persRef key="rush-richard">The Secretary of the

							Garden, planted by his father and by <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>President Washington</persRef>— He promised to furnish me both with

							and Sutherland to ride with me to Brunswick— Shaler having <persRef
								ref="u">his wife</persRef> with him, declined— The others, with
							Sergeant came with me. The day was intensely warm, with a bright Sun;
							but after his setting we had a cool evening ride, and alighted at the

							full, and the accommodations indifferent— <persRef ref="adams-john2">My

							The weather turned cool this Evening— The family remains here still, as

							had last taken leave of him; and where I had most sat with him at my two
							last yearly visits to him at this place— That moment was inexpressibly
							painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to the heart. My
							father and my mother have departed. The charm which has always made this
							house to me an abode of enchantment is dissolved: and yet my attachment
							to it, and to the whole region round is stronger than I ever felt it
							before— I feel it is time for me to begin to set my house in order, and
							to prepare for the Church-yard myself— Other duties in the meantime
							devolve upon me from this recent event, the full extent of which I pray
							that I may know— As I do for the holy Spirit of grace to discharge
							them.</p>

						<p>Bathed this Morning with the same party as last Evening— I swam from
							wharf to wharf— But the same eruptive heat which was troublesome to me
							before I left Washington, continues, and seems to be more irritated by
							the Salt water, than by that of the River. The company occupied most of
							the day— My reflections upon my own situation and duties engrossed the
							remainder, so that I found barely time for writing to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="adams-john">My father</persRef> by his Will has given me the
							option of taking this House, and about 93. Acres of Land round it, upon
							securing the payment of ten thousand dollars with interest in three
							years from the time of his decease— After making this bequest he made a
							donation to the town of part of the Lands; detaching eight Acres on the
							road, of the grounds opposite to the house, but leaving the condition
							unaltered. It is repugnant to my feelings, to abandon this place where
							for near forty years he has resided, and where I have passed many of the
							happiest days of my life— I shall within two or three years if indulged
							with life and health need a place of retirement— Where else should I go—
							This will be a safe and pleasant retreat where I may pursue literary
							occupations, as long and as much as I can take pleasure in them— I
							cannot sufficiently anticipate my own dispositions to know, whether the
							Country will for the whole remnant of my days fill up my time and
							attention so much as to sustain the interest of existence— From an
							active and much agitated life, to pass suddenly and forever to a
							condition of total retirement and almost of Solitude, is a trial to
							which I cannot look without some concern and with far more for my
							immediate family connections than for myself. Perhaps I shall find that
							in the Winter Season, the excitement of a City will prove to be a
							necessary of Life— But even in that case the Country will be not less
							indispensable as a Residence for the Summer— By taking this place I
							avoid the necessity of building a house which would be a heavy
							aggravation of expence— It is also no small object to me to secure to my
							brother and his family the means of remaining here, at least until he
							can look round him to find a residence more suitable to him— This he
							probably could not do before the ensuing Spring— <persRef

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> from 1. Corinthians 15.19. [“]If in this life only
							we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable”— A discourse
							somewhat occasional, upon the decease of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>— But he preached a Sermon at the funeral— I have at
							no time felt more deeply affected by that Event, than on entering the
							Meeting House, and taking in his pew the Seat which he used to occupy—
							Having directly before me, the pew at the left of the pulpit which was
								<persRef ref="adams-john4">his father’s</persRef>, and where the
							earliest devotions of my childhood were performed— The memory of my
							father and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>, of their
							tender and affectionate care, of the times of peril in which we then
							lived, and of the hopes and fears which left their impressions on my
							mind came over me, till involuntary tears started from my eyes— I looked
							around the house, with enquiring thoughts—where were those whom I was
							then wont to meet in this house— The aged of that time; the Pastor by
							whom I had been baptized, the deacons who sat before the communion
							table, have all long since departed— Those then in the Meridian of life
							have all followed them— Five or six persons then children like myself,
							under the period of youth were all that I could discern, with grey hairs
							and furrowed cheeks, two or three of them with families of a succeeding
							generation around them. The house was not crowded, but well
							filled—though with almost another race of men and women— It was a
							comforting reflection that they had the external marks of a Condition
							much improved upon that of the former age— <persRef ref="brooks-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> of Hingham
							preached in the afternoon from Revelations 2.10. “Be thou faithful unto
							death, and I will give thee a crown of life”— Also an occasional Sermon,
							intelligent and affecting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks called
							after church for about half an hour, but could not stay to tea— I
							answered <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour’s</persRef>
							Letter— I had agreed to go this afternoon with <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							to the judge of Probate’s, to ascertain when he would grant Probate of
							my father’s Will, but in consequence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brooks’s visit, postponed it. I walked with my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> down to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy’s and spent the Evening with his family. His daughter
							lately married, <persRef ref="greene-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jackson</persRef>
							were there. <persRef ref="quincy-eliza2">Miss Quincy</persRef> shewed me

							presenting themselves, and necessarily engage time, and I must expect to
							have many Letters to answer— This is not yet retirement; nor a sample of
							the trial for which I must be prepared.</p>

							Vouchers and Securities of personal Estate— I also assorted and filed
							most of the obsolete and useless papers. This led me to an attentive

								John Adams Senior</persRef>, proved 10 July 1761. with the probate
							annexed, and an Inventory of the Estate— Of my Great-grandfather,
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph2">Joseph Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> dated 23. July 1731—the copy of which,
							without probate, and unexecuted is in the hand-writing of his Son, my
							Grandfather— And of my Great-grandfather <persRef ref="adams-joseph3"
								>Joseph Adams Senior</persRef>;—an Office Copy, attested by <persRef
								ref="cooper-william">William Cooper</persRef> Register of Probate—
							This Will is dated 18. July 1694— On each of these three Wills, is an
							endorsement in my fathers hand-writing, subscribed with his name, dated
							Boston April 29. 1774. giving short notices of the Testators, and
							marking where they lived in Braintree— Under which, upon each are the
							following Lines</p>
						<lg>
							<l>What Fortune had he pray? His own:</l>
						<l>And better got, than Bestia’s from the Throne.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>On the Will of Joseph Adams Senior, is another endorsement; without date
							but evidently written at the same time with the others, tracing from
							this Joseph Adams the descent of <persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel
								Adams</persRef>, then a Representative from Boston, and Clerk of the
							House in the Colonial Legislature; with a high eulogy upon him as a
							writer, politician and patriot— These papers awaken again an ardent
							curiosity to know more of those forefathers who lived, and died in
							obscure and humble life; but every one of whom from the first Settlement
							of the Country, raised numerous families of children, and had something
							to leave by Will— There could indeed be nothing found of them but the

						<p>The President of Harvard University <persRef ref="kirkland-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirkland</persRef> came from
							Cambridge, and preached two Sermons, occasional on the decease of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>— That of the morning
							was from Proverbs 10.7.— “The memory of the just is blessed:” and was a
							warm, animated and affectionate tribute to the character of my father.
							It was a discourse, well composed, written in an elegant style, which
							after enumerating the various sources from which blessedness becomes an
							attribute of the memory of the just, applied them to the character,
							conduct, and life of the deceased. There was no particular allusion to
							any special incident of his history—nothing merely chronological—but the
							distinguishing traits of his character, were presented in general
							language—pointing rather to the results than to the facts by which their
							progress was indicated— Many parts of it were to me, deeply pathetic,
							but towards the close he introduced a few sentences of direct reference
							to my almost adored <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>, which
							agitated me more than I was aware it was in the power of human speech to
							do— He also concluded in a very affecting manner, by a quotation of that
							eloquent appeal to the virtue and patriotism, of the youth of America,
							in the last Letter of the Defence of the Constitutions.— The Afternoon
							Sermon was from Hebrews 11.13. “These all died in faith, not having
							received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded
							of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
							pilgrims on the earth.” It was a continuation of the same subject as in
							the morning; but with reference to the prospects and promises of a
							future life— Less pathetic, but still more solemn than the discourse of
							the morning— The Doctor dined with us, and also spent the afternoon here
							from the issue of the service, till near Sunset, when he went to pass
							the Night at <persRef ref="amory-sarah">his Sisters</persRef> at Milton—
							He promised me copies of both his Sermons, and told me that the American
							Academy of Arts and Sciences, had elected him to deliver a discourse
							before them, upon this Event; at a Meeting to be held on the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October, my father’s birth-day, and
							he asked me many questions concerning his literary and scientific tastes
							and pursued, on which I gave him all the information in my power. He is
							going for some weeks on a visit to Utica, in the State of New-York.
								<persRef ref="whitney-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

							provided in part, and of some proceedings of the Inhabitants towards
							commencing it— She suggested the idea of having, apartments in it for

									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Greenleaf’s</persRef>, but he was
							gone out of Town— I gave my brother my List of the Deeds of real Estate

							long conversation of two hours with him, concerning what is to be done
							by him on the final disposal of this Estate— He is quite unprepared for

								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> is now making a

							Journal, kept from Friday 13. February 1778. when we embarked from the

								ref="tucker-samuel">Samuel Tucker</persRef>, till the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1779. when we were on board the
							Frigate Alliance at the mouth of the Loire, expecting to return in her
							to the United States— The journal is irregularly kept, at broken
							intervals, intermixed with drafts of Letters, exercises of writing in
							French, copies of French invitation Cards, and reflections written on
							the spur of the occasion, expressing the strongly excited feelings of
							the moment, on the whole deeply interesting to me, and leaving only the
							regret that it was not more regularly kept and longer continued—but
							altogether unfit for public inspection, and such as ought to be reserved
							from all eyes but those of affectionate descendents— My own Journals
							will be of the same character. I have lived in times less momentous in
							themselves, and have recorded much more— I have not however been able to
							keep an uninterrupted Journal. The Letter Books of my Father, will
							require much chronological arrangement— In his Travels and Removals from
							place to place, he had many different Books— Two thirds of them are not
							one quarter filled, and some of them contain only two or three Letters—
							In 1829. if by the Will and blessing of God, I am here and in health, I
							propose to take up these books in the Spirit of filial piety, due to
							such a father, and may no aid from above then be wanting!</p>

								ref="adamd-thomas">my brother</persRef>, his son <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">T. B.</persRef> and my sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">G. W.</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to Dedham— We stopp’d at <persRef
								ref="alden-francis">Alden’s</persRef> Tavern, where about 200
							persons, inhabitants of that place and of the other Towns of the County
							were introduced to me. Between 3. and 4. we went in procession to the
							Meeting House, where the funeral Solemnities were performed— <persRef
								ref="boyle-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyle</persRef> an
							Episcopal Clergyman read Select portions of Scripture— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi>    made the opening and <persRef
								ref="white-john7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>
							the concluding Prayer— Two Anthems, a Dirge, and an original occasional
							Hymn, written by <persRef ref="mann-herman">Herman Mann</persRef>, were
							performed by a Choir of Singers, accompanied by the Organ, and an
							Eulogy, upon <persRef ref="adams-john">John Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef>, was pronounced by
								<persRef ref="mann-horace">Horace Mann</persRef>, of splendid
							composition and lofty Eloquence— The last Anthem was <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> Dying Christian— The house was
							full, without being crowded; at least half the company were Ladies—
							After returning in procession to the Tavern, I thanked the several
							performers of the day and we came back to Quincy— The day was fine— The
							judge of Probate <persRef ref="robbins-edward">Robbins</persRef> was
							there, and said he would be ready to receive <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							and me, at nine O’Clock to-morrow Morning— In the Evening I called at
								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.
								Beale’s</persRef> to enquire if he would wish to go to Dedham as a
							witness to the Will; but he was not at home— I read to the family
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Everett’s</persRef> Oration delivered at Cambridge on the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month— It is like all his
							writings full of thought, of argument, and of Eloquence—intermixed with
							a little humorous levity, and a few paradoxical fancies— There is at
							this Time in this Commonwealth a practical School of popular Oratory, of
							which I believe myself to be the principal founder, by my own Orations
							and Lectures, and which with the blessing of him who reigns, will
							redound to the honour and advantage of this Nation, and to the benefit
							of Mankind.</p>
