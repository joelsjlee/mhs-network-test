						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fessenden</persRef>, a
							Tutor at Cambridge, preached for <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>—this morning from
							Ephesians 4:1. “I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that
							ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney himself administered the
							communion, of which I for the first time in my life partook. The form of
							admission to the Church was simple— Before commencing the service M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney said that the persons who had
							expressed their wish to join in the communion might present themselves,
							upon which each of us rose in his or her place, and he reminded us of
							the engagements implied in the participation of this rite—a sincere
							belief in the divine Mission of Christ, and a fixed purpose of living
							according to the rules of his Gospel.— He then proceeded with the
							solemnity, which was over in about half an hour. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fessenden preached again in the afternoon from Daniel 6.10.
							“Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into the
							house; and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem, he
							kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks
							before his God, as he did aforetime.” This discourse was more elaborate
							than that of the morning: very well written; and closing with a passage
							really eloquent— It was upon the perseverance of pious Men in their
							religious sentiments under persecution— After the service, <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							called upon me, and I communicated to him all the papers I had been
							preparing for the Settlement of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Estate; which he approved— But it will yet take
							two or three days to complete them— He agreed to come out from Boston on
							Wednesday Evening and execute them all; and then to go with me on
							Thursday Morning, with the account to the judge of Probate at Dedham. I
							have been engaged without intermission many days in the preparation of
							these papers, and have found the necessity of changing several after
							they had been written and copied— I have purchased more than four fifths
							of my father’s Estate, which I hope will afford an asylum to my last
							days. My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> came out from
							Boston, and returned again in the Evening. He began the packing up of
							Chests with papers, to be deposited in the vaults of the Branch Bank of
							the United States at Boston— I propose to place them all in six Chests
							painted blue, with the initials of my name upon their lids; and
							numbered. They will contain the papers of my father and mother; and my
							own of a date preceding my Mission to Russia in 1809. I have not yet had
							an hour of time to examine my father’s papers. <persRef
								ref="dearborn-henry2">General H. A. S. Dearborn</persRef> came from
							Roxbury, and spent an hour of the Evening with me— I wrote a Letter to
								<persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Wint</persRef>, and one to <persRef ref="johnson-abigail">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Johnson</persRef> of Utica, to be
							signed by the Executors— <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My
								brother</persRef> has also much occupied in copying the Papers.</p>

								<persRef ref="adams-john">father</persRef> and <persRef

							450 dollars a year exclusive of the House and Garden. The whole farm
							will cost me 22000 dollars and will not yield 3 per cent interest by the
							year— But the gradual increase in the value of Lands will probably be an
							equivalent for the other 3 per Cent— I called this afternoon at <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							the Minister, and returned him his old Church Record Book. I asked the
							Copy of his Sermon, preaching at the interment of my father, for

						<p>After a short walk, awaiting day-light, and the journal of yesterday, I
							was occupied the whole day and evening, in settling accounts and demands
							upon <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate, and in
							preparing the papers for exhibition to the judge of Probate— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel

								>Brown</persRef> came out to solicit a remission of a penalty,
							incurred by a British vessel at Philadelphia, <persRef ref="u">Captain
								M’Leod</persRef>, for bringing more passengers than are allowed by
							Law— I had written on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September
							a Letter to the <persRef key="rush-richard">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> on the subject, which I read to them, and with
							which they were satisfied— <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi

							of Bristol, Rhode-Island, who came to solicit for <persRef ref="u">his

								ref="turner-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner</persRef>
							to make a suit of Clothes for <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> the Minister, and
							told him that my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> would
							pay his bill on account of the Executors of my father’s Will— <persRef
								ref="brown-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John Mills
								Brown</persRef> came with papers relating to a Patent steering Mill
							of his Invention, which he wished me to examine— He said he had written
							to me about it last May, and sent me a Model, which he wished to have
							examined by the Commissioners of the Navy.— He will come to me again at
							Boston next Friday— I settled Accounts with Deacon Savil, and paid him
							for his management of the farm this year according to his agreement with
							my father— <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foster</persRef> called only, as having attended a Meeting of the
							Directors of Neponset Bridge. <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Felt</persRef> of Hamilton, made a
							short evening visit; and <persRef ref="bass-jonathan">Deacon
								Bass</persRef>, came and settled his note, which I had found, and
							his account against my fathers Estate— For the excess of the Note beyond
							the account he gave me a new note to the Executors— My Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> came out from Boston, about Noon,
							and returned in the Evening, much and very effectively engaged in the
							interval, assisting me in the settlement of accounts, and preparation of
							papers for the judge of Probate— Although there is nothing very
							complicated in this Administration, yet in the number of accounts
							connected with the sales we find it difficult to keep them all in exact
							order— I agreed with my <persRef ref="adams-thomas">brother</persRef>
							for his occupying this House till the first of April next. Began a

								Quincy</persRef> came out at eleven— We executed and acknowledged
							before my <persRef ref="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> ten Instruments
							Four Deeds from the Executors to me— Three of them of the Lands on
							parchment, and one of the two Pews and the Tomb, on paper— One Bond four
							mortgages from me to the Executors, and a Power of Attorney to Josiah
							Quincy to act for me, irrevocable as to any action or suit against me
							upon the Bond and mortgages— We signed also a general Account of
							Administration, two separate Accounts of Expenditures, and my particular
							Account with the Executors. Also Letters to <persRef
								ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> de
								Wint</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-abigail">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Johnson</persRef> of Utica, <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, informing them of the amount
							assigned to each of them under the devises in their favour. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy dined with us and immediately after
							dinner we rode to Dedham. My brother also went there upon business of
							his own. He laid before the judge all the Accounts, and exhibited to him
							all the vouchers for which he enquired, and which were chiefly the
							Accounts of the several Sales. After examining them he returned to me
							all the vouchers, retaining only the four Accounts signed by the
							Executors— The Deeds were likewise all exhibited to him, and he made
							some question as to the conveyances being to and from myself, in my
							individual capacity, and as Executor, but did not insist upon the
							objection— He said he supposed other Deeds might be executed if found
							necessary; and he did not think M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
							could make the conveyances alone— He administered to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and me the Oath that the account we
							had rendered was just and true— I presented the additional inventory of
							3. Acres of the Quincy lot estimated by the appraisers, which he took;
							and the list of Books divided between my brother and me and of which I
							have taken his half at his own apprizement approved by the appraisers—
							The judge said it would not be necessary that this should be returned to
							him at all as a part of the Estate; it having been disposed of
							conformably to the Will— From the Probate Office we went into the
							Registry of Deeds, and left there to be recorded the four Deeds of the
							Executors to me the Bond, two mortgages and Power from me which are to
							be delivered to and kept by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy—and he
							took the two Mortgages of Estates in Boston, to be recorded there— We
							called on <persRef ref="dowse-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dowse</persRef>, and saw him <persRef ref="dowse-sarah">his

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Shaw</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dowse is much out of health— M<hi

							to Boston, and I with my brother to Quincy— <persRef ref="marston-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Marston</persRef> his daughters
							and <persRef ref="harrod-ann">Ann Harrod</persRef> were here in the

							them; and then up to the ledge. We passed the spot where they were
							digging the cellar of two Stone houses which the company are about to
							build, for the workmen occupied at the ledge, and which Perkins told me
							would be finished in a Month from this time— We saw the model of the
							Bunker Hill Monument, which is a long pyramid, to repose upon a platform
							and deep-laid basement, without pedestal. He shewed us also two of the
							Cars, to be used for transporting the Stone, the first of which cost 750
							dollars and the second not more than 250— This is the first railway
							constructed in the United States, and if successful will lead to many
							others— Its consequences are of great importance, and deeply connected
							with the prosperity of Boston, and of Quincy for this and succeeding
							ages— My own fortunes, for the remainder of my days, and those of my
							children, are also implicated in it; and all the purposes upon which my
							mind retires for relief to the closing years of life are blended with
							it— We returned home to dinner— In the afternoon, <persRef
								ref="smith-joseph4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Smith</persRef> of Warren, Rhode-Island came, with several
							introductory Letters, to solicit some change in the Custom-House

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf</persRef> came to inform me

							Colonies, as he said, in both Hemispheres, after the first of December
							next. It is a new trial, through which we are to pass, and the issue of

							the Georgia War was extinct, there must be something to stir the blood
							of the public, and it might as well be this as anything else— My Son

						<p>I left for the last time the dwelling House of <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef>, in which he had chiefly resided for nearly
							forty years; and entirely for the last twenty-five— I left it with an
							anxious and consoling hope of returning to it as to my own, probably
							within three short years, and of finding within the means and
							opportunity of employing the remnant of time allotted to me on earth, in
							exercises of filial reverence and affection, of usefulness to my
							children, of benevolence to the neighbourhood of my own and my father’s
							nativity, and of ultimate improvement to the condition of my Country— To
							as much of this as may obtain the approbation of higher power, I implore
							the directing and effecting hand of Providence— For so much of it as may
							be destined to disappointment, I pray to be prepared and resigned. I was
							engaged from my rising hour till eleven in packing for departure. My Son
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Clark</persRef>
							came to Boston in the Morning Stage— I have leased the house and garden
							till the first of April to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother</persRef>, and left the farm in charge of <persRef
								ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef>, to whom I have agreed
							also to let the farm on lease for three or five years, from that Time— I
							took leave of my brother and his family, his daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> being yet confined in bed
							with a fever, and I came with <persRef ref="pote-william">William
								Pote</persRef> to Boston. I left my small Trunk at George’s chamber
							at <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Welsh’s</persRef>, and went to <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> B. T. Pickman’s</persRef>
							where <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> came from
							the Exchange Hotel yesterday— She was riding out, and I immediately
							afterwards met her with <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet
								Welsh</persRef> in the Carriage— I went to my Son George’s Office,
							and there found his partner <persRef ref="kinsman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kinsman</persRef>, and a Trustee
							process was served upon me as Executor against <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>, for the
							attachment of his portion of my fathers Estate— I then attended at the
							U.S. Branch Bank, and executed with <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> the transfer of 6 per
							Cents from the Executors to me; and I made drafts on the Branch at
							Washington for the discharge of my own current expenses— Thence I went
							to the Exchange Hotel, and discharged all the bills to be paid before my

								<persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							took a light breakfast with <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet
								Welsh</persRef>, and took leave of the <persRef ref="welsh-thomas2"
								>Alderman Thomas</persRef>. The Doctor himself is at Wiscasset— We
							started just after Sun rise, my Son George being with me, and <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> remaining to go with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">his mother</persRef> next week. We came
							by the same road that we had travelled about this time last year, and as
							then, breakfasted at <persRef ref="stratton-unknown"
								>Stratton’s</persRef> in Watertown, and dined at <persRef
								ref="holman-amory">Holman’s</persRef> in Bolton— We had the most
							beautiful weather all day, and reached <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s</persRef> House just at
							Sunset— Found him in comfortable health and very cheerful Spirits, and
							had a pleasant evening with him— The day had passed almost imperceptibly
							in conversation with my Son George, upon my own future purposes and upon
							his prospects. The decease of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and the arrangements which I have been making for
							the execution of his Will, have formed a new and important aera in my
							life— It behooves me henceforward to devote the remainder of my time to
							preparations for my own exit from the stage— To this all my thoughts
							have tended since I last came from Washington; and to this all my
							anticipations for the future must lean— The co-operation of my Sons is
							indispensable to the accomplishment of any of my purposes with useful
							result, and among my earnest wishes, is one that George should soon
							connect himself judiciously in marriage— The state of his health, which
							is very indifferent forms for the present a serious obstacle to this
							project and there may be others in his temper and disposition— Favoured
							beyond measure as I have been by the smiles of heaven hitherto through
							life, very few of the blessings I have enjoyed, have been owing to any
							foresight of mine— Almost all my schemes have been disconcerted—and the
							great favours I have received have been unexpected, and with little or
							no agency of my own— Of these profuse bounties of Providence, it were
							presumption even to ask the continuance— From public life I have little
							left to hope, and nothing upon which to rely— My private duties have
							become complicated, and require much deliberation; much assistance, and
							much fortuitous co-operation— All that I am to expect from my children
							is uncertainty; with a few gleams of hope, and many foretastes of
							discouragement. George’s health is yet very precarious; his Spirits
							dejected; his self distrust painfully predominant, and my own
							anticipations at this crisis of my earthly destiny full of apprehension
							and of anguish— I commence my return to Washington with an aching Heart—
							But why art thou cast down my Soul? and why art thou disquieted within
							me?— Hope thou in him—</p>

						<p>I attended morning and afternoon at the Public Worship of the
							Congregational Church, and heard <persRef ref="clarke-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef>, their Pastor, in the
							forenoon from 1. Peter 1.8. “Whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom
							though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
							unspeakable and full of glory.” It was their Communion day; and the
							discourse was an urgent and animated exhortation to Christian heads of
							families to join in full communion with the Church— Members of other
							Churches in regular standing were invited to remain and partake of the
							Communion which I did. The ceremony was altogether similar to that of
							the last Sunday at <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whitney’s</persRef>, though rather longer— The
							communicants were not so many— I walked from the Church to <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston’s</persRef> and very soon returned to the afternoon’s
							service— The text was from Galatians 4:18. But it is “good to be
							zealously affected, always in a good thing.” The subject was in
							continuation of the morning’s discourse, and the recommendation of zeal
							in the Christian cause was urged with all the ardour of sincerity. There
							was an occasional anthem sung in the Morning, and another in the
							afternoon; and both times the whole Congregation rose as I entered the
							Meeting-House, with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston— There were
							three publishments of intentions of marriage—one baptism of a female
							child, and a notice given of a funeral to-morrow afternoon— We dined at
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s, after all the religious
							services of the day were over, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark
							the Minister came and spent the Evening with us— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Boylston in the course of the day mentioned incidentally
							that he was born in 1749. His Son, <persRef ref="boylston-john"
								>John</persRef> dined with us, and his grandson <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward2">Ward</persRef>, now a lad of eleven years of
							age, was here by leave of absence from his School in Lancaster. Two
							other and younger grandchildren were also here this day; a boy of 7
							named <persRef ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas</persRef>, and a girl of
							five named <persRef ref="boylston-alicia2">Alicia</persRef>. He has one
							other Grand-child, an infant two years old— He told me he should leave
							to them his large Estate at this place, and intimated that he should
							recommend them in some measure to my care or advice for their education—
							He is to remove on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month
							to his place at Jamaica-Plains, Roxbury for the Winter. This mode of
							life he has now pursued about twelve or fourteen years passing the
							Summer here, and the Winter at Roxbury— He shewed me this day a plan for
							a Town Hall which he has had drawn—and for the building of which he has
							left or intends leaving a bequest— It is also to be used for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke’s congregation (only) instead of
							the meeting-house, in foul weather during the Winter; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston intends that a Tomb should be
							constructed under it, in which his remains shall be deposited— He
							remarked upon the similitude of this design, with that which I have
							formed with reference to my <persRef ref="adams-abigail;adams-john"

						<p><date>9. V:15.</date> Ride to the Sterling Ponds</p>
						<p>I wrote till breakfast time, and examined a small stuffed porcupine or
							hedgehog, which was killed on Saturday, on one of the Hills at the side
							of Wachusett, or as <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Boylston</persRef> now calls it Mount Adams. It weighed
							about 22 pounds, and was probably not half-grown— Its quills were sharp
							as needles, but imperfectly hardened into bone. This animal is scarcely
							known in the neighbourhood, and was a solitary Stray upon the mountains—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston bought him for half a dollar
							of the man who killed him— After breakfast we viewed the Cattle that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston and <persRef
								ref="boylston-john">his Son</persRef> are sending to the Show at
							Worcester, and then I took a ride with him and my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, of about sixteen Miles, round
							the Ponds in Sterling, which are seen about E.S.E. of the house. The
							road to them is chiefly the same as that we had travelled in 1821 going
							to Lancaster; it comes out at the Sterling Meeting house, and the road
							back is that by which we come from Boston— The Country is covered much
							with Wood, not very fertile, nor highly cultivated. Yet neither barren,
							nor neglected— The woods are Oak, Walnut, Chesnut, Maple, White Pine and
							Birch; none of very large size— We had beautiful weather with the clear
							autumnal sky— On returning at One O’Clock, I found there had been here a
							Committee of Citizens of the Town of Worcester— They came again shortly
							after— <persRef ref="fiske-oliver">Oliver Fiske</persRef>, my old
							Classmate, <persRef ref="burnside-samuel">Samuel M. Burnside</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="salisbury-stephen">Stephen Salisbury jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>, and delivered to me an
							invitation in behalf of Citizens of the Town of Worcester, to a Public
							Dinner on Thursday; which with suitable acknowledgments I declined— The
							Committee remained to dine with us; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Burnside gave me a Letter from <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, containing for myself and my family a friendly
							invitation to his House while I remain at Worcester, which I accepted—
								<persRef ref="clarke-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clark</persRef> the Minister also dined here, but retired at three
							to attend the funeral of a child. The Committee remained an hour later,
							and took a Moonlight Evening for their return home. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef ref="clarke-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Clarke</persRef> were here again in
							the Evening, and <persRef ref="irving-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Irving</persRef>— I had less time for writing than
							I desired, and the cold North western breeze which came up yesterday
							morning, and continues, has brought me the unwelcome visit of a sharp
							Lumbago. I had a couple of handfulls of chesnuts gathered to take with
							me, to be planted at Washington, and part of them to be taken by George
							and planted at Quincy. I took a warm draught on going this Evening to
							bed.</p>

						<p>Morning till eleven employed in writing. <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston</persRef> accompanied

								Welles</persRef> of Boston, and several persons of distinction from
							the town and County, formed the Company. I had great satisfaction in
							meeting my Classmates Putnam and <persRef ref="fiske-oliver"
								>Fiske</persRef>. In the evening we went by invitation to a Meeting
							of the Society of Odd Fellows—An Association of the members of the Bar,
							convivial and Literary, who have assumed that title with a view to
							infuse wit and humour into their proceedings. The Meeting was at
								<persRef ref="u">Stockwell’s</persRef> Tavern— There was an Oration
							by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barton</persRef>, a
							Supper, and a Poem afterwards by    <persRef ref="lincoln-john">Lincoln
								a brother</persRef> of the Governor— The Oration was cheerful, but
							grave— The poem in irregular verse was gay and humorous— The proceedings
							of the Society were of the same character— They elected an Orator and a
							Poet for the next Anniversary which is to be in April next, for they
							have several Anniversaries every year— The Poet declined the task
							assigned to him; which he said the Society knew he had done before. But
							he repeated the Offer, which he had made of writing every alternate line
							of a Poem, if brother <persRef ref="burnside-samuel">Burnside</persRef>
							would write the corresponding line— They had elected <persRef ref="u"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell</persRef> of New-York
							an honorary member of the Society, and shewed a Letter of acceptance
							from him commencing with a hieroglyphic representation of Oddity.
							<unclear>symbols</unclear> There was a gigantic Jews harp on the table, and the figure of
							an owl, with glass eyes, and a label suspended to its bill, with the
							inscription—And while we are merry, let’s be wise. <persRef
								ref="symmes-john">Captain Symmes</persRef> was proposed and
							unanimously elected an honorary member of the Society—and several very
							odd Resolutions were offered, respecting his projected settlement in the
							interior of the Earth. A reconsideration of one Resolution was offered;
							but the President declared it to be a standing Rule of the Society never
							to reconsider anything. After two or three Toasts succeeding the Supper
							had been given, at about eleven O’Clock I retired with Governor Lincoln,
							and came to lodge at his house.</p>

						<p><date>11. VI.</date> Worcester Cattle Show.</p>
						<p>The morning began with a ploughing match, by which a field, near the
							meeting house, of an eighth of an acre was ploughed up. There were nine
							ploughs, five or six of them with two yoke of oxen, a ploughman and a
							driver, the rest with one yoke of oxen each, a ploughman, and no driver—
							The ground was divided into equal parts, and the work was performed in
							about half an hour— The premium was obtained by one of the single teams;
							and the object of the match was to ascertain the comparative efficacy of
							single and double yokes, with and without a driver, and also the
							comparative merit of the ploughs of different construction with and
							without a wheel and a coulter— The issue of this experiment was
							favourable to the simple plough, and the single team— After this we
							returned to the Governor’s, and thence went in procession to the Meeting
							House, where after an address read by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Governor Lincoln</persRef>, as President of the Agricultural
							Society, and an excellent prayer by a Minister of some neighbouring
							Town, named <persRef ref="u">Nelson</persRef>, an Oration was delivered
							by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Washburn</persRef>,
							well written, well delivered, and well received— The Governor announced
							in his address that the President of the United States, The Chief
							Justice of the Supreme Court of the <hi rend="strikethrough">United
								States</hi> Commonwealth, <persRef ref="parker-isaac">Isaac
								Parker</persRef>, the judges <persRef ref="putnam-samuel"

								ref="coffin-isaac2">Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin</persRef>, and some
							others had been this morning elected honorary members of the
							Agricultural Society of Worcester County— We then visited and
							perambulated the penns in which the Cattle were enclosed— There were
							several hundreds of very fine oxen, bulls, cows and calves. The largest
							ox, weighing 2450 pounds. Very few Merino Sheep, in no wise remarkable;
							a Show of swine not more distinguished, one large and handsome Saddle
							Horse, and one Dray-horse of English breed, imported by Sir Isaac
							Coffin, and now with a colt. At the invitation of <persRef
								ref="bigelow-abijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> the Clerk of the Supreme Court, we stopped and
							took a collation at his house; viewing at the same time the draught
							match of oxen, one yoke to a Cart drawing up hill a weight of lb 5000.
							Thence we returned to the Governor’s, and marched again in procession to
							the town Hall, to a dinner of about 120 persons— After dinner, were
							merry and pointed toasts, not too numerous, and mine with a return of my
							thanks was “the Dairies, Nurseries and Schools of the town and County of
							Worcester; replenishment to and from them all[”]— We viewed the Show of
							manufactures which was small—that of butter and cheese, indifferent—
							Then heard the reports of the Committee, awarding the premiums— Attended
							at 7. in the Evening an Oratorio at the Meeting House, and heard much of
								<persRef ref="handel-george">Handel’s</persRef> sublimity and the
							Star of Bethlehem, sung by <persRef ref="u">Miss Kimberley</persRef>. At
							ten I returned to the Governor’s and retired— He, his family, and
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went to a Ball, from
							which they returned at 2. A.M.</p>

								<persRef ref="lincoln-penelope">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lincoln</persRef> at 7 this morning, and came seven Miles to

							dined when passing from Princeton to Providence with <persRef
								ref="boylston-john">John Boylston</persRef> the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October 1823. but not kept by the
							same man— The name of the present keeper is <persRef ref="u"
								>Baker</persRef>. We found here <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi>    Dexter</persRef> who introduced
							himself to me as a Son of <persRef ref="dexter-aaron">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Aaron Dexter</persRef>, and his
								<persRef ref="dexter-rebecca">wife</persRef>, as a daughter of my
							old friend <persRef ref="amory-thomas">T. C. Amory</persRef> now
							deceased. They gave the room in which they were at breakfast up to us—
							He told me he had arrived last Evening, and had come to reside at
							Grafton, as the Agent of a company at Boston, who were establishing here
							a manufacture of flax— From Grafton we proceeded through Uxbridge to
							Slatersville, where we dined— The keeper of this house, named <persRef
								ref="u">Anderson</persRef> would receive nothing for our
							Entertainment— The place looks less thriving than it did last year, some
							of the buildings having since that time been destroyed by fire— There is
							nevertheless a large stone house which we visited, and where we saw
							three hundred spindles of a cotton factory in full operation— There is
							also another stone building of the same or large size now erecting— The
							spindles, and the modes of picking, combing, and spinning into yarn the
							cotton wool, are the same as those I had seen in Russia and at Ghent.
							The attendance on the spindles, is all by girls— After dinner we came
							17. Miles to Providence, and took our lodgings at <persRef
								ref="blake-unknown2">Blake’s</persRef>, or the Franklin house— We
							arrived just before dusk, and found here <persRef ref="payne-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Payne</persRef> and his
								<persRef ref="u">wife</persRef>, who had just arrived from Newport,
							on their return to Boston, and with whom I spent pleasantly part of the
							Evening. Governor Lincoln had requested my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, to write to him by the first
							mail, the substance of the few words with which I introduced my toast at
							yesterday’s dinner. George wrote them this evening at my dictation— I
							said that in returning thanks to the company for the honour they had
							done me by the preceding toast, I availed myself of the opportunity to
							add my further thanks for the invitation of the Trustees of the
							Agricultural Society of Worcester County, to attend at this
							commemoration, and for the further honour they had done me by electing
							me an honorary member of the Society— That a large portion of my life
							had been past, in absence from my native state—an absence which would
							almost always have been involuntary but for the consideration that it
							was in the service of the Country. That I had nevertheless from my
							earliest years heard much of the town and County of Worcester— Of their
							farms, of their farmers, and especially of their Schools— That to such
							Instructions as those, the results of which we were witnessing if I
							could contribute nothing else, they should at least have the tribute of
							my best wishes—and in that Spirit gave the toast— George wrote also by
							my direction to <persRef ref="binns-john">J. Binns</persRef> at
							Philadelphia, saying I expected to be there next Monday the 16<hi

								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Payne</persRef>, and taking
							leave of them about nine A.M. proceeded by Land to Newport. I had only
							one morning visitant at Providence, <persRef ref="barton-william3"
								>General Barton</persRef>, an old Revolutionary Officer— We came
							through Warren and Bristol two miles South of which is a ferry— It blew
							a heavy gale, and we effected the passage of the ferry with some
							difficulty and danger. The ferryman thought they could not manage the
							horse-boat, and came over for us, with the Sail-boat. To this, my
							Coachman, <persRef ref="divoll-timothy">Timothy Divoll</persRef>, was
							very unwilling to trust his horses— But there was no other alternative,
							and into the Sail-boat they went— About the middle of the passage, the
							waves ran high; the wind blew a tempest— The boat was tossed up till one
							of the horses lost his centre of gravity. His hind feet were tripped up,
							and he came down upon his hams— In his fright he recovered himself by a
							violent effort, and then reared up with a struggle to plunge over the
							side of the boat— Divoll who held him by the bridle had just strength
							enough to bring him down again upon his feet, when his hind legs again
							gave way, and he recovered himself by a second violent struggle;
							fortunately the boat had in the mean time got over the middle of the
							river into smoother water, and we effected the passage, without
							calamitous accident; but I had not for many Months; perhaps for years
							been in such imminent danger; and for our preservation from it I arrived
							with suitable impressions, on the other shore; reflecting upon what a
							slender thread human life depends, and how incessantly it needs the
							guardian care of superior power— From Portsmouth, on the South side of
							the river we came to Newport, over a beautiful, and well cultivated

							Cahoone</p>
						<p>The gale continued, all this Morning, and the Steam-boat Fulton, which
							should have passed up yesterday afternoon from New-York to Providence,
							made not her appearance— In her regular course she should have left
							Providence at 3 this afternoon returning to New-York, and my
							arrangements were made for embarking in her as she would touch at
							Newport about Sunset. Disappointed in this expectation I had a prospect
							of being detained two or three days; but the Revenue Cutter Vigilant was
							here; and her <persRef ref="cahoone-john">Captain Cahoone</persRef>, and
							the Collector, <persRef ref="ellery-christopher">Ellery</persRef>, urged
							me to take passage in her: to which from the necessity of the case I
							assented— But my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> being
							yet unwell, and the weather threatening a boisterous passage to New-York
							I advised him to return, with the Carriage which had brought us from
							Boston— He left me accordingly about 8. O’Clock, immediately after
							breakfast; intending to go this day to Trenton, and to reach Boston
							tomorrow. After he was gone I received a succession of visitors and with

								<persRef ref="collins-charles2">Collins</persRef>, the late <persRef

								>Captain Northam</persRef>, I visited the public Library, a very
							neat small building of simple but elegant architecture, containing about
							2500 volumes— The State-house in which the Legislature meet when
							assembled at Newport— A newly established manufacture of lace, where I
							found sixty or seventy young women and girls at work— They had sent a
							present of a Cap to my wife, and I took for her a Lady’s dress, which
							had been exhibited at a Show of manufactures last week— We called also
							at the houses of the late Governor Gibbs; of the present Lieutenant
							Governor Collins, and of <persRef ref="vernon-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vernon</persRef>, who has a valuable
							collection of Paintings, by some of the celebrated Masters of the
							Italian and Flemish Schools. At 11. according to appointment with
								<persRef ref="totten-joseph">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Totten</persRef>, I crossed the harbour in a boat and was shewn by
							him, the works of the fortifications commenced at Fort Adams. The plan
							of which appeared to me excellent. I had not time to visit Fort Wolcott
							though invited by <persRef ref="u">Major Mason</persRef> the Officer
							commanding there— We returned from the works at Brenton’s Point, in
							Carriages, by Land, and I received numerous visitors till about 3. when
							I sat down with a company of about 50 persons to a dinner to which I had
							been informally invited— I called in at the Bedchamber of old <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Townsend</persRef> father of
								<persRef ref="u">the present keeper</persRef> of the house now
							upwards of 80 years of age, and paralytic, bedridden: but who remembered
							that I had been at his house 37. years ago in 1789— After a short but
							jovial dinner, I embarked in the Cutter with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ellery, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Collins and Captain
							Northam, and at 5 in the afternoon, we were underway— At the same time
							the Sky became clear and the Sea Smooth— The Evening was fair, with a
							light breeze, and we passed the Steam-Boat Fulton, off Point Judith.</p>

							deep, we are witnessing led me to reflections and hopes, that I was
							willing to indulge, and suitable to the day. On rising this morning I
							found the vessel was off New-Haven, sailing about seven miles an hour,
							with a very light but favorable breeze. The Sun rose in Splendor, and

							without weariness, conversing occasionally with my fellow passengers,
							observing the villages and steeples as we passed along the Connecticut,
							and Long-Island Shores, and upon the East-river, and the numerous
							coasting vessels sailing up and down the Sound; of which there were
							never less than twenty in sight; and skimming on the surface of Captain
							Cahoone’s Library— I passed from the Wars of the Jews, to Pope’s
							Eloisa—and from Pope to the life of Burns which at last riveted my
							attention— And I read how the ploughman bard was ruined and destroyed by
							his greatness—the Wreck of his own fame. Passing from the Cottage to the
							tables and Castles of the great and wealthy, and sinking from contented
							poverty, into luxury, discontent, habitual drunkenness, and untimely
							death.</p>

						<p><date>16— VI.</date> Steam Boat Linnaeus from Flushing. New-York.</p>
						<p>There was rain in the Night, and the wind this morning was against the
							Cutter for proceeding to New-York. The tide would not make in her favour
							for the passage through Hell-gate before ten O’Clock, and there was no
							prospect of her reaching New-York before noon— <persRef
								ref="cahoone-john">Captain Cahoone</persRef> therefore sent his
							Boat, and afterwards went in her himself to engage the Steam-boat
							Linnaeus from Flushing, to stop and take me on board. Half an hour after
							the boat was gone, the Steam-boat Fulton passed by us on her way to
							New-York: she had been up to Providence, and returned from thence, since
							we passed her, Saturday Evening, off Point Judith. <persRef
								ref="bunker-thomas">Captain Bunker</persRef> came on board the
							Cutter, and invited me to go in to the Fulton, which I declined, because
							having sent to ask a passage, in the Linnaeus, I would not take the
							chance of disappointing her Captain, should he in consequence of my
							application come out of his way to take me up— One of his passengers in
							the first instance objected to the delay of stopping for me; fearing to
							lose the chance of forwarding Letters by the Packet for Liverpool which
							was to sail at ten— <persRef ref="peck-elijah">Captain Peck</persRef>
							therefore refused to stay for me; and, was proceeding on his way, when
							his passenger relented, and he came round for me— I took leave of
							Captain Cahoone with thanks, and went on board the Linnaeus, with
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef ref="ellery-christopher"
								>Ellery</persRef>, <persRef ref="collins-charles2">Collins</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">Northam</persRef>. We landed at New-York about ten;
							and I walked to the City Hotel, where those Gentlemen took leave of me—
							I made compensation to Captain Cahoone, for the expenses incident to my
							passage with him, and for the trouble given to his crew; but Captain
							Peck of the Linnaeus refused to take any thing— I found on board the
							Linnaeus <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> of New-York, who informed me he had a dividend
							to pay on the Estate of <persRef ref="bird-robert">Robert Bird</persRef>
							and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> He came and paid it to me at the
							City Hotel—901. dollars 95 Cents—which belong to the Estate of <persRef

								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> at the City Hotel— They had come
							all the way from Boston, by Land, and arrived here on Saturday— I

						<p>Though I rose as the Clock struck five, I barely succeeded to get on
							board the Steam-boat Thistle, <persRef ref="u">Captain

							The passage to Philadelphia was divided into three equal parts of four
							hours each—Steamboat from New-York, to New Brunswick four hours, from
							six to ten— Then Carriage from Brunswick to Trenton—from ten to two—
							Steamboat Trenton, from two to six, when she arrived at Philadelphia— I

								Read</persRef>, also of South-Carolina, with <persRef ref="u">his
								Son</persRef>, a beautiful boy in his eleventh year, but weighing
							132 pounds— A giant-like child. I took the whole Carriage to Trenton,
							and they rode with me— We breakfasted in the first, and dined in the
							second Steam-boat— Here also I met <persRef ref="renshaw-james">Captain
								Renshaw</persRef> of the Navy, now commanding at the Navy-Yard in
							Philadelphia. On landing at the wharf, there was a great crowd of People
							assembled. And among them were <persRef ref="vaughan-john">John
								Vaughan</persRef>, and <persRef ref="degrand-peter">De
								Grand</persRef>— There was also a Coach and four horses at the
							wharf, sent by I know not whom to take me up; but I declined riding, and
							walked to the Mansion House. <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef>, <persRef ref="peters-richard">R. Peters jun<hi

								ref="biddle-clement">C. C. Biddle</persRef> came in immediately
							after my arrival, and a number of other visitors in the course of the
							Evening—among them was <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson</persRef>— There was much
							talk of the result of the recent Elections in New-Jersey and

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> tickets, the former
							of which has been successful beyond their most sangwine expectations;
							having throughout the State a majority of upwards of 4000 votes. The
							majority for the Jackson Electors two years ago having been about 1000.
							This change has been the most consoling and encouraging event that has
							yet occurred— They boasted of a similar change in Pennsylvania, but it
							is not manifested by the issue of the elections here. Sergeant himself
							was a Candidate here; and lost the Election by an equal vote 1597. with
							his principal competitor <persRef ref="horn-henry">Horn</persRef>—A

								ref="binns-john">Binns</persRef> came at 8. Sergeant immediately

							having after long deliberation, and not without much hesitation

							Collector; but complained that all the subordinate appointments in the
							Custom-House were of persons hostile to the Administration, and said he
							had transmitted to the Postmaster General, a formal complaint against

								Bradford</persRef> the Printer: (who named to me <persRef ref="u"

						<p>After a Night of sound repose, I rose this morning entirely refreshed and
							well— Rose to the cares, and Trials, anxieties and dangers which
							surround the Station assigned me, and from which I have been for about
							100 days partially released— As my day shall be so may be my strength,
							for action in the performance of duty, and for submission to the Will of
							Heaven— The visitors of this day came chiefly to welcome my return— The
							Secretaries of State, the Treasury and War spoke of business in general
							terms— <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barbour</persRef> after consultation with <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had written about

									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, enquiring if he would accept an
							appointment as Minister to the Congress of American Nations, transferred
							from Panama, to Mexico— He had received no answer, and now proposed that
							he and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> should go on Sunday to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe’s in Loudon, and converse with him upon the
							proposal—to which I readily agreed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							mentioned also the despatches received from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, shewing a very unpleasant state of our
							Negotiations with Great-Britain, and a Letter from <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> P. B.
								Porter</persRef> at New-York, indicating the prospect of a
							difference, between him, and the British Commissioner, under the seventh
							Article of the Treaty of Ghent, <persRef ref="barclay-thomas"
								>Barclay</persRef>. I had seen Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Porter, and the <persRef ref="delafield-joseph">Agent
								Delafield</persRef> at New-York, and had received from them the same
							information— <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> and
							the other Officers who came with him are assembled as a board of
							Officers, at the invitation of the Secretary of War, to report upon a
							system of Cavalry tactics, and Artillery Instruction— I delivered to
								<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> the Letter from the Executors of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will, informing him that the
							devise to him was deposited in the U-S. Branch Bank at Boston, and that
							by my direction it had been arrested by a trustee process to answer for
							his debts to me, and to others of the family— He said there were
							judgment creditors who would be entitled to a preference. I told him
							that would be a matter to be decided upon by the Courts. He then said he
							had an equitable claim for an offset of his debts to me; which was for
							compensation for acting as my private Secretary at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg; after the Act of Congress
							under which he was acting as Secretary of Legation. This pretension now
							after a lapse of sixteen years, first suggested excited my surprize and
							indignation which I did not suppress. <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi

						<p>Rain almost without intermission the whole day. It confined me to the

							whom forms the occupation of four fifths of my time, and renders long
							continual attention to any subject of business, public or private,
							utterly impracticable— <persRef ref="armistead-f">Armistead</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="branson-joseph">Branson</persRef> came with Letters of

								Clay</persRef> spoke of the Negotiations with Great-Britain, which
							are in ill, and threatening Condition— I had read the recent despatches
							from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> The British Government have assumed the new
							ground, of refusing to negotiate upon the subject of the Colonial Trade—
							They have also made a proposal to compromise the Slave indemnity
							question, by giving £250,000 Sterling, which I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to authorise M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin to accept, after using all reasonable efforts to
							obtain more— I firmly believe we shall in no other way ultimately obtain

								Porter</persRef> should be authorised to consent that the British
							Commissioner <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">Barclay</persRef> should
							refer to his Government, an ultimatum offered by Porter, to fix our

								Southard</persRef> called this morning, the former having received
							an answer from <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, declining the Mission to the Congress
							of American Nations, on two grounds— The State of <persRef
								ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> health; which he thinks will not admit of his
							leaving her—and the necessity of his remaining at home to retrieve if
							possible his private affairs— After some conversation, we concluded that
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Barbour and Southard should
							nevertheless go, and pay their visit to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe at Oakhill— So that my own Letter might be delivered to him—
							Governor Barbour supposed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							upon being informed that no long absence would probably be required of
							him, might with less inconvenience leave his family; and with regard to
							his private affairs, he thought this mission, would be an expedient for
							retrieving them— They accordingly left me to proceed forthwith— I heard
							the Morning Service, by <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>, from Philippians
							4:6. “Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
							supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
							God.”— The first part of this Sermon was a vindication of the character
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul, against charges of extravagance
							and enthusiasm—the last was a commentary, upon the text— In the
							afternoon I heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from Numbers 31.8— “<persRef
								ref="balaam">Balaam</persRef> also the son of <persRef ref="beor"
								>Beor</persRef> they slew with the sword.” A sermon, upon that
							strange, and incomprehensible character of Balaam, the distinguished
							prophet and wicked man. <persRef ref="hagner-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> called between the services— The other names in
							the margin, are of evening visitors. I mentioned to <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>,
							the attachment laid by my direction upon the devise to <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> in the hands of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Executors, and my
							motives for it: my object being to secure the payment of bona fide debts
							due to other members of the family, and to apply the sum payable to me,
							to the support of his family; being determined to receive no part of it
							for myself. I said that Smith’s conduct to me had been so exceptionable,
							that I was not disposed to say any thing further to him about it, but I
							would be glad if he Frye, who holds one of the Notes to be provided for
							would speak to Smith on the whole subject; which he said he would— I
							received this day a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, which relieved me from much concern for his
							health. His Letter is dated the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
							should have arrived here on Friday, or at latest yesterday— He was
							unwell when he parted from me at Newport, but says his health has been
							improved by his excursion— Signed 50 blank, and 9 filled up Patents.</p>

								Adams</persRef> was again taken ill and confined to her bed— I had
							after breakfast a conversation with <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi

							the Treaty of Ghent <persRef ref="porter-peter">P. B. Porter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">Barclay</persRef>— They complain also

							which would now operate in favour of G. Britain, which had been agreed
							upon, and applied in favour of the United States. They propose to
							declare the channel now contested, common to both Nations upon Condition
							that the Channel at Bernhart’s Island, be declared so too. That was
							assigned to the United States upon the Report of the Commissioners under
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay said he should reply to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Vaughan, that the complaint against Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Porter would be communicated to him for his answer, and that the
							proposition for a compromise could scarcely be considered until it shall
							be ascertained that the Commissioners disagree— The Correspondence with
							the Dutch Minister is concerning a discriminating duty, in the form of a
							bounty to their own ships established by the Dutch Government, which
							forfeits the right of Dutch vessels to be admitted into our Ports upon
							the same terms with our own, and would seem to require that the
							Proclamation prescribed by the Act of Congress of 7. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1824. should be issued— But we thought it
							might be more prudent to recommend to Congress some Modification of the
							Act— The Races of this day relieved me from many visitors— The issue of
							the New-Jersey, and Ohio elections to Congress has been gratifying. It
							appears that all the friendly members have been re-elected in Ohio.</p>

							influence of their Offices, against us by the appointment of subordinate
							officers of the same stamp, against us. They alledge therefore that the
							friends of the Administration have to contend not only against their
							enemies but against the administration itself, which leaves its power in
							the hands of its own enemies, to be wielded against its friends— There

							to justify a departure from the principle with which I entered upon the
							Administration, of removing no public Officer, for merely preferring
							another Candidate for the Presidency— I finished this day the reading of

						<p><date>29. V:30.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard this Morning <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Little</persRef>, from Genesis 4:26. “And to <persRef
								ref="seth">Seth</persRef>, to him also there was born a Son; and he
							called his name <persRef ref="enos">Enos</persRef>: then began men to
							call upon the name of the Lord.” The last clause of the verse was that
							upon which the preacher chiefly commented: observing that there was
							little information attainable of the religious observances, or indeed of
							the general condition of the primitive inhabitants of the Earth— That
							there could be little of their history worth knowing as they themselves
							could know very little— That the account of them given by <persRef
								ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, was probably a translation from prior
							hieroglyphics into alphabetical writing: and that it was not pretended
							by Moses to have been delivered to him by inspiration— That the six days
							of creation, were not perhaps natural days of 24 hours, but stages of
							progress in succession— These and other observations somewhat desultory
							led ultimately to the doctrine in which all M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Little’s discourses terminate; the right of private
							judgment, and religious freedom— He noticed the recent decease of the
								<persRef ref="law-frances">widow</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="law-john">John Law</persRef>, at the age of 30, and four years
							after her husband— I called after the service at <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour’s</persRef>, and learnt from a
							Servant that he was much better— In the afternoon I heard a young man at
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef>, from Luke 16.25. “But <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef> said, Son, remember that thou in thy life time,
							receivedst thy good things and likewise <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef> evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou
							art tormented.” There was much ingenuity, and a good portion of
							eloquence in this Sermon, the main argument of which was to shew from
							the emphatic word in the text, “<hi rend="italic">remember</hi>,” that
							the principal if not all the punishment of the reprobate, in the world
							to come, consists in the reproaches of their <hi rend="italic"
								>memory</hi>. The recollection of their own evil deeds— The stings
							of their own consciences. This is no Calvinistic common place of
							atonement and regeneration. The topics were well-managed, and fervently
							urged— A thunder shower came up just at the close of the service, which
							detained me at the Meeting house, half an hour after it was over, and
							through which I finally walked home— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> continues unwell; confined to her chamber— I
							received a Letter from my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> at Boston, who has returned seriously, and I would
							hope successfully to business— I finished writing the draft of a
							decision upon the proceedings of the Court Martial for the Trial of
							Lieutenant <persRef ref="smith-constantine">Constantine Smith</persRef>;
							and I read several despatches from <persRef ref="williams-john">John
								Williams</persRef>, Chargé d’Affaires to the federation of Central
							America, or Guatemala. My time is yet absorbed, leaving much unwritten
							which I ought to write; and much arrear of reading which is
							procrastinated from day to day.</p>

								<l>Day of my fathers birth. I hail thee yet</l>
								<l>What though his body moulders in the grave</l>
								<l>Yet shall not death the immortal soul enslave.</l>
								<l>The Sun is not extinct. His orb has sett</l>
								<l>And where on Earth’s wide ball shall man be met</l>
								<l>While time shall run but from thy spirit brave</l>
								<l>Shall learn to grasp the boon his maker gave</l>
								<l>And spurn the terror of a tyrants threat.</l>
								<l>Who but shall learn that Freedom is the prize</l>
								<l>Man still is bound to rescue or maintain.</l>
								<l>That Natures God commands the Slave to rise</l>
								<l>And on the oppressor’s head to break his chain</l>
								<l>Roll, years of promise, rapidly roll round</l>
								<l>Till not a Slave shall on this earth be found.</l>

						<p><persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> came chiefly to
							recommend <persRef ref="dix-john">J. A. Dix</persRef>, for an
							appointment as Chargé d’Affaires in some part of Europe— Naples, or
							Denmark for example— The General had sent me yesterday a Letter from Dix
							to him indicating his wishes to that effect with Letters of
							recommendation—one particularly from <persRef ref="willett-marinus"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> M. Willett</persRef>— Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Brown had also sent me a Letter from a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns</persRef>,
							soliciting a Consular appointment in the Island of Cuba— And he also
							speculated as usual upon the vagarious politics of New-York— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">D. Brent</persRef> came about the discontinuance
							of a prosecution against an Indian for the murder of another Indian at
							Detroit in the Territory of Michigan. The Secretary of the Territory in
							the absence of the Governor, asks for Instructions and recommends a noli
							prosequi—to which I assented. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> had the proof
							sheets to correct of <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt’s</persRef> obituary Notice, as Wirt himself styles
							it, of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">T. Jefferson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-john">J. Adams</persRef>— I advised the change
							of the Title to that of a Discourse— And I also advised a Note at the
							passage which seems to glance in censure at <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster’s</persRef> conjectural introduction of
							Speeches for and against the Declaration of Independence— I returned to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard the proceedings of the Court
							Martial, upon the trial of <persRef ref="smith-constantine">Lieutenant
								Constantine Smith</persRef>, with my draft of a decision, requesting
							him if he concurred with me in the principle, to mark any passage where
							he should think alterations proper. <persRef ref="brent-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> of Louisiana called
							for a visit— Much gratified at his re-election, and at the issue of the
							Elections in New-Jersey and Ohio. <persRef ref="hamilton-thomas">Major
								Hamilton</persRef> came for an answer upon the papers he had left
							with me. They were claims upon which there had been three years since a
							deci<unclear>sion</unclear> against him, and which I told him I had not I thought the
							power to op<unclear>en</unclear> for revision— A man named <persRef ref="flagg-josiah"
								>Josiah Flagg</persRef> from Martinsburg Virgi<unclear>nia came</unclear> to see and
							talk with me— He said he was born in Massachusetts near <unclear>Boston,</unclear> but
							had lived from the age of two years in Virginia as a farmer. He gave me
							an account of his family, particularly of his three Sons who he said
							would do well, if they did not take to dissipation— He appears an
							honest, and pious man.</p>
