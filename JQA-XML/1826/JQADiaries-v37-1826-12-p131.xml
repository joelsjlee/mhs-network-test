								Thomas</persRef> the naval Architect who resided some time near
							Bladensburg, and now lives at New-York, called to visit me— He had some
							machine to exhibit to-morrow Morning at the office of the Secretary of
							the Navy, where he wished me to attend; which I promised if I should
							have time— <persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colt</persRef>, who told me that
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver</persRef> of
							Baltimore, had certain claims upon the Spanish Government; which he was
							informed might probably be settled to his Satisfaction; if <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">the Minister of the United States</persRef>
							should be instructed to sustain them— The Members of Congress are now
							arriving in considerable numbers for the Session to commence next
							Monday. The nine whose names are in the margin, from <persRef
								ref="gurley-henry">Gurley</persRef> to <persRef ref="barber-noyes"
								>Barber</persRef> were morning visitors recently arrived— <persRef
								ref="silsbee-nathaniel">Silsbee</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> both told me
							they had some English Oak Acorns for me from <persRef ref="colman-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman</persRef> of Salem—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> brought several rectified Statements from the
							Treasury for the Message, and he read to me the draft of his annual
							Report upon the Finances, which he has nearly finished, and intends to
							send in to Congress before the close of the next week. It is a very
							clear exposition of the present State of the Revenue, and proposes the
							loan of sixteen Million of Dollars at five per Cent interest to redeem
							so much of the six per Cents, now or shortly becoming redeemable, which
							I propose to recommend in the Message. <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called to say
							that the number of frigates which we have disposable with a few months
							notice is twenty. He had yesterday supposed it twenty-two; but had
							forgotten one, burnt here on the Stocks, by the British in 1814. and
							another somehow disposed of. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> came with despatches
							from <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef> at Moscow, where he had attended at the
							Coronation of the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor
							Nicholas</persRef>—and had there received his Audience to deliver his
							Letter of Credence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Scott</persRef> the member from Missouri, proposing that the Message
							should recommend a graduation of the price of Public Lands, according to
								<persRef ref="benton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Benton’s</persRef> plan; and also an appropriation <pb type="ms"
								n="132"/>of the proceeds of the lead mines, by a grant to the State
							of Missouri— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that Scott had
							told him that Benton’s propositions had stimulated all the people of the
							Western Country, to madness for the public Lands—but he added that this
							was true only of Missouri— That in Ohio, the sentiments of the people
							were perfectly sound— He said he had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Scott that he could recommend none of his proposals, and that they were
							to be considered only as a revival of <persRef ref="burr-aaron"
								>Burr’s</persRef> enterprize—treasonable in their character—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came;
							anxious for the paragraph of the Message, concerning the Report of the
							Board of Officers, on the re-organization of the Militia— I read to him
							a paragraph which I had prepared, with some remarks pointing out some of
							the most striking defects of the present system. He thought the simple
							paragraph stating the objects for which the board of Officers was
							convened, and referring to their Report was the best— He said he was
							attacked in the Georgia Newspapers; as having assembled this Board of
							Officers without any authority whatever—he supposed it was his friend
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>— This was a harrassing
							day, as well with visitors, as with business— <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Everett</persRef> called and spent part of the Evening with me,
							conversing upon various topics— He spoke of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> to <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Van Buren</persRef>, of several
							sheets which he had seen, explanatory of his Letter to <persRef
								ref="mazzei-phillip">Mazzei</persRef>.— It disclaims many of the
							inferences which were drawn from it at the time, and questions the right
							of the federal party to claim <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef>, as having been of their side— Everett said he
							thought he could obtain this Letter for my perusal.</p>

						<p>I went out to walk this morning, after Sunrise, and having a sprain on
							one foot was an hour and a half walking round the Capitol Square— I met
							and spoke to <persRef ref="hayne-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hayne</persRef> the Senator from South-Carolina— And <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							overtook me near the Capitol— He walked round the Square with me, and
							left me at the central market. <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> called twice; with the
							final Statements from the Treasury of the balances remaining there on
							the first of January last, and to be expected on the first of January
							next—and of the revenue for the present and next succeeding year— He
							brought me also a report, with several Statements from the <persRef
								ref="graham-george">Commissioner of the General
								Land-Office</persRef>, to be communicated with the Message to
							Congress— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush spoke with great surprize
							of the view taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, of the project
							for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canals, which were as surprizing to him as
							they had been to me— <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>
							called to say that he had seen and conversed with <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef>
							the Speaker, and found his dispositions were very good— The General
							seemed anxious to know what would be said in the message of the army;
							and I read to him the paragraph concerning it; with which he was well
							satisfied— Morning visits from 15 members of the house of
							Representatives, among whom J. W. Taylor also 3 members of the Senate—
								<persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lincoln</persRef> came to speak of the Columbian College—and their
							debts— He is of the Baptist denomination, as well as <persRef ref="u"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowles</persRef>, and much
							concerned at the manner in which they have involved themselves in debt—
							He thought they would make provision for it hereafter.— <persRef
								ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major Vandeventer</persRef> brought a
							large budget of papers from the War Department to be transmitted to
							Congress with the Message. <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Roberdeau</persRef> came and set the
							Chronometer, by an observation he had this day taken, with <pb type="ms"
								n="133"/><persRef ref="elliot-william">W. Elliot</persRef>, on
							Capitol Hill— I had by inattention suffered the Chronometer to run down.
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Southard</persRef> came with some information from the Navy
							Department, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to recommend the
							late <persRef ref="kent-james">Chancellor Kent</persRef>, for the
							appointment of judge of the Southern District of that State— J. W.
							Taylor came and dined with me, and I had much conversation with him,
							upon general Politics, upon those of the State of New-York; upon the
							Circumstances of his own re-election, and upon the appointments to be
							made, of District Judge, and of Surveyor for the Port of New-York.
								<persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silas
								Wood</persRef> came in the Evening, with a recommendation,
							numerously signed by respectable merchants of the City recommending M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent for District Judge— But it is four or
							five years, since he was disqualified by the Constitution of that State,
							from holding any judicial Office under it, by his age—and his politics
							have been objectionable to a great majority of the People.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:30.</date> Sunday. Sun rose 7:20.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>, morning and evening from Hebrews 11.24.25.26.
							[“]By faith, <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, when he was come to
							years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;— Choosing
							rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
							pleasures of sin for a season;— Esteeming the reproach of Christ,
							greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he had respect unto the
							recompense of the reward.” This was a discourse upon the character,
							History and Institutions of Moses, and one of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Little’s best Sermons. The explanation of the text was
							somewhat tinctured with the preacher’s sectarian opinions— By faith, he
							understood mere <hi rend="italic">belief</hi>; though I think the
							Apostle in this chapter, and generally where he uses the term, means
							something more— In referring to the principal incidents in the life of
							Moses, he took occasion to remark that his Nurse was his own mother—that
							her name was <persRef ref="jochebed">Jochebed</persRef>, and that she
							must have been a very extraordinary woman, having produced and educated
							three persons of the sublime genius of Moses, the Eloquence of <persRef
								ref="aaron">Aaron</persRef>, and of the poetic rapture of their
							Sister <persRef ref="miriam">Miriam</persRef>— He drew in glowing
							colours the character of the Patriot Moses, who disdained the honours
							and enjoyments of the Court of Egypt, to be the deliverer of his
							oppressed Countrymen. In the Evening he made the application to our own
							times and duties of the principles he had drawn from the biography of
							Moses in the Morning— In the afternoon I heard <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>,
							from John 14.2 “In my father’s House are many Mansions.” The discourse
							was not very impressive— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson
								Hellen</persRef> rode with me to Church in the Evening— Walking
							home, <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef> told us of the accident he had suffered in
							New-York, when on his way to come here— He fell into the dock, as he was
							going to the Steam-boat at 6. in the Morning, and not knowing how to
							swim, narrowly escaped drowning.</p>

							General Smith spoke for the joint Committee, and I answered him, that I
							proposed to make to the two Houses a Communication in writing at 12.
							O’Clock to-morrow— They had adjourned, even before the Committee came—
							But there were not more than half a dozen members called on me in the
							course of the day—probably on account of the weather— Among those who
							did come was <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi><pb type="ms" n="134"/>M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware, for

							after having fully expressed myself with regard to the general

							capitally convicted for the same crime and executed— This man has
							repeatedly petitioned to be released, and now his Sister came with a
							recommendation, signed by many respectable persons recommending that the
							remaining time of his imprisonment might be remitted. It is difficult to
							resist the solicitation of a woman, particularly for mercy to her
							brother— I told her that I would reflect upon the subject, and if I
							could find it consistent with my own sense of duty, would comply with
							the petition— But that the case was of such a nature, that I could not
							give her encouragement to expect this result— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came in soon after,

							punishment of which in this Country ought perhaps never to be remitted;
							and the sentence of ten years imprisonment was in this case itself a
							very mitigated penalty. The annual Message to both houses of Congress
							was this day sent in at twelve O’Clock— They adjourned after reading it,
							and I had visits before dinner from four Senators and twelve members of
							the House of Representatives— I received them in the parlour below, and
							in the intervals between their visits continued the perusal of the
							proceedings of the Court Martial upon the trial of <persRef
								ref="babcock-samuel">Major Babcock</persRef>— <persRef

							He is here again as he was at the last Session of Congress as an Agent
							for the Officers of the Revolutionary War, claiming the Justice or the

							the foundations of their claim, which he requested me to peruse—
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Lear</persRef>, Attorney to <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean"
								>Baron Hyde de Neuville</persRef>, in part payment of Smith’s note
							to him— He asked me when I would see Lear on the subject— I said towards
							the close of the week, as in the mean time I should probably be much
							occupied with visitors— <persRef ref="holcombe-george">D<hi

							will neutralize the hostility of the Chairmen, by the composition of the

						<p>The day was again devoted to the reception of visitors, of whom were the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President Calhoun</persRef>; twelve
							Senators, and 25 members of the House of Representatives— Received them
							in the Parlour; and whenever an interval occurred, I employed it in
							reading the proceedings on <persRef ref="babcock-samuel">Major
								Babcock’s</persRef> Court-Martial— The visitors came one, two or
							three at a time—their names in the margin are ranged, not in the order
							as they came, but the Senators and Representatives, each alphabetically—
								<persRef ref="lawrence-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> is a member from Pennsylvania, and with him came
							eight members of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Convention, which
							assembled this day to the number of near 200. This is an adjourned
							Meeting of the Body which met here in November 1823. but their numbers
							are much enlarged— <persRef ref="barney-john2">Barney</persRef> spoke to
							me of the Petition of <persRef ref="u">Hare</persRef> the Mail-Robber;
							to which he had signed a recommendation for his discharge— But he told
							me that there was a great prejudice against it in Baltimore, and if he
							should be released it was hoped it would be upon condition that he
							should leave the State. <persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forrest</persRef> came with the
							Exequaturs to be signed for <persRef ref="u">Velez</persRef>,
							Consul-General, and also for four Vice-Consuls of the Republic of
							Colombia— <persRef ref="hill-george">George Hill</persRef> wrote me a
							Note, that he had a complaint to make, against an Officer of the
							Government, and being a member of the Φ.B.K. Society, he hoped I would
							hear him— When he came, I found his complaint was against <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Graham</persRef> the Commissioner of the General Land-Office— He has
							been he says these six years one of the Clerks in that Office, and has
							now been compelled to resign in consequence of ill treament from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham— I asked him to specify his
							complaint. He said that some months since he had given an order or two
							in anticipation of his Salary; payable at the close of the last and the
							present Month— That after having given those orders he had found it
							necessary, to take the benefit of the insolvent Act, whereby he had been
							discharged from his debts, and his anticipated Orders, became invalid:
							notwithstanding which, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham insisted
							upon deducting their amount from his Salary— I thought this a weak case
							of complaint upon his own Statement; but he said M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham was very oppressive upon all his Clerks, and was much
							hated by them all; as he had been before, when at the head of the War
							Department. I told him that as to the deduction of his anticipated order
							upon his Salary, it was a matter in which I could not interfere— But if
							he had any specific ground of complaint against M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham, he must reduce it to writing; in which case I would
							have regular enquiry made into it.— <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold</persRef> the Marshal came to
							ask, if I should wish his attendance here at the Drawing Rooms, for the
							preservation of Order, among the Coachmen and Carriages in the yard, as
							has been usual. I desired that he would— He has lately lost <persRef
								ref="ringgold-mary">his wife</persRef>, and said he did not
							generally go into Society— But that he would very readily attend here,
							considering it, in the line of his duty— He did accordingly attend this
							Evening; when <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> held the first
							Drawing-Room for the Season— A week earlier than usual, for the sake of
							the members of the Canal Convention; many of whom were here. The
							attendance was full, but not crowded—</p>

								ref="findlay-william">Governor Findlay</persRef> is a Floor-Cloth

								<persRef ref="jamieson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jamieson</persRef> who had Letters recommendatory of himself for an

								ref="carroll-charles">Charles Carroll</persRef> of Carrollton—
								<persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elgar</persRef> the Commissioner of the Public Buildings brought me
							a copy of a Resolution of the Senate of 29 January 1818. requesting that
							the President would annually cause a Report to be made to Congress, of
							the expenditures upon the Public Buildings and of the progress made
							towards completing them, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar left
							with me two copies of such a Report. In the Evening I had visits
							successively from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pearce</persRef> and <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>— Pearce left home
							only last Saturday and arrived here yesterday— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bailey spoke to me of the claim of <persRef
								ref="hull-william">General Hull’s</persRef> heirs or legal
							Representatives, for his Salary as Governor of the Michigan Territory
							from the time of his arrest, until his Successor was appointed— <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							on the very last day of his Presidential term allowed Hull’s Salary till
							the day of his arrest— I know not on what principle, for he had
							inflexibly refused for years before to make the allowance. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey that I did not think myself
							authorised to extend the allowance any further— He spoke to me also of
							some projects he is revolving in his mind for universal education— He is
							a well meaning man; but one of the most inveterate visionaries, I ever
							knew— I wrote very little this Evening, and my Diary now runs again in
							arrear day after day, till I shall lose irretrievably the Chain of
							Events, and then comes another Chasm in the record of my life— The
							Succession of visitors from my breakfasting to my dining hour, with
							their variety of objects and purposes is inexpressibly distressing— And
							now that members of Congress come and absorb my evening hours, it
							induces a physical impossibility that I should keep up with the stream
							of time in my record— An hours walk before daylight is my only exercise
							for the day— Then to dress and breakfast I have scarce an hour— Then six
							and twenty visitors or more, from ten of the Morning till five in the
							afternoon, leave me not a moment of leisure for reflection, or for
							writing— By the time evening approaches my strength and Spirits are both
							exhausted— Such has been the course of this day. Such will be that of
							how many more?</p>

								Brent</persRef> of Louisiana, yesterday mentioned to me, that
								<persRef ref="skipwith-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulwar

								ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean</persRef>
							the Postmaster General, for the copy of a Letter, written by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> about two years
							since, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean against Skipwith— The
							Post-Office at New-Orleans was vacant. Skipwith was a candidate for the
							appointment, and Jackson, being then a member of the Senate, wrote to
							M’Lean, objecting against him, and charging Skipwith in substance with
							Treachery at the time of the British Attack upon New Orleans. Skipwith
							being then President of the Senate of the State— This Letter prevented
							the appointment of Skipwith as Postmaster then— Last Winter the Office
							was vacant again— Skipwith was again a Candidate, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean who consulted me concerning the
							appointment, sent me this Letter of General Jackson. I told M’Lean that
							with such a Letter on the file, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Skipwith
							must be out of the question, for the appointment— Brent says that
							Skipwith has been informed of the existence of this Letter— That he is
							occupied in writing a Narrative of the Attack of the British upon
							New-Orleans, and of all the Transactions connected with that Event— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent intimated that the Postmaster
							General, thought it a matter of some delicacy to give the copy of such a
							paper, and might perhaps consult me concerning it— I said if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean wished to consult me, I should be
							glad to see him— As to his giving a copy of the Letter, I thought there
							were general Rules at the Department, which would apply to this case as
							well as to others. <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van

							convicted of having with others mutinied on board of a ship; murdered

						<p>Heard at <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little’s</persRef> a young man from Cambridge by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Wells</persRef>— He was a Classmate of my son
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>—but one of those who
							took their degrees. His text was from John 4:23. “But the hour cometh,
							and now is, when the true worshippers, shall worship the Father in
							Spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.” The
							discourse not remarkable, in good or evil— In the afternoon I heard
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Luke 12.16–20. “And he spake a parable unto
							them, saying, the ground of a certain rich man brought forth
							plentifully.—and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
							because I have no room to bestow my fruits?— And he said, This will I
							do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I
							bestow all my fruits and my goods.— And I will say to my soul, Soul,
							thou has much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink,
							and be merry.— But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul
							shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
							hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not
							rich toward God.” The parable itself made up for any deficiency in the
							Commentary— This day was without interruption. I prepared a Message to
							the Senate to be sent to-morrow with three Indian Treaties. and a
							Message to both houses, with additional papers from the War Department
							relating to Indian Affairs.</p>

							Revolutionary Officer, and brought a Letter recommendatory from <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> S.

							bound, from Baltimore to Charleston— This is the same case in which
								<persRef ref="edwards-john">John Edwards</persRef>, applied to me
							for a pardon— The only reason assigned in the Letter for asking the

							testimony of a single witness— I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Verplanck that it was very painful to me to refuse an application for a
							reprieve for a man under sentence of Death. But this was only a mode of
							preparing for a petition to pardon. I had made up my mind in this case;
							not to grant a pardon— It was in all its particulars one of the most
							atrocious murders ever perpetrated— I could grant a pardon upon no other
							principle, than that of formally determining that I would in no case
							whatever permit a capital execution during my Administration. <pb
								type="ms" n="140"/>This I did not feel myself justified in doing—but
							if I should grant a pardon or a reprieve in this case, my imagination
							could not form an idea, of any other in which I could consistently

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Johnson his Colleagues would write me a Letter requesting
							it, I would in deference to them do that, which I could not yield to the

							him— But I added this was all I could say upon the subject— <persRef

							last eighteen Months since— He gave me a narrative of what had passed
							here upon this subject; to which he made various additions in
							consequence of suggestions from me of recollections, from my examination
							of the papers in the Summer of 1825. I reminded him that the materials
							for a decision were so far from being in my mind so clear and

							the decision itself was believed not to be expedient. He said their
							reason for not deciding it was a feeling of delicacy towards <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>— He referred very

							never seen— I told him he would find in it many speeches proper for his
							collection. <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major
								Vandeventer</persRef> brought me back the papers relating to the
							question of rank between Generals <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>Gaines</persRef> and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="newton-thomas">Newton</persRef> called for a morning
							visit; he was detained at home by illness at the commencement of the
							Session, and arrived only two or three days since— <persRef
								ref="little-peter">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Little</persRef> spent an hour of the evening with me, and explained
							to me his motives for wishing the appointment of Marshal for the
							District of Maryland— But he said somewhat doubtingly that he would
							withdraw his pretensions for the present, because he believed if he
							should vacate his Seat in Congress, a person might be chosen in his
							place, unfriendly to the Administration— He intimated a hope that before
							the termination of the next Congress of which he is already elected a
							member some executive appointment might be conferred upon him. His real
							reason is that he does not wish to take the chances of another election
							to Congress— Little is a respectable mechanic of excellent private
							character who has been a member of five or six successive Congresses,
							with an interval during the war, when he commanded a regiment of
							Cavalry. He urged me, if I should not fix upon him, to nominate <persRef
								ref="leakin-sheppard">General Leakin</persRef>, and dwelt much upon
							the unfavourable effect it would have upon the popularity of the
							Administration if a federalist should be appointed. He did not name
								<persRef ref="finlay-thomas">Finley</persRef>, but it was against
							him that his remarks were aimed. This is the only objection that can be
							urged against Finley, and Little intimated that this <hi rend="italic"
								>objection</hi> would be greater in Baltimore, than perhaps many
							other parts of the Union— But it is powerful every where, and will be so
							for many years to come— And it is upon the occasion of appointments to
							Office, that all the wormwood and the gall of the old party hatred ooze
							out— Not a vacancy to any Office occurs, but there is a distinguished
							federalist, started and pushed home as a candidate to fill it— Always
							well qualified, sometimes in an eminent degree, and yet so obnoxious to
							the Republican party, that they cannot be appointed without exciting a
							vehement clamour against him and against the Administration— It becomes
							thus impossible to fill any appointment, without offending one half the
							community—the federalists, if their associate is overlooked— The
							republicans if he is preferred— To this disposition Justice must
							sometimes make resistance, and policy must often yield.</p>

							although that was not his real sentiment. He said he had great

								Findlay</persRef>, the Senator from Pennsylvania, came, this morning
							with Doctor <persRef ref="todson-george">George P. Todson</persRef>, the
							man who was an assistant Surgeon in the army of the United States; was
							tried last Winter by a Court-martial and sentenced to be cashiered—
							Before I acted upon the sentence, powerful interest was exerted in
							behalf of Todson, in whose favour I received Letters from <persRef
								ref="dubourg-louis">Bishop Dubourg</persRef> of Louisiana, and from
								<persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef>— On examining
							however the proceedings of the Court Martial, I found no ground upon
							which I could either reverse the decision or remit the penalty— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> whom I consulted was
							of the same opinion— I approved the sentence of the Court. Todson
							afterwards came, and solicited to be restored to the service; charged
							the members of the Court with gross partiality and determined hostility
							against him, which I told him I could not take for granted upon his
							simple allegation— But I said, if he could bring me proof either of
							partiality or of hostility against him indulged by the Court, I would
							nominate him to the Senate for re-appointment— He then applied to
								<persRef ref="randall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> T.
								Randall</persRef>, as Counsel, who drew up a very ingenious and able
							argument to prove partiality and hostility on the part of the Court,
							from a review of their proceedings, but without adducing a single
							additional fact, or producing a particle of testimony out of the record—
							I read attentively Randall’s Argument; I reviewed again the proceedings
							of the Court—there were some of their decisions which had an aspect of
							harshness— Some part of the charges, which an indulgent disposition,
							might have seen with eyes of mitigation, or of substance atonable by
							punishment milder than dismission from the Service. Still there was
							highly culpable matter proved and unexplained— I could still find no <pb
								type="ms" n="145"/>justifiable cause for reversing the Sentence of
							the Court, or for renominating Todson to the Senate; and I sent to the
							Department of War a written decision to that effect— Shortly afterwards
							I received intimations, first from <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef>, and then from Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Randall, that Todson had come to the most
							cool and inflexible determination to murder me— Randall informed me that
							he had disclosed this purpose to him; had reasoned with him upon it—
							That although Randall had treated the idea with horror and urged the
							atrociousness of it, yet Todson had persisted in the avowal of the
							intention— Had said it would be revenge, and that he would not fly from
							the consequences of the act to himself— Randall was impressed with the
							belief that the danger to me was imminent— That it was no idle threat,
							and that Todson, in a state of utter desperation, was a man who would do
							more than he would say. He advised me to intermit my morning walks—and
							Huntt advised me not to receive Todson if he should come to the house—
							This was the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last month— He now came
							and demanded that I should nominate him for reappointment to the
							Senate—and said there had been several examples of Officers dismissed by
							Sentence of Court Martials from the Service, and afterwards restored to
							their rank and Commission by the President alone— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Findlay said that he had been reading the
							proceedings of the Court Martial, and thought that excepting the charge
							of his having challenged another Officer to fight a duel, there was
							nothing which deserved so severe a punishment as dismission from the
							service— Without answering Findlay, I said D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Todson, whatever you have to say to me, I wish you to say in
							the presence of your Counsel, Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Randall,
							and that you would come here with him. He immediately left the room. I
							then said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Findlay, that I had
							particular reasons for speaking as I had to Todson—reasons which he
							himself would understand, but which I could not with propriety disclose
							to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. He then withdrew, and in the course of
							less than an hour, Todson came back with Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Randall. He then renewed his demand that I would nominate
							him to the Senate for re-appointment, or for an appointment to some
							other Office— I said that if I could think it consistent with my duty to
							nominate him to any Office, it would be to that from which he had been
							removed, because that was an Office in the line of his profession—but I
							had answered him on that subject more than once. There was no more
							painful duty within the compass of my service, than that of confirming a
							sentence of dismission; and it had been peculiarly painful to me in his
							case— But after the maturest consideration I had deemed it to be my
							duty, and I had seen no ground upon which I could retract that decision—
							I had given it formally in writing to the Department of War— But I added
							Captain Randall knew there were other reasons now which rendered it
							utterly impossible that I should contribute to restore D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson to the public Service, and I had
							desired that he should be present, at my answer to any such claim by the
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> because he knew those reasons. They
							did not in any manner change my determination. I should not renominate
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson, even if they did not exist,
							but had my disposition been otherwise before they would now foreclose
							all possibility of my ever doing any thing for him— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Randall said he should deeply regret the
							effect, if the notice he had thought it his duty to give me, should
							deprive D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson of the benefit of any
							thing I might otherwise do for him— I said it had deprived him of
							nothing— I could have done nothing for him, had this incident never
							occurred. Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Randall said that he had
							most earnestly expostulated with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson,
							against the execution of his design; and that on a conversation with
							him, after the notice that he Randall had given me, he had understood
							from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson that he had abandoned the
							intention, of which Randall had desired a common friend of ours to give
							me notice— He had therefore considered the previous intimations of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson, as the effects of an extraordinary
							momentary excitement, and that I might consider them as entirely given
							up by him; and might favour him accordingly— I said I was perfectly
							willing to consider the threats of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Todson, as the effect of a momentary alienation of mind, for <pb
								type="ms" n="146"/>which he should not be held responsible— That I
							had said nothing of it to any person, and it was my reason, for deducing
							to converse with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Findlay upon the subject
							when he had called with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todson— I had
							said nothing of it even to him; but I was not the less under a threat of
							assassination, and what must be the universal opinion of the world, if
							under such a threat, and when he who made it knew I was informed of it,
							I should at his demand nominate him to a public office— He might take
							the answer now once for all— I never would nominate him to any office
							whatever— Todson himself neither denied nor disavowed threat, but
							somewhat faintly said he had given up the idea, upon being informed that
							I had expressed sentiments of compassion upon his case— I said there
							could be no more painful duty to me to perform, than that of dismissing
							an officer from the service— I had felt his case as a hard one and had
							expressed myself accordingly, but I had no doubt of my duty and had
							performed it— He then asked me for assistance to pay his debt contracted
							here for board, and to enable him to return to New-Orleans— And his
							manner and deportment concerning his threat of assassination was
							evidently intended to make the impression upon me, that he would still
							execute the purpose if I did not either nominate him to office, or
							furnish him with money— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Randall at
							length told him that it was useless to press me further, and they
							withdrew together— Randall had reminded me of the murder of <persRef
								ref="perceval-spencer">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Percival</persRef> by <persRef ref="bellingham-john"
								>Bellingham</persRef>— And those of <persRef ref="harley-robert"
								>Harley</persRef> (attempted by <persRef ref="guiscard-antoine"
								>Guiscard</persRef>[)], and of <persRef ref="villiers-george"
								>Villiers</persRef> by <persRef ref="felton-john">Felton</persRef>
							occurred to my own Reflections— <persRef ref="angus-samuel">Captain
								Angus</persRef> the Summer before last, upon the failure of a
							similar application to be restored to the service after dismission by
							sentence of a Court martial had in like manner threatened the life of
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>— Desperate men, are prepared for desperate Deeds.
							My life is in the hands of a higher power than the will of man— While
							this incident forcibly brings to my consciousness the frail tenure upon
							which human life is held, may the Spirit of God sustain and preserve me
							from any weakness resulting from it, unworthy of my station— There was a
							succession of other visitors through the day— <persRef ref="cook-daniel"
								>D. P. Cook</persRef> introduced a <persRef ref="enos-pascal">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Enos</persRef>, who is Receiver of
							Public Moneys at Springfield in the State of Illinois. <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> came with a <persRef

								Silsbee</persRef> called to have some conversation with me,
							respecting the measures to be taken, by Congress at their present
							Session, relative to the trade with the British Colonies in America— It
							is from the first of the present Month, interdicted in our vessels by
							the British Government— Some countervailing measure is to be taken on
							our part; and there is an opinion prevailing among the members of
							Congress friendly to the Administration that this will be the subject
							upon which the opposition party will make their principal attack at this
							Session— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee had not read the
							documents communicated to Congress with the Message but wished to know
							what my views were of the measures to be taken— I told him my own
							opinion was that there should be an Act of Congress totally interdicting
							the trade, with all the Colonies both in the West Indies and in North
							America— But that the same Act should provide for the reopening of the
							trade, upon terms of reciprocity whenever the British Government shall
							be disposed to assent to them; and if Congress think proper to accept
							the participation of the trade even without entire reciprocity, I wished
							them only to consider and determine how far they would be willing to
							concede advantages to British shipping to the detriment of our own— I
							would myself advise no concessions, but I would acquiesce in any that
							Congress would sanction— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Boston warmly recommending him— They both of them spoke of the bitter
							and almost universal prejudice against Degrand, in Boston; with which I
							have been long acquainted, and which I have regretted— They both thought
							the prejudice unfounded, but not the less inveterate— There is in
							Degrand an obtrusiveness of manners to which few can accommodate
							themselves at all, and none without sacrifice of feeling— Crowninshield
							expressed a doubt whether Degrand was a Stockholder in the Bank U.S. and
							Silsbee said that among the strong objections to his appointment, would
							be that of his being a Broker— I told them that he was a Stockholder in
							the Bank— That he was very desirous of being appointed a Director, and
							had obtained several very respectable recommendations— That I had myself
							so good an opinion both of his integrity and of his intelligence, that I
							should if I consulted my own feelings only, take pleasure in nominating
							him— But I was aware of the strong prejudice against him to which they
							had alluded, and should duly consider their advice before making the

								>John</persRef> to him and invited them all into the House, where
							they were all individually introduced to me, and shook hands with me.

								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="force-peter">Force</persRef>, the Editors of the

							quackery to drum up recruits for his School—which is already quite as
							successful as it deserves— He has now nearly three hundred Scholars at
							Middletown, many of whom are withdrawn from Colleges and Universities to
							be drilled into Soldiers, marched about the Country laying the people
							under contributions of hospitality, and getting puffed by newspapers
							into fashion and popularity— It is well that the modes of education
							should be varied— That a competent number of Surveyors, Engineers, and
							military Officers should be formed among the youth of the Country: but I
							felt no inclination to extol the system of military education; nor to
							discountenance it by remarking how much more suited to usefulness and
							respectability in after life is a College Education, than that of a
							Military Academy can possibly be— I therefore barely thanked them for
							their visit, as they were going away: told them I should be glad to see
							them again occasionally while they should remain here, and that I wished
							them all prosperity and success in their studies and pursuits— Their
							visit was of about half an hour and at their departure they were again
							up and gave me a marching Salute— They are very well drilled to the
							manual exercise, and marching to time— The Secretary of War came with
							recommendations for the appointment of an Indian Agent in the place of a
								<persRef ref="ofallon-benjamin">Major O’Fallon</persRef> who has

							obtain it from others— I told him once for all, I would do nothing for

							again for <persRef ref="dubourg-louis">Bishop Dubourg’s</persRef> Letter

								>John</persRef> then made another search for it, but could not find

							to him—but that he had no right to it, inasmuch as it was addressed not
							to him but to me, and that he could not want it, as he had himself among
							the papers relating to the Court-Martial, another letter from the same
							Bishop Dubourg, of the same import which he admitted— He said that the
							Circumstance to which I had alluded (his threat to assassinate me) was
							absurd; and besides, that he had harboured no such idea since he was

							influence upon the issue of the Election of President— That for himself
							he had no wish either to be a Candidate for the Vice-Presidency, or to
							withhold himself from it, if it should be thought useful to the cause
							that he should be run for that Office— I told him that I had hitherto
							heard very little said upon the subject— That if the failure of his
							health should render the duties of the Department of State too
							oppressive for his continuance in it, I should be satisfied, if he
							should be transferred to the Vice-Presidency; but otherwise, I should
							think it more advantageous both for the public and personally for him
							that he should continue in the far more arduous and important office of

							find it extremely difficult to fill— I said it was not my intention to
							compliment him, but I must say it would be no easy matter to supply his

							That without complimenting me, he would say that he had found every
							facility in transacting business under me; and he should be equally well
							pleased to continue in the Department of State, or to pass to the

						<p>The <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Secretary of the Senate</persRef> came,
							with a Confirmation of several appointments, and a Resolution calling
							for information, respecting the removal of obstructions from the Rivers
							Mississippi and Ohio. <persRef ref="lee-henry">Henry Lee</persRef> came
							to ask again for the papers which he had lent me some months since,
							consisting of Letters from <persRef ref="washington-george">General
								Washington</persRef> to his <persRef ref="lee-henry2"
								>father</persRef>— I told him I had yet read only a small part of
							them, and wished much to read the rest— He said he was now going to
							Alexandria, and if I would send them to him there as early as next
							Tuesday, I might keep them till then— He wished me to return them with a
							note and my signature in my own hand writing—and he renewed a request he
							had made that I would furnish him with an autographic signature of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef>— I told him I was not
							sure I could readily find one, my father having scarcely written at all,
							during the last years of his life; owing to the dimness of his sight—
							Lee spoke of the new Slave-indemnity Convention, and said he had himself
							lost several Slaves during the late War, taken by the British— He could
							not prove they were carried away after the peace; but he thought he
							ought to be indemnified for the loss of them— <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ford</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ironside</persRef> came with copies of Papers called for by a
							Resolution of the House of Representatives, relating to the Treaties
							concluded between the Southern American Republics at Panama. <persRef
								ref="king-john">J. A. King</persRef> came to take leave, intending
							to leave the City on his return to New-York— He spoke in terms of warm
							acknowledgement of the kindness I had shewn him in his late
							appointments, and declared his disposition to serve me, if at any time
							it might be in his power— <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford</persRef>, a Senator, from
							New-York came and had a long conversation with me respecting the
							appointment of a Surveyor at that Port. He spoke of the original
							appointment of <persRef ref="swift-joseph">General Swift</persRef> to
							that office, as having given great dissatisfaction; he not having been
							at the time even a Resident in the State— He had also given occasion to
							complaints of inattention to the duties of the Office, had resided
							always at Brookline, and had engaged in numerous private pecuniary
							speculations which had absorbed his time, and turned out not very
							creditably to his character— His reappointment would not be generally
							satisfactory; but there would be much competition for the place, which
							would probably resolve itself into a question between three or four
							persons— He thought it might be expedient to postpone the appointment
							for some weeks, as among the candidates was a person named <persRef
								ref="robinson-jonathan2">Robinson</persRef>; now a member of the
							New-York Legislature at Albany, and the appointment now might affect the
							movements there— He said that the People of the State of New-York
							generally were satisfied with the administration of the general
							Government, but that there was a mass of deep disaffection in the city—
								<persRef ref="furst-moritz">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fürst</persRef> came at last with his bill for the ten silver
							medals, which I bespoke of him— They are intrinsically worth about one
							dollar each, but he charged me, and I paid him without asking any
							questions ten— That is one hundred dollars for the ten medals. <persRef
								ref="wallack-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Richard

								<persRef ref="stone-asaph">Asaph Stone</persRef> against <persRef

								ref="forrest-richard">R. Forrest</persRef>; for which Smith had

							which I found deeply interesting— Lee was one of the most distinguished
							partizan Officers of our Revolutionary War: though he rose in it no
							higher than to the rank of a Colonel— But he was in great favour with
							Washington— From 1791 to 1793—he was Governor of Virginia, and commanded
							in chief the troops (militia) sent against the Pennsylvania insurgents
							in 1794. Afterwards Lee was a member of the U.S. House of
							Representatives, and in that character delivered by appointment of the
							House the funeral Eulogy upon Washington— His subsequent life was
							neither fortunate nor very creditable. He died obscurely within the last
							ten years.</p>

								Southard</persRef> spoke of the nominations which I sent a few days
							since to the Senate of a <persRef ref="betts-samuel">District
								Judge</persRef>, for the Southern District of New-York, and a
								<persRef ref="finlay-thomas">Marshal for the District of
								Maryland</persRef>; both which were preceded by great excitement,
							and have occasioned numerous disappointments— The <persRef
								ref="rossell-william">District Judge in New-Jersey</persRef> has
							done the same; and there is now great difficulty with regard to the
							appointment of a Collector for the Port of Philadelphia— Southard told
							me he had been informed that <persRef ref="houston-samuel">General
								Houston</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							Tennessee had in his possession a Letter from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to Southard, abusive
							upon him in Jackson’s highest style of scurrility—but Houston had been
							advised by some of Jackson’s friends here not to deliver it— So he
							retains it for the present to consult his principal— The cause of this
							billet-deux, was some observations made by Southard last Summer at a
							dinner at Fredericksburg, criticising Jackson’s Military movements at
							New-Orleans, and commending <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef> exertions in
							preparing and providing supplies for the defence of that place. These
							remarks made in the social confidence of a convivial party, have been
							tale-borne to the Hero, and have produced upon him the effect of a
							scarlet Blanket upon a Tyger— He has written this Letter in furore:—and
							entrusted it open to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Houston, to
							deliver here— But upon consultation of the privy Council it has been
							thought best to withhold the Letter at present, for further advisement—
								<persRef ref="gayler-c">Gayler</persRef> is an Englishman, Son in
							Law to <persRef ref="burt-peter">Peter Burt</persRef>, who has
							recommended him earnestly to me for a place which I have not, to bestow
							upon him— <persRef ref="burleigh-william">Burleigh</persRef> called for
							a morning visit— He has been suffering with the rhumatism, but is
							convalescent— <persRef ref="king-william2">W. R. King</persRef>, Senator
							from Alabama, came and introduced his colleague <persRef
								ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef>, elected in the place of
								<persRef ref="pickens-israel">Israel Pickens</persRef> who has
							resigned— <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie</persRef> brought a confirmation by the Senate of several
							nominations among which are the District Judge at New-York Betts, and
							the Marshal of Maryland T. Finley; and also a Resolution Call— <persRef
								ref="sloane-john">Sloane</persRef> came to speak of that in
							exhaustible controversy the removal of the Land Office from Sandusky to
							Tiffin— <persRef ref="carter-john">Carter</persRef> from South-Carolina,
							is another convalescent visitor. <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee"
								>Satterlee Clark</persRef> came to appeal from the decisions of the
							Accounting Officers of the Treasury upon <pb type="ms" n="153"/>his
							accounts— He insists that he has had three judgments in his favour, and
							denies the right of the Government to an appeal for the decision of the
							Supreme Court of the United States— He left with me copies of the
							verdict of the Jury, and Judgment of the Court in his favour— <persRef
								ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ironside</persRef> brought me the papers prepared, to answer a Call
							from the House of Representatives relating to the Panama mission— I gave
							to <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> my decision
							upon the proceedings of the Court-Martial, upon the trial of <persRef
								ref="babcock-samuel">Major Babcock</persRef>— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							mentioned to me the Conversations he had had with <persRef
								ref="king-john">J. A. King</persRef>, with regard to the settlement
							of his Accounts, which I had authorised to be made according to the
							established Precedents— He also made some remarks upon the expediency
							which some of the friends of the Administration—Eastern, Northern and
							Western thought there would be in agreeing upon a Candidate, to be
							supported at the next election for the Vice-Presidency— He intimated
							that some of his friends were inclined to his being selected as the
							person— Said he himself had no preference for, or against it— His only
							wish was that the selection should be so made as to promote the cause of
							the principal election— He said however that in the course of the last
							Summer, he had observed to Governor Barbour, that he thought it might be
							desirable that he Barbour should be supported for the Vice-Presidency— I
							said it would be on personal considerations altogether agreeable to me
							that either of them should be voted for by my friends, as
							Vice-President— That in regard to him, I should wish him to possess the
							Office of the two, the Vice-Presidency or the Department of State, which
							would be most agreeable to himself— But that so long as his health would
							sustain the labours of his present Office, I believed it would be much
							preferable both for his own and for the public interest, that he should
							remain in the Department— For his own because the manner in which he was
							discharging the duties of the Office, was highly creditable to himself;
							and at the same time satisfactory to the Nation—for that of the public,
							because, without intending to compliment him, I could not hesitate to
							say that if he should vacate the Department, I should find it extremely
							difficult to supply his place to my own satisfaction or to that of the
							Country— He said that without intending a compliment on his part, he
							assured me that he was entirely satisfied with the situation that he
							held, and with my treatment of him in it, and that he had never
							transacted public business with any person, more invariably yielding
							every facility that he could desire, than he had found in me— I finally
							said that with regard to the Vice-Presidency I had no preference of my
							own and should be satisfied with any choice upon which the friends of
							the Administration could unite.</p>
