						<p>This succession of visitors absorbed the whole day and Evening; and left

								<persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan Roberts</persRef>— Watkins

								>Mercer</persRef> and <persRef ref="bassett-burwell"
								>Bassett</persRef> against <persRef ref="webster-daniel"

							reached the Capitol, on account of the death of <persRef

								ref="thayer-sylvanus">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							Resignation of <persRef ref="richards-g">Captain Richards</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="mills-elijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Mission was again postponed in Senate, on account of the ill health of
								<persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tazewell</persRef>, and some other Senators— The Resolution in the

								Thornton</persRef> observed that I had some months since asked him
							for a view of the Patent-Office System; and of any improvements of which
							it might be susceptible. He had accordingly sent me a paper on the
							subject, and now came to enquire if I wished any thing further
							concerning it. I told him it was under the Consideration of a Committee
							of the House of Representatives— If they should propose any new
							Legislation concerning Patents, they would require information, which he
							could give them— But I thought it not probable they would revise the
							Patent Laws, at least during the present Session of Congress. <persRef

							brought me a copy of the proceedings of the Senate upon the nomination

							is a Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> and Brevet Brigadier General in

							had doubts whether this territorial Law was conformable to the acts of

							the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of the election and under that word
							manner, directed that it should be by Districts— And now if the
							selection is made from those having the greatest number of all the
							votes, all the members will be from two or three of the districts, and
							the others will be quite unrepresented— This and some other
							Considerations induced me to acquiesce in the Act of the Legislature of

						<p><date>5. V:45.</date> To the Central Market— Cloudy.</p>
						<p>Heard this Morning <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Little</persRef> from Acts 28.30.31. [“]Paul dwelt two

							the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him.” And in
							the afternoon <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Solomon’s Song 5.16. “This is my friend”— The
							text is only a small part of the verse, and thus extracted from the
							context presents a different meaning from that which it bears in the
							whole verse— The friend, in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s
							exposition is Christ, and that opens at once upon the beaten path—
							Between the Services, <persRef ref="cutting-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. B. Cutting</persRef> called and
							mentioned to my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> that one
							of the New-York Newspapers spoke of an arrival from Havre announcing the
							Death of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> at
							Taganrok on the Sea of Azoff. He died it is said of his old lame leg,
							the Erisypelis striking to it; about the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>
							of December. The account of this event travelled first to Warsaw—thence
							to Berlin, whence it was sent by a Telegraphic despatch, from the
								<persRef ref="ferron-pierre">French Minister</persRef> to his
							Government; and reached Paris the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
								Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> The Emperor Alexander, was perhaps
							of all living men the man whose life was most important to the rest of
							mankind— To what changes his death may lead conjecture is at fault. From
							personal motives, I ought to cherish his memory, for through my Agency,
							he rendered essential good Offices to my Country. His influence upon the
							history of my life has been great and auspicious— <persRef

							of the State of Kentucky on the side of the judge-breaking party— I said
							I had entertained a friendly disposition towards Gen<hi

							were here in Cabinet Meeting upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							absent, confined to his house by a relapse of the Influenza— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour’s plan is differently modified,
							from that which he had at first prepared— He has given up the idea of
							incorporating the Indians into the Several States where they reside— He
							has now substituted that of forming them all into a great territorial
							Government West of the Mississippi— There are many very excellent
							observations in the paper; which is full of benevolence and humanity— I
							fear there is no practicable plan by which they can be organized into
							one civilised or half-civilised Government— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, all expressed their doubts of the
							practicability of Governor Barbour’s plan; but they had nothing more

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said he was told this by persons

							that it might be well to send a Message to the House, to appease this

								>Calhoun</persRef> there manifested his purpose of draining the

							that was partly true, but that Smith had silenced him as a lawyer in his

							the charges had been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in the
							House of Representatives; who were of opinion that they were sustained,
							but declined reporting an impeachment, because Smith was a Territorial

							It is in truth an enticement of Officers from our Service; and the

							Acts 26:26. “for this thing was not done in a corner”—an argumentative
							discourse in favour of Christianity, from the generality of its
							application to all mankind. In the afternoon he preached from Psalm
							137.1. “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when
							we remembered Zion.” His exposition of this text was somewhat
							mystical—considering Babylon as emblematical of the world, and Zion, of
							the Christian Church. But from this view of the Subject there was, it
							seemed to me, not so much material for the pathetic, as there would have
							been in a discourse drawn from the plain and direct meaning of the
							words, with historical reference to the time when the Psalm was written—
							There was a woman baptized after the reading of the Morning Prayer, and
							the Communion Service was read—of which I heard only the first part, on

						<p><persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie</persRef> brought me this morning the two Resolutions of the
							Senate adopted in Executive Session— The first declares that the
							question of the expediency of the Panama Mission, ought to be debated in
							Senate with open doors, unless the publication of the documents to which
							it would be necessary to refer in debate would prejudice existing
							Negotiations— The Second is a respectful request to the President of the
							United States, to inform the <unclear>President</unclear> whether such
							objection exists to the publication of all or of any part of those
							documents, and if so to specify to what part it applies?— These
							Resolutions are the fruit of the ingenuity of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren</persRef>, and bear the
							impress of his character— The Resolution to debate an Executive <pb
								type="ms" n="95"/>nomination with open doors is without example; and
							the 36<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Rule of the Senate is explicit and
							unqualified, that all documents communicated in confidence by the
							President to the Senate shall be kept secret by the members— The request
							to me to specify the particular documents the publication of which would
							affect existing negotiations was delicate and ensnaring. The limitation
							was not of papers the publication of which might be injurious; but
							merely of such as would affect existing negotiations; and this being
							necessarily a matter of opinion if I should specify passages in the
							documents as of such a character, any Senator might make it a question
							for discussion in the Senate, and they might finally publish the whole
							under the colour of entertaining an opinion different from mine upon the
							probable effect of the publication— Besides, should the precedent once
							be established of opening the doors of the Senate, in the midst of a
							debate upon Executive business, there could be no prospect of ever
							keeping them shut again. I answered the Resolutions of the Senate, by a
							Message stating that all the communications I had made to the Senate on
							this Subject had been confidential, and that believing it important for
							the Public Interest that the Confidence between the Executive and the
							Senate should continue unimpaired, I should leave to themselves the
							determination of a question, upon the motives for which, not being
							informed of them, I was not competent to decide. <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">W. H. Harrison</persRef> called to speak
							about the case of <persRef ref="bissell-daniel">Bissell</persRef>, and
							is extremely anxious that he should be restored to the army with the
							rank that he had— This was an old controversy between <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							and the Senate, in consequence of which the Office of Colonel of the
							second Regiment of Artillery has remained four years vacant— The Office
							of Adjutant General had remained in the same condition— At the extra
							Session of the Senate last March I nominated <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef> to be the Adjutant General, and the Senate advised
							and consented to the Appointment— On the nomination of Bissell now, they
							have taken a different course, by passing a Resolution, that in the
							opinion of the Senate Bissell is entitled to rank as Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> in the army from 1812. and as Brigadier
							General by Brevet from 1814 and that the President may arrange him
							accordingly— Which Resolution assumes that the President is to act
							according to the Senate’s opinion of the Law, and that the Senate are to
							inform him how he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> perform his duty— Harrison
							spoke also of their Resolutions of yesterday and apologized for having
							voted for them— <persRef ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Seymour</persRef> came to speak of the appointment of a
							Collector in Vermont— The Delegation have not yet determined whether to
							recommend the reappointment of <persRef ref="fisk-james">Fisk</persRef>
							or not— He spoke also of the Resolutions adopted yesterday by the
							Senate, which he disapproves.</p>
