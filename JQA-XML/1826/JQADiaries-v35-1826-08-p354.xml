						<p><date>Tuesday 1. August 1826.</date> I had engaged to meet <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							between nine and ten this morning at Dedham; but while at breakfast I
							received a budget of despatches and Letters which occupied necessarily
							more than an hour, and <persRef ref="sprague-joseph2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph M. Sprague</persRef> of Salem
							came to visit me, by which I was so detained that it was past ten before
							I arrived. My Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went with
							me—I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef> there— We attended at the Probate Court, before
								<persRef ref="robbins-edward">judge Robbins</persRef> who read the
							Will in open Court, and administered to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greenleaf the Oath, as a witness to its execution— The Probate Bond was
							then sealed and signed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, my Son
							George and me; but by an accidental mistake, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy’s eldest Son <persRef ref="quincy-josiah"
								>Josiah</persRef>, not being present, the final execution of the
							Bond, and that of the other Bond, as Trustees of the bequests to my
							brother and his family, were postponed until the Court to be held next
							Tuesday at Quincy— There was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> <unclear>Bugbee</unclear></persRef> present in Court, who signed the Bond
							as a Witness, and there were three women there upon business of their
							own. I then came with George into Boston, and found my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother’s</persRef> Son <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas
								B.</persRef> at <persRef ref="hamilton-james2">Hamilton’s</persRef>
							Exchange Hotel, where we dined— At 2. we proceeded to Charlestown, and
							were met at the Bridge by one of the Marshals of the day, who conducted
							us to the House of <persRef ref="thompson-abraham">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomson</persRef>, the Chairman of the
							Committee of Arrangements— Here a small number of the Citizens were
							introduced to me among whom several had been at the Bunker-Hill Battle,
							and sufferers by the conflagration of Charlestown— <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson’s father</persRef> was one.
							After a handsome collation we walked to the Town Hall, where a great
							crowd of Citizens had assembled. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomson
							announced me to them, and said he should proceed to introduce each of
							them individually to me. The Hall was however so full that this was
							impracticable. A few near me were introduced, and then the Doctor
							observed that he should dispense with any further personal
							introductions— We proceeded then through a heavy-shower of rain to the
							meeting house, where an opening prayer was made by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fay</persRef>; an Eulogy upon <persRef
								ref="adams-john">John Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef>, was delivered by
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Everett</persRef>, and a concluding prayer by <persRef
								ref="walker-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Walker</persRef>—with occasional anthems and dirges— We returned to D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomson’s to Coffee, where <persRef
								ref="u">his Lady</persRef> and about forty others were introduced to
							me— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> was present
							at these Solemnities— I returned to Boston, and after an hour at
								<persRef ref="otis-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> S. A.
								Otis’s</persRef>, came to lodge at the Exchange— Found <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef>
							here. The Sheriff <persRef ref="sumner-charles">C. P. Sumner</persRef>
							came to say the Governor would receive me tomorrow at the Council
							Chamber.</p>

							Committee of Arrangements of the young Men, came to the Hotel, and I
							went with them to the State-House where I was received by <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> at the Council

								>John Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas

								<persRef ref="greenwood-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							company of City Guards in which my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> is a Lieutenant— He was however not with them on
							this occasion but with us— The services were completed about ten

								rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef ref="loring-john"
								>Loring</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Sampson</persRef>, two of the
							members of the Committee of Arrangements— At 11. I went again to the

							Governor <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Thomas L. Winthrop</persRef>,
							were with the <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Mayor</persRef>, and
							authorities of the City were assembled, and when we went in procession
							to Faneuil Hall, and heard an Eulogy upon John Adams and Thomas
							Jefferson by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daniel Webster</persRef>— The prayers were performed
								by    <persRef ref="lowell-charles">Charles Lowell</persRef>— There
							was a funeral symphony Anthem and Dirge— The Streets from the State
							House to the Hall were thronged with a greater concourse of People than
							I ever witnessed in Boston— The Hall itself was crowded to the utmost of
							its capacity. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster was about two hours
							and a half in delivering his discourse, during which attention held the
							whole Assembly mute. He returned with us to the Hotel, and thence to his
							own home. The Governor also paid me a visit accompanied by his
							Aids—Lieutenant Colonels <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Josiah Quincy
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and <persRef
								ref="davis-john3">John B. Davis</persRef>. He was to return this

							his <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">son T. B.</persRef> and my Sons George
							and <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, at Lieutenant Governor

						<p>A person, who said his name was <persRef ref="u">Dunbar</persRef>, and

									>r.</hi> Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf with my Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"

								>William</persRef> called, and he brought me a large bundle of

							with all the family, to <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Minot Thayer’s</persRef> at
							Braintree— There, after, about two hundred citizens of the neighbouring

								ref="perkins-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Perkins’s</persRef> Meeting House, where an Eulogy was to be

								Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi><persRef ref="storrs-richard">M<hi

							of Randolph. There was the Anthem “Child of Mortality,” and a Dirge,
							written by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Fyfield</persRef> a Lady of Weymouth, once Miss Bond— The Eulogy of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs, was professionally made a

							Gods:— But ye shall die like Men”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs
							disclaimed Eulogy or panegyric, but bore a warm and affectionate

							returned for a few minutes to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

						<p><persRef ref="adams-charles4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles

								Milton</persRef>, also called from Braintree; a revolutionary
							Soldier— A Pensioner under the Act of 1818 but struck from the List in
							consequence of the Act of 1820. He brought with him a piece of a Ramrod
							which he says was accidentally shot through his body, thirty-six years
							ago, by a Militia Soldier at a parade. It confined him for three years
							and has much disabled him ever since— He is anxious to obtain a
							restoration of his pension, and proposes to petition Congress, which I
							encouraged him to do— I bathed at the wharf with <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-george" type="multi">my Sons</persRef> at
							Noon; but remained not more than ten minutes in the water— As we were
							about rising from dinner there came four Penobscot Indians, named

								ref="clew-john">John Clew</persRef>, <persRef ref="dana-swassen"
								>Swassen Dana</persRef>—and <persRef ref="souzo-saul">Saul
								Souzo</persRef>— The first, a man as he said 67 years of age; the
							last a boy of about 14. The pretence of their visit was to see their
							father the President of the United States— Their real object to beg,
							which they did with great assiduity, and address— They live, the old man
							told me, about twelve miles from Bangor, on Penobscot River, and are
							wandering about the Country; collecting what they can obtain— They
							brought me a Letter of recommendation from <persRef
								ref="fenwick-benedict">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Chests, with good locks for the preservation of Papers— George is making
							a copy of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will, in a
							book, wherein I propose that a Record of the proceedings of the
							Executors under it shall be kept— Some questions with respect to the
							operation upon my father’s Will of the subsequent disposal by him of a
							part of the Estate bequeathed by him in it, make it necessary to proceed
							with the utmost caution, and full deliberation— I received this
							afternoon Letters, from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, written the first inst<hi rend="superscript"

							influence with the Collector of the Customs at Boston, to obtain some
							office in that Department for him— The young Lady urged his suit with
							much eloquence, and not without tears. I promised to speak of her father
							to <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">the Collector</persRef>— My Son John
							went into Boston this afternoon with T. B. Adams j<hi rend="superscript"

							successive appearances of the Stars of the first and second magnitude,
							as the darkness of Night came on— But at the close of the day I am not
							satisfied with the manner in which it has been employed— I have signed
							450 Land-grants, at Crawfordsville, Indiana, sent me by <persRef

								Whitney</persRef> this morning from John 4:34. “Jesus saith unto
							them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his

							having reached my sixtieth year, I am yet not a member of any Christian
							Church— As this is the Church to which my fathers have belonged, from
							its foundation; little less than two hundred years, I have perhaps too
							long neglected to join it— After dinner, I attended with <persRef

							heard <persRef ref="cutler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutler</persRef> from Exodus 20.13. “Thou shalt not kill.” It was
							one of a Series of discourses which he is preaching from the ten
							Commandments— This Society is small, but they make up in zeal, what they
							lack in numbers— The house was well filled.— Returning home, we stopped
							at the grave-yard, and found the Tomb where my Parents repose duly
							repaired— We found the Tombstones of <persRef ref="thompson-william2"

							from <persRef ref="coddington-william">William Coddington</persRef> by
								<persRef ref="tyng-william">William Tynge</persRef>, a Merchant of
							Boston— From him it descended to his daughter <persRef

								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went into Boston this

							with the Mount Wollaston Estate, and which I had never before had time

							paying the whole sum required by it although a very valuable portion of

							assured him, upon which he should have the house would be as easy to

						<p>I attended with my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, the

							this morning— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="bass-josiah">Josiah Bass</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">Josiah Adams</persRef>, as Appraisers, and to

								rend="superscript">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy came
							home with me, and we had some conversation, concerning the bequest to me

							is entirely revoked, by the subsequent alienation of a part of the
							Estate, or whether I can still take the remnant of the farm, by paying
							the sum annexed as the condition to my taking the whole— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy had no doubt that I may; but
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> has doubts, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy thought it might be proper to
							take an opinion of a Lawyer, upon the Question— He mentioned <persRef
								ref="jackson-charles">Judge Jackson</persRef>. I said I should wish
							first to take the opinion of the judge, and if he should have no doubt,
							I would act upon his opinion— If he doubted, we might take the opinion
							of Judge Jackson— I wrote a circular, to be sent with copies of the
							Will, to <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, <persRef

							wrote four questions upon the Will, signed by myself, and after dinner
							took them up to the judge, requesting his decision upon them— He said he
							would call on his way home in the Evening, and answer them— I walked
							round by <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller’s</persRef>. The
							judge called late in the Evening, and repeated the opinion, that the
							devise to me was so far valid that I might take the Estate as now
							remaining, on the condition of paying the sum at which my father had
							estimated it with the 103 acres— But as I told him that I had read some
							authorities in the Law-Books, which left it doubtful, he said he would
							take further time for advisement and consult <persRef
								ref="swinburne-henry">Swinburn</persRef>, the best authority in such
							cases— I mentioned to him the grounds of my difficulties, and said I was
							prepared to take the place, as reduced by the last conveyances and pay
							for it the whole sum of ten thousand dollars required by the Will— But
							to proceed with safety I wished to have a decree to sanction the
							proceeding— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf called this

						<p>As has repeatedly happened during my present absence from the seat of

							left in a closet at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster’s— At the

								<persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N.

							persons from the adjoining towns of Danvers, Beverley, Gloucester and
							Marblehead were introduced to me, and a procession was formed on the

							return to the practice of the Law— I replied that if that was his
							intention, a Seat in the Senate would be an easy and honourable descent
							from the Chair to the Bar—which hitherto no Governor of Massachusetts
							had made. That in my wish to see him in the Senate, I looked to a period
							beyond that of my own continuance in the public service—to a field more
							extensive for the exercise of his Talents, than any one State could
							afford; to the future character and influence of New-England in the

								Bowes Whitney</persRef> of Hingham, this morning from Proverbs 15.3.
							“The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the
							good” and in the afternoon from Proverbs 30.8.9. “Remove far from me
							vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food
							convenient for me:— Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the
							Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
							vain.” It rained almost without interruption the whole day. There were
							at Meeting less than forty persons in the morning, without a female or a
							singer— In the afternoon about fifty—one woman, and singers enough to
							make discord. I invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney home to
							dine with us, and took him to <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Whitney’s</persRef> when the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s</persRef>, and obtained his
							signature to several papers relating to the Execution of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bowes Whitney, is an intelligent man and a sensible preacher
							but has not much conversation. He told me however some anecdotes, and
							among the rest one—of my father’s Cousin <persRef ref="adams-zabdiel"
								>Zabdiel Adams</persRef>, Minister of Lunenburg, who at the time
							when my father was President, complained to <persRef
								ref="whitney-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s
								Father</persRef>; that he himself, had not made the Law his
							profession instead of preaching— For, said he, why should not I have
							been President of the United States as well as my Cousin John?— The Law
							might have carried M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zabdiel Adams to
							Congress—perhaps to the Senate of the United States; for he was a man of
							good Talents; and in this Country the Law is the natural profession of
							men, aspiring to political distinction. But in the notices which I have
							collected, from the Town records, from the few papers the preceding ages
							which have come to my hands, from <persRef ref="mather-cotton"
								>Mather’s</persRef> Magnalia, and <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
								>Hutchinson’s</persRef> History, and lastly from the Catalogue of
							Harvard College, I cannot overlook the difference of Fortune in Life,
							between those of my kindred, who were educated at Cambridge, and those
							deprived of that advantage— My father’s <persRef ref="adams-joseph5"
								>uncle Joseph</persRef> was graduated at Harvard, and became an
							eminent Minister, at Newington, New Hampshire. If my <persRef
								ref="adams-john4">Grandfather</persRef> himself had received the
							same education, he would have been distinguished, either as a Clergyman
							or as a Lawyer.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>But knowledge to his eyes, her ample page</l>
						<l>Rich with the spoils of Time, did ne’er enroll.</l>

						<p>The Governor of the State of Maine, <persRef ref="parris-albion">Albion
								K. Parris</persRef> called upon me this morning to make enquiries,
							respecting the present state of the negotiation with Great-Britain,
							concerning the boundary between that State, and the British Province of
							New-Brunswick— I told him that owing to the continued illness of
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
								King</persRef>, since his arrival in England, and his resignation
							which has been accepted, no progress had been made in the negotiation,
							since it was left unfinished by <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>— But that <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> had received particular Instructions on the
							subject, and had made him-self fully master of it, before he left this
							Country— That I was expecting daily to hear of his arrival in England,
							where he would immediately apply to the British Government to resume the
							Negotiation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris spoke of the deep
							interest which his State had in the controversy; and although he
							expressed full confidence that the Government of the United States would
							consent to no stipulation injurious to the rights of the State, yet he
							said they were not without apprehensions that New-York might be willing
							to purchase Rouse’s point, at the expence of Maine— He manifested a wish
							to be furnished with copies of the arguments of the Agents and Reports
							of the Commissioners under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article
							of the Treaty of Ghent, which we declined giving heretofore from an
							apprehension that a premature disclosure of them might operate
							unfavourably upon the Negotiation— I told him that their great bulk, was
							an obstacle to the furnishing of copies, but that they had been and
							would still be open to the inspection, and perusal of the
							Representatives and Senators from Maine in Congress, and would be
							equally so to the Governor of the State if present. He said he should
							retire from the Government of the State at the close of the present
							year, and gave me a cordial invitation to attend the Commencement at
							Bowdoin College, the first Wednesday in September—he also promised that
							if I would come, the visit should be as private and unceremonious as I
							could wish— <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas B. Adams jun<hi

						<p>A day without interruption, which I employed in signing

								ref="tyng-william">William Ting</persRef>, of Boston—Merchant, made
							on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1661 after his

								ref="shepherd-anna">Anna</persRef> his wife, <persRef
								ref="tyng-bethiah">Bethiah</persRef> and <persRef ref="tyng-mercy"
								>Mercy Ting</persRef>, dividing in equal parts the property between

								>Anna</persRef>, the daughter of this Thomas and Anna Shepard, who
							married first my Ancestor <persRef ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel
								Quinsey</persRef>, and afterwards the <persRef ref="fiske-moses"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Moses Fiske</persRef>— And it
							was the Anna Shepard, whose name is subscribed to this Deed, who in
							1709. bequeathed the Estate at Mount Wollaston, the portion assigned to
							her in the deed, to her grandson, <persRef ref="quincy-john">John
								Quincy</persRef>, my great Grandfather— The Deed is acknowledged on
							the day of its date before <persRef ref="atherton-humphrey">Humphrey
								Atherton</persRef>; but does not appear to have been recorded— It is
							so defaced, that I have been obliged to leave several blanks in the
							copy; but the blanks could contain nothing material to the character of
							the contract— The portions of Bethiah and Mercy Ting, are also located
							at Braintree, and that of Elizabeth Brattle at Boston. William Ting
							appears never to have resided at Braintree, but on the town Records his
							brother <persRef ref="tyng-edward">Edward</persRef> is named as a
							Magistrate who solemnized many marriages. William Ting’s name appears as
							a Captain of a Military company here; and <persRef ref="quincy-edmund2"
								>Edmund Quincy</persRef> the second, as successively a Lieutenant,
							Captain, Major, and Lieutenant Colonel. He was also a Justice of the
							Peace, and according to <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
								>Hutchinson’s</persRef> History, one of the members of the Council
							of Safety, in April 1689. chosen to administer the Government which had
							been taken by a popular Insurrection, from the hands of <persRef

							were soon obliged to return. </p>

							from a large wild Cherry tree which formerly stood on the upland just
							without the fence bounding my Salt-marsh— The fence however does not
							surround the lot; one side of it being across the Marsh where no fence
							could stand— And here the line is in dispute with <persRef

							line upon which we were carrying the chain, as that which belonged to my
							lot— But Glover said Captain Bracket had lately been there; had
							forbidden any person from cutting the hay beyond the line claimed by
							him, and threatened to prosecute any one who should— The third lot
							surveyed was one called the eight Acre lot; approaching the beach upon
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s Salt-works are erected,

							Shower of Rain, which drove us home and suspended our field labours for
							the day— In the afternoon, I received a heavy Mail of Letters from

							engaged in the examination of the boys in Geography, which was followed

							in prose and verse, from a compilation recently made and published— Then
							two or three Specimens of good Declamation— An exhibition of the writing
							Books, and of several Samples of writing— All good none very superior—
							The mayor then distributed the medals awarded to the most deserving of
							the boys, but observed that the Committee had at that School had some
							difficulty in assigning the Prizes, from the great equality of the
							performances— He observed also that there was some deficiency found in
							the examinations of Geography and the Rules of Arithmetic at this
							School, which was attributed to the absence of the Master for several
							weeks by indisposition— We thence went to the High School, a recent
							institution, where the higher mathematics are taught without the
							languages— The examination here was in Geometry, in the Roots and
							Powers; in the simple equations of Algebra, and in what they call mental
							Arithmetic, the immediate performance of compound multiplication and
							division without pen or pencil—paper or slate— There was one declamation
							here, but the Mayor was obliged by the pressure of Time, without waiting
							for the distribution of the prizes there to hurry to the Latin
							School—where there was construed by the boys part of the third Satire of
								<persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef>, and the Ode to Mercury of
								<persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef>. Then various Declamations in
							English, Latin, Greek Verse and Prose, and the distribution of the

								Gould</persRef> the Master. We then walked in procession, after the

								<persRef ref="withington-mather">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="hall-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

							acquainted with the local sites went with us as a guide— He shewed the
							boundaries, the bearings and courses of which were taken by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington— We were upwards of five hours,
							traversing the woods; climbing rocks, wading through Swamps, and
							breaking through the brakes— It was literally a tangled forest, and
							before we got through discouraged my brother and my Son John, so that
							they strongly intimated they should go no more upon such Service— On the
							ledge, close by that where the Rail-way corporation are at work, Farrar
							discovered three Snakes, two of which he killed, and <hi
								rend="strikethrough">George</hi> John brought them home as Trophies—
							They were what our Men called bastard Rattlesnakes; half-breeds between
							that Reptile, and the Water Snake; but they had no rattles; nor a tail
							formed ever to have any— They were about three feet long, and four
							inches in circumference— We were told that yesterday the workmen at the
							Railway had killed a Rattlesnake with ten Rattles, which came within a
							few feet of where they were working. It began to rain soon after we got
							into the woods, and continued until we came home, though moderately—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington went home directly from
							the ground promising to come again on Saturday—if the day should be
							fair; but inclining rather to wait till Monday, for the next day’s
							labour. It was past three O’Clock before we got home, and the Ladies of
							the family had dined. My brother, my Son John and I dined together— In
							the afternoon and Evening, I wrote to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> of the Department of
							State, and in this Journal. It rained almost the whole of the afternoon
							and Evening; so that we were confined to the House— There were
							invitations came by a special messenger, from <persRef
								ref="kirkland-john">President Kirkland</persRef>; to attend the
							Commencement next Wednesday; and the Boylston Prize-speaking the next
							day; and then to dine with him— He wrote me also that unless prevented
							he should to visit me to-morrow— The large Potatoe-worm found on the
							step of the door on the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> this morning,
							after three days of a nearly torpid state, cast his skin, just as the
							other Sphinx had done, and became a green nymph or pupa; which was
							gradually blackening the whole day. We have now several, which in
							various ways have gone into the Chrysalis condition.</p>

							in the air, which was itself damp &amp; dense, almost to the consistency
							of Rain— I passed the day and Evening writing—without Tediousness, but
							without clearing off my budget of unanswered Letters— It is the Stone of
							Sisyphus— The more heavily I roll it uphill, the more precipitately it
							sweeps down again— I answered two Letters from the <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Secretary of War</persRef>—wrote one to <persRef
								ref="colman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman</persRef>
							of Salem, to whom I send a copy of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my

								ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thomson’s</persRef> Teas. But this I did

							the Surveys of all the Lands belonging to <persRef ref="adams-john">my

							twentieth day since the Sun rose clear Two thirds of that time has been
							drenched with incessant rains— The chain men yesterday waded over their
							knees through a swamp, which in ordinary times at this Season would have
							been dry; and this is the period of the year when the Rattlesnakes and
							other venomous Serpents are most dreaded and dangerous— My motives in
							having the Surveys made were to ascertain the boundaries, which have
							long been uncertain of much of my father’s Lands, and in attending
							myself to have a knowledge of them which I never possessed— Had the
							weather been as it almost always is at this time of the year, dry, there
							would have been little difficulty; but the proper times for surveying
							these Lands would be in April or May with the first drought, before the
							heat of Summer, or in September and October, in the clear cool drought
							of Autumn; or in the Winter, with the ground and swamps hard frozen, and
							covered with a thin Coat of Snow. If I am obliged to leave the Surveys
							incomplete, the Sales cannot be made before my return to Washington, and
							all the arrangements for the Execution of the Will must remain

							decline, I thought a public reception at Cambridge now, might be
							considered as a mark of partiality to my own Alma Mater, which even if
							justifiable might give some offence— Next year, or at some other Time, I
							hoped it would be more in my power to accept the proffered kindness of
							the Corporation— In this he acquiesced— <persRef ref="willard-emma">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Willard</persRef> my next visitant is
							the keeper of a female Seminary of Education at Troy in New-York— About
							a week since I received a Letter from her, urging the expediency that
							Congress should patronize an institution for female education, with a
							small pamphlet published by her, recommending the same subject to the
							Legislature of New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Willard is a
							sensible and spirited woman, and I told her that her purpose of
							improving female education, had my approbation and hearty good wishes;
							and with regard to any assistance from Congress I was sorry she must
							expect nothing more— Congress I was convinced would now do nothing— They
							will do nothing for the education of boys, excepting to make Soldiers;
							they will not endow an University— I hoped this disposition would
							change; but while it continues, any application to Congress for female
							education must be fruitless— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Willard
							thanked me for the frankness with which I had spoken, which she said she
							preferred to the delusive flattery with which her sex were usually
							treated, and after some intelligent discourse on female education, took
							leave. <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Walker</persRef> of Charlestown, in the morning from Romans 2.15
							“Which shew the work of the law, written in their hearts, their
							Conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while
							accusing or else excusing one another”— In the afternoon from Psalm 34:8
							“O taste and see that the Lord is good.”— Both these Discourses were
							argumentative, and that appears to be M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Walker’s turn of mind. The drift of the Morning Sermon was to shew, that
							Conscience is not sufficient to restrain men from crimes, unless aided
							with the belief and fear of retribution hereafter— In that of the
							afternoon was a warm exhortation to deserve the divine favour, and share
							in its blessed fruits— There were passages of Eloquence in both, and a
							picture of the death bed of a sinner tortured by remorse of Conscience
							drawn with vigour and coloured with Address— But there is a stiffness of
							manner in the delivery which marks the whole School of Unitarian
							Clergymen in this neighbourhood, and of which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Walker has too much— He came home and dined with us— I asked
							him some questions concerning the <persRef
								ref="shepherd-thomas2;shepherd-thomas4" type="multi">two Thomas
								Shephards</persRef> who were successively Ministers at Charlestown,
							and <persRef ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy</persRef>. He had already

								father’s</persRef> request without success— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fay</persRef> is the Minister of the
							first Congregational Society at Charlestown, and has the old Records—
							Towards Evening I called at <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>— He
							shewed me in his orchard near the house a humming bird’s nest, with two
							young ones in it just fledged. They filled the nest which had scarcely
							room for them— On my lifting my finger over them at two or three inches
							distance, they took flight, and one of them alighted on a neighbouring
							tree— The other fell into the grass and was taken up and restored to the
							nest by <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price Greenleaf</persRef>. They
							were full grown, and about the size of an English walnut— <persRef

							compiler of the family genealogy— He was here some weeks since, and I
							made some enquiries of him concerning the second <persRef
								ref="adams-henry2">Henry Adams</persRef>, which he was not able to
							answer— He now brought me an Extract from the Town Records of Medfield
							from which it appears that at the first Settlement of that Town, about
							1650. he removed to it from Braintree, and was there as he had been at
							Braintree the first Town-Clerk— The names and dates of birth of <persRef

								>r</hi> C. J. Adams’s objects in calling upon me this morning, was
							also to say that he was desirous of obtaining some place in the
							Custom-house at Boston— I told him I would mention his name to the

								Boylston’s</persRef> at Princetown. She proceeded nevertheless

							with him; but sent the Carriage and Horses back to Washington, where our
							Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> also went— She came
							in the Steam-Boat from New-York to Providence, and arrived last Evening

							anxious to have the other Surveys of the Woodlands postponed till late
							in the Autumn; but in that case there could be no settlement of the
							Estate, before my return to Washington. I desired him to come the first
							settled fair day, and said we would proceed and Survey as far as we
							could— Stopping wherever we may find it impracticable to go on— This day
							like twenty which have preceded it was Sultry, with fog, mist and
							frequent showers of Rain— I walked round by the Canal brook, before
							breakfast, hunted by Moschito’s, and was confined to the house the
							remainder of the day. Wrote two or three short Letters, and signed 75
							Land-grants.</p>

							to reside for some time as a graduate; to pursue his theological studies
							there. The weather has this day been fair, and the sky clear; but warm,

							has multiplied the insects, particularly moschitos to a degree, beyond
							any thing that I ever knew any where. It has driven me back many times,
							from Evening and Morning walks and even from short visits to the garden—
							I find indeed no difficulty in occupying all my time within doors— The

								Withington</persRef> the Surveyor came about eight this morning and
							we resumed the Survey of the Wood-lots, belonging to <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate— Our party this day,
							besides the Surveyor were, <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother</persRef>— <persRef ref="porter-david">David
								Porter</persRef>    <persRef ref="u">Harmon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Ordway</persRef>, <persRef ref="farrar-isaac"
								>Farrar</persRef>, and my man Servant <persRef ref="pote-william"
								>William Po<unclear>te</unclear></persRef>. Porter and Harmon are woodsmen,
							heretofore employed by my father to cut wood upon his lots for the
							consumption of his family— Porter is an old man 74 years of age, having
							lost an eye, and infirm in health— Harmon a man of about 45. in full
							vigour and perfectly acquainted with these woods— Two lots were
							surveyed—one called the Quincy, Beale &amp; Savil lot, and the other the
							Adams lot, being one given by <persRef ref="adams-john4">my
								Grandfather</persRef> in his Will, to my father and my <persRef
								ref="adams-peter">Uncle Peter Boylston</persRef> in common and
							subsequently divided between them— We entered the woods about 9 O’Clock
							in the morning, and came out of them between five and six in the
							afternoon. We traversed a continual thicket of Woods, four fifths at
							least of which consisted of Oaks—White, Black, Gray, Chesnut, and Scrub—
							With these were intermingled, White, and Pitch Pine, red Cedar, Hemlock,
							Chesnut, Black Beach, Bass Wood, (American Lime of Michaux) Shellbark
							and pignut hickory, Black Birch, yellow Ash, Sassafras, Witch-Hazel, and
							several others, which neither I nor any of the company knew— With these
							were brambles and briars, barberry bushes, blackberry vines, many
							creeping vines, plants and mosses, of which we were all ignorant— Of the
							animal creation, I took no account. We started several pheasants and a
							covey of quails— Saw an hawk hovering over a precipitous ledge of rocks
							at least 200 feet high which we ascended—heard occasionally the croak of
							the crow, and the scream of the blue Jay— We descended into deep vallies
							and crossed running brooks about half-leg deep, and ascended upon ledges
							of rocks whence the town and the harbour of Boston, alive with all its
							navigation, and the spines of all the neighbouring villages were in
							prospect around us. About 2 O’Clock we took a delicious repast of slices
							of corned beef, bread and cheese, apples and pears with Rum, wine, Cider
							and water— My dress was light and succinct, and better prepared, for the
							tangles of the forest, and against both moschitos and the possible
							chances of Snakes than last week— I was however in a continual stream of
							perspiration, nearly the whole day, and constantly annoyed by the
							insects— We stop’d sometime on our return at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Porter’s— This was Commencement day— <persRef

						<p>We continued the Survey of the Woodlots— <persRef ref="withington-mather"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Withington</persRef> came, and
							we started about 9. A.M. turned up at the lane opposite to <persRef
								ref="u">Arnold’s</persRef>, just beyond the old ninth Mile Stone,
							and entered the fields a few rods beyond <persRef ref="porter-david"
								>David Porter’s</persRef> House— We were engaged part of the morning
							in correcting an error made yesterday—our company now being, with the
							Surveyor, <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Harmon</persRef>, <persRef ref="spear-elijah">Elijah
								Spear</persRef>, <persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Farrar</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">Ordway</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pote-william"
								>William P<unclear>ot</unclear>e</persRef>, my servant man— Spear left us after the
							survey was completed of the lot with the bounds of which he was
							acquainted. That is about noon— The Survey of the last Lots called
							Borlands being 25 acres we could not complete, the line running through
							a Swamp so deepened by the late rains that although William and Farrar
							waded nearly half their depth into it, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Withington could not get all the lines for it— The day was passed much
							the same as yesterday; but this day we returned and took our dinner,
							which was precisely similar to that of yesterday, at the place where we
							had left our horses and carriages— We went forth again however after
							dinner, and completed all that can be done by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Withington— The only bounds which mark the lines between the
							lots of different individuals are small heaps of Stones placed in
							certain directions by the Compass— We returned home about six in the
							Evening, and in coming from the fields turned to the right and came
							round by the old mill-pond, and the Meeting House— I pursued this day as
							far as I was able, the enquiry concerning trees and plants, but with
							little more than the conviction, that weeks, months and years would be
							necessary to obtain an accurate knowledge of even the plants which cover
							the surface of the grounds we have traversed I confined my attention to
							the trees and shrubs principally— To the Oaks mentioned yesterday are to
							be added, the Red-Oak, the Sycamore or Button wood, the American Poplar,
							and White Birch— The Poke-Berry, Brake, and Fern, with the poisonous
							Ivy, and yet more poisonous dogwood— And there were yet many herbs,
							plants and vegetations from the earth of which no one could tell the
							names. When I returned home I found, <persRef ref="u">M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Homer</persRef> from
