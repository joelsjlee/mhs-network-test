							immediately upon the receipt of it to Gothenburg, there to enter upon a

							Beasley, and Packets of Newspapers and Public Documents, all of which he
							left on Board the English Packet in which he came to Holland— He was

						<p><date>2. VI:15. </date>I sent this morning to the British Minister,
								<persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef>, requesting to
							see him, and to know the time when I should find him at home. He
							appointed One O’Clock this afternoon— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Norman</persRef> called upon me and I
							had some conversation with him, concerning the most advisable manner of
							proceeding to Gothenburg; which at this Season of the year is not
							without difficulty— The Gulph of Bothnia, being just at this Season
							passable neither upon the ice, nor in Boats. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Norman has travelled between this place and Gothenburg
							several times, and now intends to go there as soon as the Mails expected
							from England shall have arrived— He thinks the shortest and safest way
							of going at this Season, will be by the way of Memel, and there
							embarking to proceed by water. He intends going thus himself, and if I
							should finally conclude to go, leaving my family here, I agreed with him
							that we should go together— He told me that he believed <persRef ref="u"
								>Schmidt</persRef>, who was <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s</persRef> Clerk would be glad
							to go with me, as my private Secretary— He writes a fine hand, and
							Harris considered him as so confidential that he employed him to copy
							all the Papers under the former Mission Extraordinary— I shall want some
							such assistance, but this Young Man is not to me quite so confidential
							as he might be to Harris— Norman told me also that he dined yesterday at
								<persRef ref="lewis-john">Lewis’s</persRef> in company with this
								<persRef ref="strong-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Strong</persRef>, who said that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was
							desirous also of being private Secretary to either of the American
							Ministers— I called upon Lord Walpole at one O’Clock—the hour he had
							appointed— Told him the order I had received to go to Gothenburg, and
							asked him if he could inform me whether Commissioners on the part of
							Great-Britain had been appointed— He said he could not; that he had
							received no dispatches from his Government of later date than 24.
							December. There are now 22 Mails from England due.— But he said by his
							last accounts from Stockholm of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							March he learnt that some of the Mails were landed—they might be
							expected every day— He had heard from private letters that <persRef
								ref="hammond-george">George Hammond</persRef> had been appointed;
							but there must be others— He did not know who— Perhaps <persRef ref="u">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster</persRef> might be one— But he could hardly
							conjecture who it would be— George Hammond was getting to be an old Man;
							he must be near sixty, and he was very fat— I told him I had known M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hammond from the year 1783 when he was
							Secretary to <persRef ref="hartley-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hartley</persRef> the British Commissioner at the definitive Treaty
							of Peace— That he was then a Student at Oxford, where I afterwards saw
							him. That he must be now about 51 years old.— I mentioned the Letter
							from <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> proposing the direct Negotiation, and told him I
							was surprized to find in it stated, that <persRef ref="cathcart-william"
								>Lord Catchcart’s</persRef> Note to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Count Nesselrode</persRef> had been made known to the American
							Plenipotentiaries, and they had answered that overture contained in it.—
							That in fact no Communication of it ever had been made to us— That
							excepting what he, Lord Walpole had told me of it I never knew any thing
							of this Note, untill I found it Yesterday in the printed Documents I had
							received.— He said he had no doubt that the knowledge of it had been
							purposely withheld from us, because if it had been communicated, Russia
							would have had nothing further to do with the matter, but <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Romanzoff</persRef> had got into his head
							some wild and absurd project of a Congress and a Maritime Law; and he,
							Walpole, was as sure as he was of his own existence, and he believed he
							could prove it that Romanzoff had <hi rend="italic">been cheating us
								all</hi>.— In the first place the Mediation had never been proposed
							to Great Britain untill they were informed of the Appointment of the
							American Ministers— When they received this information Lord Cathcart
							was ordered verbally to decline the acceptance of it; which he did at
							Bautzen in June— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> said
							in answer to this, that he could have nothing further to do in the
							business—that he had written so to Romanzoff, and had ordered him to
							make the Communication to the American Ministers— His answer to Lord
							Cathcart had been; well, I can do no more in the business—“Je m’en lave
							les Mains.”— That Romanzoff on receiving this order, instead of obeying
							it, had sent it back to the Emperor, with a project of his own, to renew
							the offer of the Mediation, which the Emperor did afterwards approve,
							and the Instruction to renew the offer of Mediation was sent to Count
							Lieven, <hi rend="italic">which he did</hi>.— That Romanzoff knew
							perfectly well the <pb n="84" type="ms"/>answer of the British
							Government, and he, Walpole believed that he could produce proof of it,
							which would be receivable in a Court of Justice; though he would not say
							so positively— That Romanzoff had told him so himself; that he knew it
							unofficially; and not otherwise— He pretended that the only knowledge he
							had if it was by a letter which <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General
								Moreau</persRef> had written to Monsieur Gallatin, and which
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Monsieur Gallatin</persRef> had shewn
							to him, stating that Lord Cathcart had told Moreau the English
							Government had rejected the Mediation. But Romanzoff must forsooth cling
							to his project of a Maritime law— It was the folly of all the Russians—
							Ever since the year 1780 he did not believe there was a Russian
							breathing, but was infected with this absurdity of Maritime Law— A
							Maritime Law by compact between one power and another was a very proper
							thing, and assuredly if there was a liberal maritime Law in the world it
							was that of the Treaty between England, and Russia, and what could they
							want more? Yet even such men as <persRef ref="czartoryski-adam">Prince
								Czartorinski</persRef> and <persRef ref="novolitserv-nikolai"
								>Novosiltzoff</persRef>, (Czartorinski was undoubtedly a very
							superior Man— Novoziltzoff was not— He was a very fair, honourable man,
							but he meant superior, in intellect) even they some years ago, after a
							dispatch which had no concern or relation with the subject—“à propos de
							botte”—had added a Postscript, saying that they hoped England would
							hereafter relax in her Principles of Maritime Law— Maritime Law!—
							Russia! said Mylord, and reddened as he spoke; why Russia may fight us
							till she sinks, and she will get no Maritime Law from us— That is, no
							change in the Maritime Law— Maritime Law submitted to a Congress! what
							can there be upon Earth, more absurd?— I said that whatever Count
							Romanzoff’s projects about maritime Law might have been, he had never
							manifested to me the most distant idea of connecting them with this
							Mediation— That the offer of Mediation came form the Emperor himself—
							That Count Romanzoff told me it was made to England at the same time as
							to the United States— That it was merely as a common friend anxious for
							the restoration of Peace between the two parties, that the Emperor had
							made the offer— Not a syllable upon the subject of maritime Law had ever
							been said to me by the Count throughout the whole transaction— However,
							I added, that much as I regretted the failure of this attempt to
							accomplish a Peace, I hoped the issue of the new effort, by direct
							Negotiation, would be more propitious— Lord Walpole said he understood
							the expectations from it were very sangwine, both in England and in
							America; I said I had heard they were in America; and it was natural
							they should be for an object that was so much desired— He said that
							wherever the Misunderstanding in the former case originated it was to be
							regretted, for he was perswaded that had it not happened, the Peace
							might have been made eight months ago.— He said he heard <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> was in the New Commission; and he looked sour in
							pronouncing his name—and <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>—whom he did not know.—
							I told him that I had no official information of the names— <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							and my self were ordered to Gothenburg, with intimations that other
							Commissioners would be joined with us, and meet us there.— I had heard
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell was appointed Minister to
							Sweden, and he might be joined in the Commission on that account.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, at the time of his appointment was
							Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States. I
							concluded by asking him if he should receive any account of the
							appointment of British Commissioners, to have the goodness to inform me
							of it, as it would hasten my departure if I saw a probability that they
							might soon be there— I should be sorry to make any person wait there an
							hour for me— He said if he heard of an appointment he would give me
							immediate notice— That he expected some of the Mails every hour, and
							they could not be much longer delayed. He had told me that he himself
							had written Lord Cathcart’s note to Nesselrode of 1. September— That he
							thinks it was written at Prague, the 23<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> or
								24<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August, but not presented
							untill they came to Töplitz— Our Conversation was of about half an hour—
								<persRef ref="strong-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Strong</persRef>, <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="slade-j">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef> dined with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— I had asked <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Montreal</persRef>,
							who called on me this morning, but he was unwell, and asked me to excuse
							him. <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> had also paid me
							a visit while I was abroad this Morning.</p>

							was customary— I told him that would be then what I should wish, and as
							I presumed there would be as usual a Court on Easter-Monday, which is
							next week, I had supposed it might suit the Empress’s convenience that I
							should take leave of her on that day, and had therefore sent him my
							Note, in Season to obtain Her Majesty’s orders before that time. He
							promised to take care of it, and to give me seasonable notice of the
							time she should appoint— I mentioned to him that <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							was to be left here as Chargé d’Affaires. That I had written to him to
							give him notice of this arrangement; and <pb n="86" type="ms"/>that his
							return might be expected very shortly. I referred him also to the part
							of my Note, disavowing the answer stated by <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to have been
							given by the American Envoys, to the proposition of a Negotiation at
							London or Gothenburg made in <persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord
								Cathcart’s</persRef> Note to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode</persRef>, dated 1. September 1813 at Töplitz.— He said
							he would not fail to make the Emperor acquainted with it.— From M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Weydemeyer’s I went to <persRef
								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome’s</persRef>, and found him at home.
							I had not seen him since last October, when he was recalled, but
							concluded not to leave this Country. He said he had been sick almost the
							whole winter; and always confined to the house— The Peace between
							Denmark and Russia was made, and <persRef ref="lizakevich-vasily">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lizakewitz</persRef> had returned to
							Copenhagen— But he, Blome, had nothing yet from his Government— We had a
							conversation of an hour and a half upon the whole range of political
							subjects;—Norway, France, Sweden, the American and English War, the news
							from the Armies, and <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>— Blome’s opinions with regard to <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon’s</persRef> condition are nearly
							the same as my own. He considers him at the lowest extreme of
							desperation, and holds it impossible for him to save Paris from the
							allies. He is as might be expected very inveterate against <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Bernadotte</persRef>, but represents his
							character and motives in his own peculiar point of view. Says he has
							done nothing for the allies— That his Swedes have scarcely burnt an
							ounce of gunpowder, that he hung back at Leipzig; that he ought to have
							been at Brienne; in which case the whole affair would have been finished
							then— That his real hatred and that of all the Swedes was against
							Russia, as I should see if I went into that Country. That it was
							astonishing how the allies were besotted in their admiration of
							Bernadotte, and the like— As to Norway, he said the Swedes would find it
							harder to take, and to keep that Country than they were aware— The
							people there would be, and must be, starved into submission; but Sweden
							would be forced to keep there a considerable number of troops, and to
							feed them too, which she could not easily do— The Norwegians had
							declared themselves independent; at peace with all the world, and
							determined only to defend themselves against any power that should
							attack them— They had sent deputies to England, but the English pleading
							their engagements with Sweden had refused to receive them— Bernadotte
							had made very light of the whole affair, but it would yet give him
							trouble. The Baron told me he had seen Count Romanzoff yesterday, and
							found him in very good Spirits— He mentioned to me the Counts present
							political situation, which I well knew before— He also told me that when
							he had intended to go away last Autumn he intended to have deposited
							with me the archives of his Legation, and had obtained the approbation
							of his Government for it— But they were now all sent away— I called on
								<persRef ref="strong-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Strong</persRef> at the Hotel de l’Europe; and looked over his
							travelling Books and maps.— I went to <persRef ref="colombi-maria"
								>Countess Colombi’s</persRef>, and examined a travelling Carriage
							which she has for sale, a dormeuse—a very good Carriage but somewhat
							heavy. I Saw the Countess, and her <persRef ref="bode-clementine">Sister

								ref="betancourt-adelina;betancourt-carolina">two Miss
								Betancourt’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi

						<p><date>11. VI. </date>At 12 O’Clock I went with <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> to the Winter Palace, and attended the Te Deum, for
								<persRef ref="vonblucher-gebhard">Marshal Blucher’s</persRef>
							Victory, and the taking of Rheims, par Assaut; and the Cercle
							Diplomatique, afterwards held by the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna"
								>Empress Mother</persRef>. It had been preceded by the Mass, which
							we did not attend. The foreign Ministers were there, excepting the
								<persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier Bardaxi</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Guedes</persRef>. I gave <persRef
								ref="sterky-carl">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sterky</persRef>
							the Agent Géneral from Sweden my letter to <persRef
								ref="engestrom-laurent">Count Engeström</persRef>, enclosed in that
							to <persRef ref="speyer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Speyer</persRef>; he promised to forward it by the earliest possible
							opportunity— I told him I should ask him for Passports which he promised
							to give me. When the Mass was finished the foreign Ministers were
							introduced into the Chapel for the Te Deum, in the performance of which
							there was a variation from the customary manner— The kneeling was
							omitted. They said it was always so at Easter-time. But last year there
							was a Te Deum at the Kazan, Easter-Tuesday, when they knelt as usual.—
							We withdrew from the Chapel just before the Te Deum closed, to be ready
							in the Salle du Trone for the Cercle— I was presented to take leave by
								<persRef ref="u">Prince Tuffekin</persRef>— The Empress asked me
							several questions about my journey, wished it might be pleasant, and
							hoped to see me soon again &amp;c. I offered to take her Majesty’s
							Commands if she had any for that Country, which she received graciously
							and with thanks.— It was a kiss-hands Court, which <persRef
								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef> forgot, and then was
							au desespoir at his inattention— We waited as usual some time after the
							Cercle to go to the <persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand-Duchess
								Ann’s</persRef> Apartments. <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord
								Walpole</persRef> to repose himself literally lay down on the steps
							of the throne— There are no chairs in that Hall, I suppose because it is
							not of etiquette to be seated there. I was presented to the
							Grand-Duchess, to take leave, by her Ecuyer, <persRef ref="u">Count
								Soltykoff</persRef>— Her questions were much the same as those of
							the Empress-Mother. But she asked me whether I intended to go through
							Sweden or through Germany, at which <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg"
								>Jouffroy</persRef> the Prussian Chargé d’Affairs was much diverted.
							She told Jouffroy that he must feel very happy to be the Countryman of
							such a Hero as Marshal Blücher— She spoke to Lord Walpole too about the
							hero <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Wellington</persRef>— Like other
							young Ladies she is a great admirer of Heroes— As there is no abundance
							of Neapolitan heroes she always speaks to the <persRef
								ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de Serra-Capriola</persRef> in
							Italian— In general there was not quite so much triumph and exultation
							at this Court, as there has been at the preceding Te Deum’s these 18
							Months— Count Maistre whose <persRef ref="demaistre-rudolph"
								>son</persRef> is Aide de Camp to <persRef ref="wittgenstein-peter"
								>General Wittgenstein</persRef>, and was wounded with him at Bar sur
							Aube was much dejected— He said that we were singing a Te Deum for some
							Cannons but that the allies had suffered considerable defeats, and great
							losses— That we should see the Moniteur— That the resistance was greater
							than had been expected; that there were divisions among the allies
							&amp;c— Yet they are advancing again on all quarters and are almost at
							the gates of Paris— The real truth is that the French are not in force
							to resist them. <persRef ref="galitzin-woldemar">Princess Woldemar
								Galitzin</persRef> was at the Te Deum, not knowing that her
							Grandson, young <persRef ref="stroganov-alexander">Count
								Strogonoff</persRef> has been killed, though it has been known all
							over the city these ten days.— Count Maistre was informed only by
							accident of his son’s being wounded, and that it was but slightly— He
							mentioned it to the Empress who offered to transmit letters to or from
							him— Vous savez said she, que j’ai d’excellens Commissionaires a l’armée
							a présent— J’ai quatre fils a l’armée, and it gives me many a moment of
							heart-ache— As she went away I said to the Count, Bella matribus
							detestata— Aye, said he; but for <persRef ref="alexander-i;constantine3"
								>her sons</persRef> there is no great danger; though to be sure the
							Ball that killed <persRef ref="moreau-jean">Moreau</persRef>, might have
							struck the Emperor— After we had been at the Grand-Duchess’s Court, we
							went to the Apartments of the <persRef
								ref="alexanderwurttemberg;antoinette">Duke and Duchess of
								Wirtemberg</persRef>, and were written down. The Duke, was present
							at the Te Deum— He commanded at the Siege of Dantzig.— From the Palace I
							went and paid visits by Cards to <persRef ref="litta-ekaterina">Countess
								Litta</persRef>, <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi

								ref="weydemeyer-ivan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Lord Walpole— It was near five O’Clock when we came home. After dinner I
							went with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to the
							Gachellies, and saw the Puppet-Show— Finished the Evening with
							writing.</p>

						<p><date>12. V:30. </date>I paid several visits this morning, previous to my

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Schubert</persRef>, the Imperial
							Astronomer, to whom I returned the Celestial Charts by <persRef
								ref="bode-johann">Bode</persRef>, which he had lent me; and he
							returned me the volume on Comets, and that of <persRef ref="smith-adam"
								>Smith’s</persRef> philosophical Essays, which I had lent him. He
							said he had read them both with great pleasure— That in <persRef
								ref="oliver-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Oliver’s</persRef> Essay upon Comets there was nothing new, as its
							principal idea that the Comets were retained in their orbits by the
							repulsion of the Solar atmosphere had been first advanced by <persRef
								ref="kepler-johannes">Kepler</persRef>, and was set forth in great
							detail by <persRef ref="pingre-alexandre">Pingré</persRef> in a large
							work in two Volumes entitled Cometographie— I observed to him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver’s Essay must have been published
							before Pingre’s work— I asked him if the Planet Mercury could ever be
							seen by the naked eye— He said, not by him; nor by any ordinary eyes—
							That there was a young man, connected with the Academy of Sciences, who
							he did not doubt could at times see Mercury without a glass, for he
							could in a clear day see Venus at Noon— But for himself he could see
							nothing less than a <pb n="88" type="ms"/>star of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> magnitude with the naked eye— In
							Southern Climates, where the sky is clearer, more perhaps might be seen,
							but not here. He said that the light of Mercury was so brilliant, that
							it was necessary to use a coloured glass to view him distinctly.— From
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schubert’s I went to <persRef
								ref="meyer-jc">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer’s</persRef>,
							where I made some necessary arrangements, with respect to my family
							during my absence. I next called upon <persRef ref="hynam-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hynam</persRef>, and returned him the
							Manuscript he lent me last Summer concerning the Russian weights and
							measures. He has two new pair of Scales, one of which he thinks still
							more perfect for small weights than his large one— But upon trial we
							found it less correct. He had also two antient Russian weights; but he
							knew not where made nor when— They were a pound and a quarter of a
							pound— They had the appearance of being made with care, and were marked
							in the 96<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> parts of the Zolotnik—that is
							9216 to the pound. It weighed 6326 grains Troy weight English—that is 6
							3/4 grains more than the standard weight now used at the fortress for
							weighing silver and gold—which yields another proof how excessively
							careless they are here upon this Article— The quarter of a pound
							corresponded very exactly with the pound, and proved that they were
							taken from a standard heavier than that now used— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hynam shewed me again all his apparatus
							for making Arsheens— Of which he told me he had been engaged to make
							500000. that the number wanted, was about four millions, but the war had
							put a stop to the work— His machinery is all extremely ingenious, and of
							his own invention— After returning home I went with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to the Gachellies, two of
							which we saw—the Rope-dancers, Tumblers and feats of horsemanship; and
							the <persRef ref="punch">Punch</persRef> puppet-show, with the
							leger-de-main tricks. About 4 we came home, and I went to look at some

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman</persRef> sent me word

						<p><date>23. VI.15. </date><persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> appointed 11 O’Clock this morning to see me, and
							at that hour I called upon him, and took leave of him— I had about an
							hour’s Conversation with him; embracing a variety of political topics,
							but chiefly of a general nature. He spoke much of his retirement, and
							told me he had written again to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> asking him to accept his resignation. That on the
							one hand he was grateful to the Emperor for his kindness in the
							reluctance he shewed to dismiss him, but on the other he thought he had
							some petits reproches à lui faire for having withheld now for a full
							year his compliance with his request— He said the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef> had sent him word
							that the Courier with the news of the taking of Paris was not arrived;
							but there was an Estafette from the <persRef ref="mariapavlovna">Duchess
								of Weymar</persRef>, confirming the Accounts first received from
							Königsberg, and with further details.— The <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> was said to be
							at Joinville with 70000 men, and the <persRef ref="francis-i">Emperor of
								Austria</persRef> had retired to Dijon, with all the Quartier
							General Diplomatique— I said I supposed the War might be considered as
							finished— The Count replied that with regard to Paris all was finished—
							But if Napoleon was still supported by the army, he thought the recent
							events rather retarded than advanced the end of the War. If all Greece
							demanded to be delivered from the Minotaur, he would be killed, and then
							the affair might be finished— At Bordeaux the People had declared for
							the Bourbons— In Britanny and Normandy there were said to be
							Insurrections in their favour— The <persRef ref="artois-charles">Comte
								d’Artois</persRef> had been at Nancy, and complained that the People
							in those Provinces, who only asked for arms to support the Bourbon cause
							had not received them— But he, the Count knew that since then arms had
							been sent to them from England—not many indeed; because England who
							furnished them to all the world had exhausted herself, of her stock on
							hand, though not of her means of supplying more in future.— But at
							Paris, the place had capitulated— The Senate were to assemble to form a
							Constitution, and the Emperor Alexander in the name of all the allies
							had declared they would not interfere with their deliberations— But the
							people had manifested nothing but <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>— It was
							said they had assumed the white cockade, but that they would of course
							do, in the presence of the allied armies— It was necessary to see what
							would be the consequences— If there was to be a civil War in France, the
							War was not yet near its end. It was not a month since the English
							Newspapers stated that Austria had declared she would change sides with
							150000 men, if the Allies attempted to dethrone Napoleon, and that the
							Emperor Alexander had informed the British Government that it was with
							the greatest pain, he had been obliged to agree to the preliminaries at
							Chatillon— And the English Ministerial prints published this as the
							justification of their Government for assenting to the same— Even now
							the last Berlin Gazettes stated that the Emperor of Austria had been
							received with the greatest acclamations of Joy, by the People at Dijon,
							because he was the <hi rend="italic">father of the <persRef
									ref="marialouisa2">Empress</persRef></hi>— It appeared that
							Austria had however been prevailed upon by Eloquence, or rather by the
							force of Circumstances, to change her policy, for the Emperor Alexander
							had declared at Paris in the name of all the Allies, that he never would
							make Peace with Napoleon, or with any of his supporters.— From all this
							the Court’s conclusion was that the prospects of a general Peace; at
							least he saw no appearance that a state of tranquility was to be
							expected; and as I expressed some anxiety to reach as speedily as
							possible the place of my destination, he said he thought we should lose
							no time, and no chance of eventual success in the negotiation by delay.—
							In my own opinion it makes no difference. The Count hinted that he
							thought it not improbable Bonaparte might pass over into Italy, and make
							a stand there; where he said it appeared the People remained faithful to
							him.— But in reality the only chances remaining to him is how and when
							he shall be killed—a few days sooner or a few days later.— The Count
							also spoke of Spain, of Holland, of Hanover, of the Marriage between the
							Hereditary <persRef ref="william-ii">Prince of Orange</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte of Wales</persRef>— Of
							another Marriage which he said was likely to take place between the
								<persRef ref="adolphus">Duke of Cambridge</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="frederica-sophia">Princess of Solms</persRef>; <pb n="91"
								type="ms"/>the late <persRef ref="louiseauguste">Queen of
								Prussia’s</persRef> Sister; whose present husband the Prince of
							Solms treats her very ill, and has become a common Sot— So she is to be
							divorced from him and to marry the Duke of Cambridge; upon which one of
							the Count’s friends had written him that she was going to exchange a
							drunkard for a Man that gets drunk. I was speaking of the prospect that
							the progeny from the English marriage might unite the Sovereignty of
							Great-Britain with that of Hanover and of Holland; but he said Hanover
							could not descend to, or through a female, and must pass to the younger
							Sons, of the present <persRef ref="george-iii">king of
							England</persRef>—and that Holland was also to be settled upon the
							younger Son of the present <persRef ref="william-i">Prince of
								Orange</persRef>— But he added Holland was a Country divided in
							Sentiment—friends and enemies of the House of Orange; and not likely to
							be quiet or contented under the new Government that may be formed. Spain
							also had a prospect of uneasy and turbulent futurity— He read me from an
							English newspaper, some late occurrences at the Cortes, on the approach
							of <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand VII</persRef> and the
							arrangements making for his reception— But he said they had made a new
							Constitution in Spain, and a King of Spain now would be a very different
							personage from a king of Spain heretofore— I concurred with the Count in
							most of these Opinions, but not in his conclusions. I spoke to him of
							the Note I had sent to <persRef ref="weydemeyer-ivan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weydemeyer</persRef>, and which he
							told me he had not seen— I mentioned my disavowal of the answer stated
							by <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to have
							been given by the <persRef ref="bayard-james;gallatin-albert">American
								Commissioners at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Petersburg</persRef> to the Overture in <persRef
								ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart’s</persRef> Note of 1.
							September— The Count said he had never received any such Note as that of
							Lord Cathcart— He was surprized to hear that it was addressed to
								<persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef>— Indeed he
							had been informed otherwise that Count Nesselrode had meddled with the
							foreign Affairs (s’etoit mêlé des Affaires Etrangères) and he supposed
								<persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> had written to
							Lord Cathcart Reports of Conversations, loose and inofficial, from which
							these assertions of Lord Castlereagh might have arisen— All this
							proceeded from the double mode of transacting business; here through one
							channel and at Head-Quarters through another— But he the Count had
							always been frank and explicit with us— Another might have shuffled and
							equivocated, and as was customary both in France and England, left our
							Notes three or four Months unanswered— That was not his way of doing
							business. He had told us at once, and immediately that he had received
							nothing from the Emperor on the Subject; and the Emperor had forbidden
							Count Nesselrode to write him any thing except merely to transmit
							official documents to him— If we had ever answered as Lord Castlereagh
							pretended let them produce our answer— It must be in writing; for
							nothing but a written document could be such an answer— It was clear
							enough there was none such to produce, for we had more than one Note
							from him, signed by him, and declaring that he had no Communication from
							the Emperor, which we could answer— As to the pretence that we had
							expressed our desire that this business might not be mixed with the
							Affairs of the Continent of Europe, it was absurd, since nothing had
							ever been said of mixing those things together— I told him that my
							Colleagues and myself had been much surprized to see these Statements,
							and I in particular when I compared lord Cathcart’s Note dated 1.
							September 1813. with the Letter from the Emperor to him the Count, dated
							8 September 1813. O.S. and therefore 20 days after the Note, and which
							he the Count had shewn me.— The rest of our Conversation was about
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin and Bayard, <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell</persRef>, <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="todd-john">Todd</persRef>— He asked me when I expected
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris would arrive here; and desired
							me to write to Harris that when he should come, he must call upon him.
							On taking leave of the Count I thanked him for all his civilities to me,
							and he answered with his usual politeness.— I told him I hoped still to
							see him again at the head of the Emperor’s Councils, which he by no
							means admitted, but of which I think he is himself not without hopes—
							From his house, I went and crossed the river and called upon <persRef
								ref="sterky-carl">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sterky</persRef>,
							the Swedish Commercial Agent— I asked him for a Passport, and offered to
							take any packets for him— He promised to call on me Monday, with both.
							Just as I was leaving him <persRef ref="u">Baron Klinköwström</persRef>
							came in with <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, and told me he would
							write by me— I went thence and took <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> from School. We crossed the river and overtook
							the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier Bardaxi</persRef> walking
							on the quay with his <persRef ref="u;u">two children</persRef>— We soon
							after met <persRef ref="litta-giulio">Count Litta</persRef> who told us
							there was this morning an Estafette from the <persRef
								ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">King of Wurtemberg</persRef> further
							confirming the taking of Paris— It was a good a great and a happy piece
							of news; for every thing had passed quietly; and the greatest of all was
							the Declaration, by the Emperor Alexander alone, but speaking in the
							name of all the Allies— This was very proper because he was the one in
							whom the greatest Confidence was to be placed— The Courier was still
							expected, but at Berlin they had already had their firing of Cannon and
							their Illuminations— It was Count Schwerin who had carried the news
							there. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bardaxi told me his news from
							Spain, brought by a Courier to him yesterday— It was the same Count
							Romanzoff had told me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bardaxi said that
							Bonaparte’s system was too violent; it could not stand— He had committed
							two <pb n="92" type="ms"/>great faults; the War with Spain, and the War
							with Russia— He had ruined Spain— But Spain would be indebted to him for
							her liberty and her happiness— Without him, Spain would never have been
							free; and now, within ten years Spain would astonish the world, by the
							wisdom of her Institutions.— I thought these opinions all sufficiently
							correct excepting the last. On returning home, I found at my door,
								<persRef ref="rodde-diedrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rodde</persRef> of Reval, who had received the letter I wrote him
							last week. He had a letter from Reval of the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> when they expected the harbour would not be open, in less
							than a fortnight from that time— I concluded to defer my departure,
							untill next Thursday, I received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Weydemeyer several packets of despatches brought by a Russian Courier
							from London. Dispatches from the Government, and letters from my
								<persRef ref="adams-john">father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>— I dined with <persRef

							part to me; the difficulties to all human appearance insuperable, which
							forbid the hope of success; the universal gloom of the prospect before

						<p>This table contains the itinerary of my journey from S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg to Reval— Upon my application
							to <persRef ref="weydemeyer-ivan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Weydemeyer</persRef>, he sent me a Passport for my self and my
							Servant; with a sealed letter to <persRef ref="u">General
								Wiasmitinoff</persRef> the Military Governor of the City, which I
							sent yesterday to him, on which he furnished me the <hi rend="italic"
								>Padorojna</hi> or Order for Post-horses— The order was for four
							Courier horses, and was to be exhibited to the Post-Master at every
							Station. It mentioned that the road was from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg to Reval—that it was 341 Versts, the horses to
							be paid for at the rate fixed by the Ukazes, and that 27 Rubles 28
							Copeeks, that is 8 Copeeks per Verst was paid for this Padorojna.— For
							the horses the first Stage, to Strelna the charge was seven Copeeks for
							each horse per Verst, and the rest of the Road 5 Copeeks per Verst and
							horse— At each stage I paid 50 Copeeks to the Postilion, and 25 Copeeks
							to the Starost, or Peasant who furnished the horses.— They were all
							satisfied with this, and never asked for more— I have marked down in the
							table the legal payments at each Stage, including the 75 Copeeks to the
							Postilion and Starost— The first Stage also includes the 28 Rubles for
							the Padorojna, the Governor’s Clerk who made it out having kept the odd
							Copeeks for himself. My actual payments were in some instances more than
							I have here set down, but the difference was a mere trifle. I have also
							marked the time of my arrival at each Stage, and of my departure from
							it; which will shew the average rate of travelling, and the time of
							detention at each Post-house for the horses. It was never less than half
							an hour, and seldom much more, excepting <pb n="94" type="ms"/>when I
							stopp’d to take some refreshment, or to have the wheels of the Carriage
							greased.— I found the roads this Evening excessively rough— The Snow was
							gone almost universally— The frost had come out of the ground making the
							roads deep and they were now frozen hard again— The weather was cold,
							but the Night clear; and with a Moon nearly at the full.— I concluded
							therefore to travel the whole Night. At Koskova, I remarked the
							conjunction of the Moon and Jupiter.</p>

						<p><date>29. </date>At the two Stages from Koskova to Opolié, which I
							travelled between 1 and 5 O’Clock this morning there was still some
							depth of Snow, and the roads were worse than upon any other part of the
							road. I breakfasted at Jamburg, and crossed the river Luga there, about
							9. The road to Narva from the river is in a straight line, and fine as a
							turnpike. The Post house at Narva is without the City which I therefore
							did not enter. Crossed the river Narova just below it— This Circumstance
							of the Post house’s being without the City I suppose is the Cause that
							two Versts more are charged for on the Stage which enters the City, from
							either side. But when the traveller does not enter the City, as was my
							case, they do not charge the additional Versts for both Stages. I
							crossed the river, just at Noon, under the salutation of 30 or 40 Guns,
							which on enquiry, I found were fired in rejoycing for the taking of
							Paris— At the Post-Office at Chudleigh the name was painted upon the
							door of the house. The place is grossly misspelt on the Post-map, and in
							the Books. I asked the Post-master how it came by its English name— He
							said that the Estate upon which it was built, had been purchased by the
								<persRef ref="pierrepont-elizabeth">Duchess of Kingston</persRef>,
							and that she had long resided at the Chateau, in view of the place where
							we stood, and which he pointed out to me— That the name of the place had
							been Fokenoff, which sounded hässlich in English; for which reason the
							Duchess had changed it for her own maiden-name— I met here a traveller;
							almost the only one I had seen upon the road; with the exception of two
							Couriers; one last Night, and one this morning; and both beyond Narva
							towards S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— This traveller asked
							me if there was any late news from the Armies at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg— I told him of the taking of Paris— He said he
							knew that; but shook his head, and said he feared the worst danger was
							yet to come.— I had neither time nor inclination to enquire into the
							motives of his fears, and wished him a pleasant Journey— The same
							Post-master at Chudleigh gave me, and charged me for six horses instead
							of four, which from S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg to that
							place had been sufficient for me. Several of the preceding Starosts had
							indeed spoken of six horses, but <persRef ref="colombi-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Colombi</persRef> had told me her
							husband never had travelled in it with more than four, and I knew not
							that more than four were required by the ordinances. This Post-Master
							had the printed Ordinances suspended at the Wall of the room where I
							waited for the change of the horses— They were dated in 1801. 1808 and
							1812. the last at Willna— It regulates the price to be paid for the
							horses; at 5 Copeeks for each horse per Verst<hi rend="strikethrough"
								>s</hi>—in this and the neighbouring Governments. It had been
							previously only 3 Copeeks per Verst; and before the paper Currency only
							two. The Ordinance of 1808 prescribed the number of horses to be taken
							and charged for every sort of Carriage from two horses to ten— The
							number for each kind of vehicle is increased by one or two, at the two
							Seasons of the Year when the roads are broken up— Thus the two seated
							Coach; with trunks, and two or three Persons, takes four horses from 15
							December to 15 March, and from 15 May to 15 September— During the rest
							of the year the same Carriage and burden must take six horses. My
							Carriage is of this description, and in the heavy parts of the road
							really needed the six horses— The breed of these horses is peculiar to
							the Country. They are very small; very wretched in appearance, and very
							weak; which last quality must be owing to their bad keeping— For they
							are hardy—they endure the extremities of the Cold as if it was their
							natural temperature, and they are fleet— The price charged for horses is
							lower than in any other Country in Europe. And they exact much more from
							travellers who have not the Padorojna for Courier horses. It has not
							even been increased in proportion to the depretiation of the Paper; for
							two Copeeks in silver are equal to eight of Copper or Paper.— We arrived
							at Wargel between 10 and 11 in the Evening.— The weather had changed and
							it began to Snow. I determined therefore to stop for the Night, and had
							my bed made in a room which they allowed me at the Post-house.</p>

						<p><date>30. IV. </date>They gave me a Breakfast of very good Coffee, and
							rye-bread— The Post-master attempted to charge me nearly double the
							fixed price for his horses, but desisted upon my asking him for an
							explanation. At six, I entered the Carriage— There had fallen so much
							Snow in the Night that the ground was entirely covered— It continued to
							Snow at intervals all the first part of the day. In the afternoon it
							cleared away, but still continued very cold. In the course of the day I
							read the pamphlet upon expatriation, sent me by <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							the Secretary of State. <persRef ref="strong-nathaniel">M<hi

								George Hay</persRef> who married <persRef ref="hay-eliza">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s daughter</persRef>. The
							author appears to me to have proved beyond all possibility of reply the
							falsehood, absurdity and tyranny of the doctrine of perpetual
							allegiance— But I cannot altogether reconcile my self to his doctrine of
							the unqualified right of expatriation. <pb n="95" type="ms"/>I consider
							the social compact as bilateral— Allegiance and Protection as reciprocal
							and corresponding obligations of the Subject and Sovereign— But it is a
							compact, and I cannot think it dissoluble at the mere pleasure of either
							party.— I also began this day to read <persRef ref="clark-thomas"
								>Clark’s</persRef> naval History of the United States.— Stopp’d
							about an hour and dined at Loop. I had proceeded about four Versts from
							Kahal, the last Stage but one before Reval, when between 8 and 9 in the
							Evening <persRef ref="gahlroos-axel">my Servant</persRef> discovered
							that the Crane Neck of the Carriage was broken entirely off. We
							proceeded with much difficulty about three Versts further, to the next
							Village, where with the Assistance of several peasants the broken parts
							of the Carriage were lashed together so that we were enabled between
							Midnight, and one in the morning to reach the Post-Station at Jegelicht—
							On descending from the Carriage we found that the first accident had
							occasioned a second and more serious one. My Servants Portmanteau,
							containing all his Clothes and all the money he had was lashed on in
							front of the Carriage, and under his own Seat— After the Carriage was
							broken it became necessary to remove it, and he lashed it on the trunk
							behind. When we arrived at the Station it was gone— Whether the ropes
							which had held it were cut away, or had been worn off by the friction,
							was not perfectly clear— We had seen no person upon the road; and Axel
							thought he had seen his Portmanteau still on the Trunk about 8 Versts
							behind the Post-house— I stopp’d here untill the morning, to give him
							time to go back, and see if he could find it on the road. The Mail for
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg from Reval was going
							through, about two hours after, and I wrote by it a few lines to
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— I then had
							my Mattrass thrown upon a Sopha, and laid down, without being able to
							sleep from two untill about six in the Morning.</p>
