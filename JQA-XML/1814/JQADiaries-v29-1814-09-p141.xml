						<p><date>1. IV. </date>This morning I paid a visit to the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="goulburn-jane"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goulburn</persRef>— I did not
							however see her; but only her husband— Lord Gambier and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams, with <persRef ref="baker-anthony"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, went yesterday
							to Bruxelles, to return on Saturday. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn told me that after having prepared their note in reply to ours,
							from the great importance of the subject, they had thought best to
							transmit it to their Government for approbation before they sent it in
							to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert;clay-henry;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>us</persRef>— He said he expected their messenger this Evening, and
							I enquired whether he expected to receive by him the answer to their
							last reference— He said that would depend on the time which it took
							their dispatch to arrive in England; but he thought it more probable
							that the answer would come next Sunday. That their Messengers came
							regularly twice a week; on Thursdays and Sundays— I told him I hoped his
							Government would reconsider some parts of their former propositions,
							before they sent their final instruction— He did not think it probable;
							and I found the more I conversed with him, the more the violence and
							bitterness of his Passion against the United States disclosed itself.
							His great point in support of the Indian boundary, was its necessity for
							the security of Canada.— He said that the United States had manifested
							the intention and the determination of conquering Canada— That
							“excepting us,” he believed it was the astonishment of the whole world,
							that Canada had not been conquered at the very out-set of the War— That
							nothing had saved it but the excellent dispositions and military
							arrangements of the <persRef ref="prevost-george">Governor</persRef>,
							who commanded there— That in order to guard against the same thing in
							future it was necessary to make a barrier against our settlements, upon
							which neither party should encroach. That the Indians were but a
							secondary object; but that as being the allies of Great-Britain, she
							must include them, as she made Peace with other Powers, including
							Portugal, as her ally— That the proposition that we should stipulate not
							to arm upon the Lakes, was made with the same purpose—the security of
							Canada— He could not see that there was any thing humiliating in it—
							That the United States could never be in any danger of invasion from
							Canada— The disproportion of force was too great— But Canada must always
							be in the most imminent danger of invasion from the United States,
							unless she was guarded by some such stipulations as they now demanded—
							That it could be nothing to the United States to agree not to arm upon
							the Lakes; since they never had actually done it before the present War—
							Why should they object to disarming there, where they had never before
							had a gun floating? I answered that the Conquest of Canada had never
							been an object of the War on the part of the United States. That Canada
							had been invaded by us, in consequence of the War, as they themselves
							had invaded many parts of the United-States. It was an effect, and not a
							Cause of the War— That the American Government never had declared the
							intention of conquering Canada— He referred to <persRef
								ref="hull-william">Hull’s</persRef> Proclamation— I answered that
							the Government was not answerable for that; any more than the British
							Government was answerable for <persRef ref="cochrane-alexander">Admiral
								Cochrane’s</persRef> Proclamations which had been disavowed— He said
							that the American Government had not disavowed Hull’s Proclamation; and
							that no Proclamation of Admiral Cochrane’s had been disavowed by the
							British Government.— I replied that the American Government had never
							been called upon either to avow or disavow Hull’s Proclamation; but that
							I had seen in a printed Statement of the debates in in the House of
							Commons that <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> had been called upon to say whether Admiral
							Cochrane’s Proclamation had been authorized or not, and had answered
							that it was not. He said that Lord Castlereagh had been asked whether a
							Proclamation of Admiral Cochrane’s, encouraging the negroes to revolt;
							had been authorized by the Government, and had answered in the negative;
							that is that no proclamation, encouraging the negroes to revolt had been
							authorized—but the Proclamation of Admiral Cochrane as referred to gave
							no such encouragement; there was nothing about negroes in it— It merely
							offered employment or a settlement in the British Colonies to such
							persons as might be disposed to leave the United States— I referred him
							to the term free, used in connection with that of settlements, and
							observed that it was true the word negroes was not used in it, but that
							no person in America could mistake its meaning— That it was
							unquestionably intended to <hi rend="strikethrough">the</hi> apply to
							the negroes, and that the practice of many of their naval commanders
							corresponded with it— That it was known some of them under such
							inducements had taken away blacks, who had afterwards been sold in the
							West-India Islands— Upon this he manifested some apparent agitation, and
							said that he could undertake to deny in the most unqualified terms— That
							the character of British naval Officers was universally known; their
							generosity and humanity could not be contested; and besides, that since
							the Act of Parliament, of 1811. the act of selling any man for a Slave,
							unless real Slaves from one British Island to another was felony without
							benefit of clergy. I replied that without contesting the character of
							any class of People generally, it was certain there would be in all
							Classes, individuals, capable of committing actions, of which others
							would be ashamed— That at a great distance from the eye and controul of
							the Government, acts were often done, with impunity, which would be
							severely punished nearer home— That the facts I had stated to him, were
							among the objects which we were instructed to present for Consideration,
							if the Negotiation should proceed, and he might in that case find it
							more susceptible of proof then he was aware— He thought it impossible;
							but that it was one of those charges against their officers, of which
							there were many, originating only in the spirit of hostility and totally
							destitute of foundation— With respect to <pb n="142" type="ms"/>the
							Indian allies I remarked that there was no analogy between them and the
							case of Portugal— That the stipulation which might be necessary for the
							protection of Indians, situated within the boundaries of the United
							States, who had taken the British side in the War, was rather in the
							nature of an amnesty, than of a provision for allies— It resembled more
							the case of Subjects who in cases of invasion, sometimes took part with
							the enemy, as had sometimes occurred to G. Britain in Ireland— He
							insisted that the Indians must be considered as Independent Nations, and
							that we ourselves made Treaties with them;—and acknowledged boundaries
							of their Territories— I said that wherever they would form settlements
							and cultivated Lands their possessions were undoubtedly to be respected,
							and always were respected by the United States. That some of them had
							become civilized in a considerable degree, the Cherokees for example,
							who had permanent habitations and a state of property like our own. But
							the greater part of the Indians could never be prevailed upon to adopt
							this mode of life—their habits, and attachments, and prejudices were so
							averse to any settlement that could not reconcile themselves to any
							other condition than that of wandering hunters. It was impossible for
							such People ever to be said to have Possessions— Their only right upon
							Land was a right to use it as hunting-grounds, and when those Lands
							where they hunted, became necessary or convenient for the purposes of
							settlement, the system adopted by the United States was by amicable
							arrangement with them, to compensate them for renouncing the right of
							hunting upon them, and for removing to remoter regions better suited to
							their purposes and mode of life— This system of the United States was an
							improvement upon the former practice of all European Nations, including
							the British. The original settlers of New-England had set the first
							example of this liberality towards the Indians, which was afterwards
							followed by the founder of Pennsylvania. Between it, and taking the
							Lands for nothing, or exterminating the Indians who had used them there
							was no alternative— To condemn vast regions of territory, to perpetual
							barrenness and Solitude, that a few hundred Savages might find wild
							beasts to hunt upon it was a species of game-Law, that a Nation
							descended from Britons would never endure— It was as incompatible with
							the moral as with the physical nature of things— If Great-Britain meant
							to preclude forever the People of the United States from settling and
							cultivating those Territories she must not think of doing it by a
							Treaty— She must formally undertake and accomplish their utter
							extermination— If the Government of the United States should ever submit
							to such a stipulation which I hoped they would not, all its force, and
							all that of Britain combined with it, would not suffice to carry it long
							into execution— It was opposing a feather to a torrent. The Population
							of the United States in 1810. passed seven Millions— At this hour it
							undoubtedly passed eight— As it continued to increase in such
							proportions, was it in human experience or in human power to check its
							progress by a bond of paper purporting to exclude posterity from the
							natural means of subsistence which they would derive from the
							cultivation of the soil? Such a Treaty instead of closing the old
							sources of dissension would only open new ones. A War thus finished
							would immediately be followed by another, and Great-Britain would
							ultimately find that she must substitute the project of exterminating
							the whole American People, to that of opposing against them her Barrier
							of Savages.— What, said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn, is it
							then in the inevitable nature of things that the United States must
							conquer Canada?— “No”— “But what security then can Great-Britain have
							for her Possession of it?” If Great-Britain does not think a liberal and
							amicable course of policy towards America would be the best security, as
							it certainly would, she must rely upon her general strength, upon the
							superiority of her power in other parts of her relations with America;
							upon the power which she has upon another element to indemnify herself,
							by sudden impression upon American interests, more defenceless against
							her superiority, and in their amount far more valuable than Canada ever
							was or ever will be— He recurred again to our superior force, and to the
							necessity of providing against it— He said that in Canada, they never
							took any of the Indian Lands, and the Government (meaning the Provincial
							Government) was prohibited even from granting them— That there were
							among the Indians, very civilized People, and there was particularly one
							whom he knew, <persRef ref="norton-john2">Norton</persRef>, who
							commanded some of those engaged with them in this War, and who was a
							very intelligent and well-informed man— That this removing of the
							Indians from their Lands to others, was the very thing they complained
							of— That it drove them over into their Provinces and made them encroach
							upon the Indians in their Provinces— This was a new idea to me; I told
							him I had never heard any complaint of this kind before; and I supposed
							a remedy for it, would very easily be found— He made no reply, and
							seemed as if in the pressure for an argument he had advanced more than
							he was inclined to maintain— It was the same with regard <pb n="143"
								type="ms"/>to the proposal that we should keep no armed force on or
							near the Lakes of Canada. He did not admit there was any thing
							humiliating or unusual in it; but he evaded repeatedly answering the
							question how he or the English Nation would feel if the proposition were
							made to them of binding themselves by such a Stipulation— I finally said
							that if he did not feel that there was any thing dishonourable to the
							party, submitting to such terms, it was not a subject susceptible of
							argument— I could assure him that we and our Nation would feel it to be
							such— That such stipulations were indeed often extorted from the
							weakness of a vanquished enemy; but they were always felt to be
							dishonourable, and had certainly occasioned more Wars than they had ever
							prevented— After changing the subject of the Conversation to the
							pictures, which we and they had drawn at the Lottery, I took my leave
							and returned home— In reflecting upon it I remark 1. The inflexible
							determination to adhere to the Indian Boundary and Barrier. 2<hi
								rend="superscript">dly.</hi> The avowal of Cochrane’s proclamation
							to the negroes, and the explanation of Lord Castlereagh’s disavowal. 3.
							The bitterness, and rancour against the Americans, and the Jealousy at
							their increasing strength and population. 4. The irritability at the
							statement of facts, relative to the sale of the Blacks, enticed away;
							and at the comparison between their employing our Indians against us,
							and Irish Subjects, aiding a French invader— Goulburn is personally the
							most inveterate of the three Plenipotentiaries, and the most in the
							Confidence of his Government.— We had a large Company of Ladies and
							Gentlemen to dinner— The <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Intendant
								of the Department of the Scheldt,Count D’Hane de

							of music in the room adjoining our dining-Hall; who performed at
							intervals during the dinner time and all the Evening— Our Garden was
							illuminated with variegated coloured lamps, and after dinner we walked
							in it, half an hour with the Ladies— The Intendant left us about 8 in
							the Evening to go and examine his dispatches. All the rest of the
							Company remained and we spent the Evening at Cards. I played with the
							Intendants Lady, Madame Meulemeester and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cornelissen— The party broke up about Midnight, and after they were
							gone, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay won from me, at a game of all

							of the french Conquest of this Country— They returned in 1803. M<hi

								ref="calvert-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							morning visit from a <persRef ref="dony-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dony</persRef>, who brought some samples of Zinc, of
							which he has a manufactory at Liege. He and his company had already
							written us a Letter on the subject— He was very inquisitive whether we
							should make peace or not? upon which, I could give no certain
							information.— We had our usual meeting of the <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert;clay-henry;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef> from 2 to 4. O’Clock. We concluded to send our
							Note to the <persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Commissioners</persRef> requesting a Passport<hi
								rend="strikethrough">s</hi> for the Herald to take out our
							dispatches, and Passports for a number of American Citizens to go as
							Passengers in her. <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef> took my draught of
							the Note to copy and send. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							produced his Analysis of the last Note from the British Commissioners,
							and his minutes of the points to be noticed in answering it. We
							discussed them, and it was agreed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin should draft an answer, conformably to his minutes, to be
							presented at our Meeting to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Bayard manifested symptoms of inclining to concessions on the points
							proposed by the British Commissioners, and which we have rejected. He
							proposed offering to the British Commissioners for the Indians a statu
							quo ante Bellum; or a declaration that we do not consider the Treaty of
							Greenville as abrogated— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and myself
							were for admitting no stipulations about the Indians in a Treaty with
							England. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed to offer at
							least to refer to our Government a stipulation for disarming on both
							sides, on the Lakes— I objected our positive Instructions, and produced
							them— I proposed to take the grounds that the very employment of Indians
							by G. Britain was contrary to the Laws of War, and that she had a
							sufficient pledge for the security of Canada, from sudden invasion, by
							the mass of our floating Commerce upon which by her superiority at Sea,
							she could always lay as suddenly her hand. It was agreed to take this
							last point as I proposed, but not the other. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard <pb n="145" type="ms"/>was absent during great part
							of the meeting. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin suggested the
							idea, that after the rupture of the Negotiation our Government might
							keep Ministers in Europe, always empowered to resume it, whenever there
							might be an opportunity. We had a short dinner, and in the Evening I
							took a Solitary walk of two hours round the Ramparts— This morning an
							American by the name of <persRef ref="u">Wilson</persRef> came to me
							stating himself to be in distress, and wanting to get home to America.—
							He had been already to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— He together with two others,
							named <persRef ref="u">Prescott</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Taylor</persRef> have been advertised in the English Newspapers, as
							having broken their paroles, and escaped.— He acknowledged to me that he
							had broken his Parole, but said he had done it for the best. That there
							was no honour in the Transport board. They had kept him more than a year
							confined in a prison ship. He had been taken in July 1812, going from
							the West-Indies to the United States, immediately after the declaration
							of War and when he knew not that the War existed— He had been supercargo
							of the vessel, and had been very active in an attempt to retake her,
							which unfortunately did not succeed. And that he was to have been sent
							home in one of the first Cartels that went, but was sick when she sailed
							and could not embark in her. His hope now was to have embarked in the
							John Adams— That I told him would have been out of the question if she
							had been here.— We might compassionate his distress, but we could give
							no countenance to the breach of a Parole of Honour. Its tendency was to
							aggravate the sufferings of other and innocent Prisoners; and we should
							justly make it a reproach to the British Government if they were to
							countenance a breach of Parole by any of their Subjects, prisoners to
							us.</p>

							with having carried off public monies, in his charges had taken the
							direction towards Ghent, to apply to us for a Passport to go to America,
							and as it was necessary to secure such a dangerous man, we were required
							if he should make such an application to us, to have him arrested, and
							to give the Prince information of it— The Prince is Commander in Chief
							of all the English troops, and troops in English pay, in the
							Netherlands— It became a question what should be done with this Letter—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin doubted whether we should
							answer it at all— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was for
							answering that we would comply with requisition— I was for answering;
							but not for complying with the requisition, nor for promising that we
							would— The requisition itself appeared to me, an infringement of our
							immunities as Public Ministers. We can certainly be amenable to no
							military requisition, and most especially to none of an English General
							Officer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard finally drafted a short
							answer, acknowledging the receipt of the Prince’s Letter, and saying
							that we grant no Passports to foreigners to go to America— We took it

							the uneasiness of <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

							The British Note is overbearing and insulting in its <hi
								rend="strikethrough"><unclear>tone?</unclear></hi> like the two
							former ones; but it abandons a great part of the sine qua non, adhering
							at the same time inflexibly to the remainder. The effect of these notes,
							upon us all, when they first come is to deject us all— We so fondly
							cling to the vain hope of Peace, that every new proof of its
							impossibility operates upon us as a disappointment— We had a desultory
							and general conversation, upon this Note, in which I thought both M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard shewed symptoms of despondency— In discussing with
							them, I cannot always restrain the irritability of my temper,— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard meets it with more of accommodation
							than heretofore, and sometimes with more compliance than I expect— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin having more pliability of
							character, and more playfulness of disposition throws off my heat with a
							joke. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell, are perfectly firm themselves, but sometimes
							partake of the staggers of the two other Gentlemen— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said this day that the Sine qua
							non, now presented, that the Indians should be positively included in
							the Peace, and placed in the state they were in before the War, would
							undoubtedly be rejected by our Government, if it was now presented to
							them— But that it was a bad point for us to break off the Negotiation
							upon— That the difficulty of carrying on the War, might compel us to
							admit the principle at last, for now the British had so committed
							themselves with regard to the Indians, that it was impossible for them
							further to retreat. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was the same
							opinion; and recurred to his fundamental idea of breaking off upon some
							point which shall unite our own People in the support of the War. In
							this sentiment we all concur— But as its tendency is to produce
							compliance with the British claims, it is necessary to guard against its
							leading us in that career too far.— I said it was not more clear to me
							that the British would not finally abandon their present Sine qua non,
							than it had been that they would adhere to their first— That if the
							Point of the Indians, was a bad point to break upon, I was very sure we
							should never find a good one— If that would not unite our People, it was
							a hopeless pursuit— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin repeated
							with a very earnest look that it was a bad point to break upon— Then,
							said I, with a movement of impatience, and an angry tone, it is a good
							point to admit the British as the Sovereigns and protectors of our
							Indians— Gallatin’s countenance brightened, and he said in a tone of
							perfect good humour, “that’s a non sequitur.”— This turned the edge of
							the argument into mere jocularity— I laughed, and insisted that it was a
							sequitur, and the conversation easily changed to another point. The
							Gentlemen agreed to make out between them, (M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay and <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef>) a copy of the Note,
							from which a second Press-Copy should be taken— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin should then have the Original to
							make the Analysis of it for to-morrow’s Meeting— The passion for making
							our answer short was again avowed, and again opposed by me— I urged M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to spare neither his paper, nor
							the time of our adversaries; and to be careful to leave nothing
							important unanswered— I have at the same time offered to subscribe any
							answer, which any one of the Gentlemen would draw up in half a page, and
							would himself sign as our answer— My principle has been that if we do
							enter upon argument, it ought to be at full length— I also made the
							proposal of offering to the British an Article, including the Indians,
							in the nature of an amnesty; for which I thought we should be warranted
							by our Instruction to endeavour to obtain an amnesty for the Canadians
							who have taken part with us— I had already several times suggested this
							idea, which had not been admitted, or rejected— It was not now agreed
							to, but left for consideration. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell
							had a letter for us from <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

							rested upon myself— I have thus the advantage of presenting for
							consideration whatever appears important to myself, and I oblige myself
							to give all possible attention to the subjects in controversy, and to
							the grounds of our adversaries. I began therefore this morning a draft
							of an Answer to their last Note, and wrote upon it, almost without
							intermission until dinner time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							was engaged at the same time upon his draft but did not finish it— I
							gave him the first sheet of my draft to make what use of it he pleased—
							He sent the first sheet of his to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Bayard and Clay for their consideration— In the Evening, I walked half
							an hour on the Place d’Armes, and spent an hour with <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef> at the Hotel des Pays-Bas. I had this morning a
							French Officer, who came, and wanted to go to America, and enter into
							our service; merely from his detestation of the English, and his desire
							to fight against them— He had been in all the Campaigns in Russia, and
							was slightly wounded at the passage of the Beresino. We have a great
							number of applications of this kind, and I have suspected some of them
							to have been sent here by our adverse party, to spy out, whether we
							would engage officers for the War— We have also had many applications in
							writing to the same effect, none of which we have answered.</p>

							and he produced his draft as finished. It was read together with parts

								>r</hi> Gallatin to mark off what was to be retained of both, to be
							then sent round and revised by us all preparatory to the second
							presentation of it as a draft to be decided upon by a joint
							deliberation. The two original drafts were about of the same length; but
							the views taken of the contested points were materially different. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s chiefly consisted of two
							arguments, one concerning the Boundary of the District of Maine, and the
							other concerning the condition of the Indians— My arguments on these
							topics were very short, but I had replied at large to the accusatory
							matter of the British Note, had retorted pointedly upon the Britons
							their own charges, and insisted on the moral and religious duty of the
							American Nation to cultivate their territory, though to the necessary
							extintion of all the rights of Savage tribes, by fair and amicable
							means. I had also the proposal for the Article of amnesty, to include
							the Indians— It was agreed to adopt this Article, though with objections
							to almost every word in which I had drawn it up— This is a severity with
							which I alone am treated, in our discussions, by all my Colleagues—
							Almost every thing written by any of the rest is rejected or agreed to
							with very little criticism verbal or substantial— But every line that I
							write passes a gauntlet of objections by every one of my Colleagues,
							which finally issues for the most part in the rejection of it all— I
							write and propose a great-deal more than all the rest together, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin excepted. I have in the end I
							believe not more than my fifth part in the papers as we dispatch them—
							This must be in a great measure the fault of my composition, and I ought

						<p><date>25. IV:45. </date>I found it impossible to make a suitable revision
							of the Papers for the draft of our Note, without attempting to make a
							new draft of great part of it, which I accordingly attempted. Before I
							had finished it <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> came into my chamber, and shewed some
							impatience for a meeting.— I was prepared about Noon.— <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> was gone out to Breakfast. We found in <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s</persRef>
							chamber some English Newspapers; among which the Times of the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st:</hi> containing the British Lieut<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							<persRef ref="drummond-gordon">General Drummond’s</persRef> official
							account of the Battle of 25 July; the first of our defeats of which a
							long and heavy series is before us. There was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mifflin</persRef>, last from Hamburg,
							and lately from England in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s
							chamber— <persRef ref="bayard-james">We</persRef> met at one O’Clock,
							and sat until past five debating the new draft of our answer to the
							British Note— I had proposed to leave out a large part of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft; but he insisted upon
							retaining most of what he had written and it was retained.— In this
							debate I had continual evidence of two things— One that if any one
							member objects to any thing I have written; all the rest support him in
							it, and I never can get it through— The other that if I object to any
							thing written by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, unless he
							voluntarily abandons it, every other member supports him, and my
							objection is utterly unavailing— They supported him thus this day in a
							paragraph respecting Florida, directly in the face of our Instructions,
							which I produced and read. I was reduced to the necessity of declaring
							that I would not sign the paper with the paragraph as he had drawn it—
							He objected to mine because it said that the proceedings of the American
							Government could be completely justified with regard to Florida—
							Gallatin said that he did not think they could— That he had opposed for
							a whole year, what had been done before he could succeed in stopping the
							course they had taken— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that
							he was very much committed on the subject of Florida too; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay though he thought the Government
							perfectly justiable, did not perceive any necessity for saying so. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell was of the same opinion— I had no
							alternative but to say I would not sign the paper with the paragraph as
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had written it—for that
							pointedly said that we would not discuss the subject of Florida with the
								<persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, though our Instructions had expressly
							authorized us to bring it before them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin finally consented himself to take my paragraph with an
							alteration— On the other hand, in repelling an insolent charge of the
							British Plenipotentiaries against the Government of the United States of
							a system of perpetual encroachment upon the Indians under the pretence
							of purchases, I had taken the ground of the moral religious duty of a
							Nation to settle, cultivate and improve their territory—a principle
							perfectly recognized by the Laws of Nations, and in my own opinion the
							only solid and unanswerable defence against the charge in the British
							Note— Gallatin, saw and admitted the weight of the argument; but was
							afraid of ridicule— Bayard too since he has been reading Vattel agreed
							in the argument, and was willing to say it was a duty— But the terms
							God, and Providence and Heaven, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							thought were canting, and Russell laughed at them. I was obliged to give
							them up, and with them what I thought the best argument we had.— My
							proposal of the amnesty passed more smoothly, and almost without
							alteration— There were indeed marks for erasure which would have
							demolished it entirely, but which had been made before the Gentlemen had
							recurred to the printed precedents of former Treaties. fortunately all
							the most perilous words of my draft were found used in the precedents,
							and the objections against them vanished.— Among the parts of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s Note which I had proposed to
							strike out was a pointed question to the British Plenipotentiaries, to
							which I objected, because I thought it admitted of a solid answer, and
							because so far as it was not answerable it had been substantially put in
							both our former Notes. He adhered to it, and my objection was overruled—
							He had one passage saying that the Sovereignty of the territory in
							question was transferred by the Treaty of Peace of 1783. from the
								<persRef ref="george-iii">king of Great-Britain</persRef> to the
							United States, which I told him was a tremendous concession— He
							contended at first even for that; but was soon convinced it could not be
							maintained, and gave it up, without debate— We postponed our dinner,
							until between five and six, and agreed at last to the draft as it was to
							be copied; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin taking his paragraphs
							which I had proposed to strike out, but which are to be retained, to
							alter them as he thinks proper, as he found some alteration of them
							would be necessary. In the Evening I went to the Theatre, and saw
							Gulistan ou le Hulla de Samarcand, with Adolphe et Clara, ou les deux
							Prisonniers.— There is a new Tenor Singer, named <persRef ref="u"
								>Desfossée</persRef>, from Bruxelles, who performs the first parts,
							very well. <persRef ref="meulemeester-therese">Madame
								Meulemeester</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Madame Van
