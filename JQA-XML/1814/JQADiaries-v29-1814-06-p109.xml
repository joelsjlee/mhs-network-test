						<p><date>1. VI:45. </date>Having determined to take my departure for
							Gothenburg to-morrow, I called on <persRef ref="speyer-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer</persRef> this Morning to make
							my arrangements for that purpose. I gave him 50 dutch ducats which he
							undertook to get exchanged for Swedish money. I took them with me as the
							money in most general Circulation throughout the North of Europe, but I
							find there will be some loss upon the exchange of them here— I am
							obliged to hire a driver for my Carriage, the Peasants who furnish
							Post-Horses being able to drive no other Carriages than their little
							Waggons— I must also send on a Messenger, a day before hand to order my
							horses at the several Stages. I determined to send on <persRef
								ref="gahlroos-axel">my servant Axel</persRef>, as the forebudd to
							order my horses, and I engaged another man named <persRef
								ref="ericson-niels">Ericson</persRef>, to drive my Carriage— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer recommended to me to go from here
							about six O’Clock in the Evening, for the convenience of obtaining
							horses with more certainty— He made out three lists of the Stages, which
							I signed and sealed—the first from hence to Oerebro; which I gave to
							Axel to take on with him— At Oerebro he is to wait for my arrival, and
							then immediately to proceed with the second list; about half way to
							Gothenburg— There he is to wait for me again; and then go on the third
							days Journey which is to bring me, by this Calculation to Gothenburg.—
							The hours at which he is to order the horses are all marked down on the
							first list; but I kept the two others, to ascertain by experience how I
							shall get along by this mode of travelling with my Carriage— Axel went
							from hence between 11 and 12 O’Clock this Evening. I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer to a bookseller’s shop, and
							purchased a Post-map of Sweden. The English Mail of 13 May. arrived this
							day. <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> had a Letter from <persRef ref="beasley-reuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef> of that date,
							informing him that the <pb n="110" type="ms"/>British Government had
							appointed three Commissioners, to meet those of the United
								States—<persRef ref="gambier-james">Admiral Lord Gambier</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="adams-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adam</persRef>, a Lawyer, and <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouldsbourn</persRef>, a Secretary in the Colonial Department. That
							the British Government would probably propose in form the removal of the
							Seat of Negotiations from Gothenburg to Holland; and that it was to be
							decided the day after he wrote— I made however a draft of a Letter to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>,
							notifying our Appointment, and our readiness to meet the British
							Commissioners at Gothenburg; which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Russell after making some alteration in it signed, and which I am to
							take on to Gothenburg, to be forwarded, if the removal to Holland has
							not been finally agreed upon.— I went with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell, <persRef ref="russell-george">his Son</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="lawrence-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> to the Arsenal, and saw the Collection of
							Curiosities deposited there. Complete sets of steel armour for knights
							worn by the king’s of Sweden, from the time of the <persRef ref="birgerjarl">Statthalter Birger
							Jarl</persRef> in the 13<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Century; to the Carousel
							Armours of the two last kings— Trophies, taken in War, from the time of
								<persRef ref="gustavus-vasa">Gustavus Vasa</persRef>, down to the
							present <persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">Crown Prince</persRef>
							inclusively; for there are some danish Standards taken in Holstein last
							December.— One of them the man who shews the things told us the <persRef
								ref="charles-xiii">king</persRef> had sent for last week to have at
							the Palace, at the reception of the Crown Prince, who has arrived at
							Carlskrona, and is expected at Stockholm the day after to-morrow. There
							is nothing at this place of much curiosity, but the Clothes of <persRef
								ref="charles-xii">Charles the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi></persRef> which he wore when he was killed— Hat, Gloves,
							Coat, Waistcoat, Breeches, Shirt, Stockings, upper and under Boots and
							Sword— The stain of blood is yet on the gloves and sword-hilt— There is
							also a large staff upon which it is said he was leaning when he was
							killed. The hole made by the bullet through the hat is so precisely at
							the spot which must have covered the Temples, as certainly to
							countenance the suspicion that he was assassinated— All the remainder of
							the day, I was very busily engaged in writing and preparing for my
							departure.</p>

							and finishing the necessary preparations for my departure. My horses had

							prospect of foul weather, but it cleared away before I was without the
							bounds of the City, and the Evening was fine— The Road at the first
							three Stages from Stockholm, though generally good was hilly, and the
							Peasants complained that the Carriage was too heavy for four horses. I
							had already added a quarter of an hour to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Speyer’s allowance for every Stage between Stockholm and Oerebro— At
							Gran, the third Post house, I was already two hours in arrear of my
							time— I was to have arrived there at Midnight, but really reached the
							place only at 2 in the Morning.</p>

						<p><date>3. </date>As I alighted from my Carriage at Gran, I was accosted by
								<persRef ref="connell-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> and me. He gave me
							together with the Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, more
							than thirty Letters and dispatches, most of which had been forwarded by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— His Letter was to enclose

							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>, by which on a
							proposition from him, assented to by them the place of the proposed
							Negotiation is transferred from Gothenburg to Ghent in Flanders— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s Letter was dated 31 May, and
							mentioned his determination to proceed as yesterday by Land— The John
							Adams he observed was ready to receive us on board, and to sail; if we
							should choose to go on by Water— After a few minutes of deliberation,
							what was most advisable on this occasion for me to do, I determined to
							continue my Journey to Gothenburg— I sealed up again the Letter from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, with its enclosures, retaining
							the Duplicates of the Full-Powers to treat, which he had also
							transmitted— I had neither time, nor materials for writing to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, and verbally requested M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell to say to him, that I hoped he
							would use the utmost dispatch to join me at Gothenburg, or to give me
							notice if he should conclude to go on by Land— I was detained at Gran
							exactly one hour, and left it at three in the morning, taking with me,
							all the rest of the despatches and Letters delivered to me by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell— I was now three hours in arrear
							of my time, and continued so the remainder of the day— I travelled two
							whole Stages, to Lisslena, and Euköping while reading my Letters and
							Despatches.— I stopp’d another hour to Breakfast at Vesteräs; and
							arrived at Oerebro, at 11. in the Evening. From Gran, I had at every
							Stage, one or two hours of waiting money to pay to the Peasants who
							furnished the horses. The ordinances require them to wait four hours,
							from the time when the horses are ordered— For the first hour they are
							allowed Nothing; but for the three succeeding hours, they are entitled
							to 8 Schillings <pb n="111" type="ms"/>Banco, for each horse by the
							hour— The fare is from the Country-Post-houses 12 Schillings Banco per
							horse &amp; Swedish Mile— From the City Post-houses 16 Schillings, and
							from Stockholm 32. A Swedish Mile is 6 1/2 English Miles— Each Peasant
							furnishes two horses and goes with them himself— There is at each
							Post-house a Peasant, called the Hollkarl, whose duty it is to go for
							the horses, and it usually takes about two hours after they are ordered
							to procure them— Immediately after arriving at Oerebro, I sent on
								<persRef ref="gahlroos-axel">my Servant Axel</persRef>, with the
							Marche-Route or list of Stages for to-morrow, untill Kollangen where I
							calculated upon arriving at 11. to-morrow Evening.</p>

							hour before they came— Just as they arrived the Village Clock struck
							six, and the Post-master appealed to his Clock for proof of his
							punctuality. The succeeding three Stages, I rode exactly according to my
							Calculation— But at Boderne where I arrived between Noon and one O’Clock
							they assured me that the Road of that Stage was so mountainous and heavy
							with sand that four horses could not draw my Carriage— They had however
							no more than four in readiness for me, and with them I was obliged to
							depart. The horses themselves were unusually bad; and after proceeding
							with them about half a Swedish Mile which took me more than an hour, I
							found it absolutely impossible to get along with them, and was obliged
							to send back to the Post-house for two more horses— This detained me, an
							hour and a half longer; and even with the six horses, it was three full
							hours more before I reached the Stage at Hofva— Thus I was again three
							hours in arrear of my time— At Hasslerör the next Stage, they detained
							me two hours for horses, and obliged me to pay for the detention
							occasioned by themselves— Their Clocks now were half an hour in advance
							of the real time, as they had been half an hour behind it this Morning—
							I was obliged here again to take six horses, and to pay for three hours
							detention of the horses, the remainder of the road to Kollangen.</p>

								<persRef ref="gahlroos-axel">Axel</persRef> to bespeak the horses at

							only two Swedish Miles to my Journey I could come this Evening to
							Trolhätta, visit the curiosities of the place to-morrow Morning, have a
							Night’s repose for myself, and what was still more necessary for my

						<p><date>6. IV:30. </date>There was a Company of Ladies and Gentlemen here
							from Gothenburg, who had come to see the Waterfalls and Canal, and who
							had engaged the man, who usually shews them to Strangers— His name is
								<persRef ref="u">Strömbom</persRef>— We all went out in company
							together, at five of the Morning. We first saw the Canal, cut through
							and blown out of the solid rock— About two English Miles long 22 feet
							wide, and 8 feet deep— There are eight Locks forming a descent of 150
							feet. We saw several vessels coming from Lake Wener, descend through
							three or four of these Locks— Strömbom told us that if the Canal had
							been 36 feet wide, Vessels of a size suitable for navigating the Ocean
							might have descended by it— But that it was narrowed to 22 feet by the
							influence of the Gothenburg Merchants for the purpose of securing their
							own monopoly.— On visiting the waterfalls I immediately recognized them
							as the same that I had seen in January 1783. The Canal and Locks had not
							then been commenced, but were in contemplation; they were completed in
							the year 1800. About 9 O’Clock I returned to the Inn, and having
							breakfasted, proceeded upon my Journey.— From Forss to Kärra, and from
							Lahall, the last Stage, to Gothenburg, I took six horses. At both these
							places I overtook <persRef ref="gahlroos-axel">Axel</persRef>, whom I
							had sent forward this Morning to bespeak the horses, and I waited for
							them nearly an hour at every Stage. Wherever I had six horses there were
							three Peasants came with me to take them back. One of them at one of the
							Stages was a woman; and it is a very common thing at the Post-houses in
							Sweden— The women also row the Boats upon the Rivers, and in general
							perform almost every kind of labour which in other Countries exclusively
							belongs to the male sex— The Road from Trolhätta to Gothenburg is along
							the banks of the river called the Gotha-elf, and over a pleasant, though
							a hilly and rocky Country— On the Stage between Forss and Kärra I met
								<persRef ref="vonrosen-axel">Count Rosen</persRef> the Governor of
							Gothenburg who was going to Wenersborg— I arrived at Gothenburg between
							10 and 11. in the Evening, and <pb n="112" type="ms"/>took lodgings at
								<persRef ref="u">Sagerlind’s</persRef> inn— About half an hour after
							I arrived came a Soldier, and required me to go with him. He took me to
							a guard-house where there was a Lieutenant and two Subalterns, only one
							of whom spoke a very little bad French— He told me I must go with him to
							the Commandant, to be examined— The Commandant was in bed, and told the
							Lieutenant to take my Passport and bring it to him to-morrow Morning—
							Upon which the Lieutenant turned to me and said; Vous avez permission
							d’aller à votre quartier— It was about Midnight when I returned to my
							lodgings.</p>

							I had so often seen throughout the Province of Holland, that it seemed
							as if I was at home— It is the Season of the year when it appears to the
							greatest advantage— The meadows are clothed in their most beautiful
							verdure, and are covered with sheep and cattle— The Canals are lively
							with the constant passage to and fro of the treckschuyts and other
							boats, and the cleanliness of the houses and villages on the road is
							such as I had always seen in this Country— At the Helder there appears
							to be some encroachment upon the immemorial usages of the Land,
							particularly in the apparel of the women; but at Purmerend, and
							Schermerhorn and the other Villages on the road, the dress is <pb

							without stopping— The Road from Haerlem to the Hague is much improved
							since I was last here in 1797— I should have wished to stop a day or two
							at the Hague; but the first and most urgent duty was to repair as
							speedily as possible to the place of our destination.— I can scarcely
							account to myself for the Sensations which I felt on approaching the
							Hague, where I resided at several of the most interesting periods of my
							life— I saw it first at the age of thirteen years, in July 1780 when I
							came from Paris to Holland with <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-charles">my brother
								Charles</persRef>.— In 1783 on my first return from Russia, I lived
							with the family of <persRef ref="dumas-charles">C. W. F. Dumas</persRef>
							from April to the last of July— In 1784 from January to May, and again
							June and July— It was the precise time of my change from boy to man, and
							has left indelible impressions upon my Memory.— From November 1794 to
							October 1795 and from June 1796 to June 1797. I dwelt at the Hague on my
							first public Mission from the United States, and at that time commenced
							the regular Diary, which I have continued without interruption to this
							day. It was here that the social Passion first disclosed itself with all
							its impetuosity in my breast— It was here, that ten years later, I made
							my entrance on the political Theatre as a public man— It is not in my
							command of language to express what I felt on passing through the Yard
							of the House in the wood, and thence through the town, along the road
							between the Canal and Ryswick to Delft.— It was a confusion of
							Recollections so various, so tender, so melancholy, so delicious, so
							painful, a mixture so heterogeneous and yet altogether so sweet, that if
							I had been alone I am sure I should have melted into tears.— At four in
							the afternoon we came to the gate of Rotterdam; and without entering the
							City, dined there, and took fresh horses for Zwyndrecht— We crossed the
							Maes first about 3 English Miles below Rotterdam, and again from
							Zwyndrecht to Dortrecht— At Zwyndrecht we changed horses again to
							Prinsen Polder; and there having a favourable wind and tide made the
							water-Passage of about five English Miles to Lage-Zwahuw.— From
							Rotterdam this Road was entirely new to me. I had been twice between
							that place and Antwerp; but both times, by the Passage of the Moerdyke—
							It was about eleven at Night when we landed at Lage Zwaluw.</p>

						<p><date>23. IV. </date>We had ordered our horses at five this Morning, and
							I had agreed with <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> that we should start
							at six— We did so, and proceeded by the way of Breda to Antwerp. The

							of France; but the Country is in a state of interregnum—severed from
							France, and uncertain to whom it is to belong. Austria, France, Holland
							and even England all have pretensions, and the great anxiety of the
							People is to know who is to be their Master. We arrived at Antwerp, at 3
							O’Clock in the afternoon; and upon enquiry at the Post-house were told
							that the tide being low we could not cross the river with a Carriage
							untill to-morrow Morning.— We took lodgings for the Night at the Hotel
							of the Grand Laboureur. I went and delivered a letter of Introduction
							and Credit which <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Willink</persRef> had furnished me to a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dutari</persRef>— He made me offers of
							service; and excuses for not inviting me to his house, because he had
							fourteen English Soldiers quartered upon him— There is a small English
							Garrison of 3 or 4000 men now here, and more expected— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dutari has just returned from Paris— He
							thinks that this Country will belong to England, and will pay off part
							of the Austrian debt to purchase it— He says that the allies parted at
							Paris, in very ill humour with one another, and all of them excessively
							dissatisfied with Austria. That Austria is now levying new troops; and
							that he thinks the Congress at Vienna will not end well.— That they are
							daily expecting here the arrival of English Commissaries, to take
							possession of one third of the ships of the fleet, and one half of the
							materials of those upon the Stocks. That the English are sending troops,
							and taking possession of all the Sea-Ports on the Coast; and that the
							Hollanders will certainly be disappointed in their expectations of
							having this Country, annexed to them— In the Evening we went to the
							Theatre— Saw Les deux Ages, an Opera Comique— Arlequin Apprentif
							Magicien a Pantomime and Rope-dancing by <persRef
								ref="lalanne-marguerite">Madame Sacchi</persRef>— The plays were
							both very indifferent; and not well <pb n="117" type="ms"/>performed;
							but the Rope-dancing, was superior to any thing I had ever seen of that
							kind. But it was more painful than pleasing— A continual effort to do
							more than they could accomplish; frequent failures—several falls; and
							more than once with imminent danger of broken bones— The house was
							crowded, and half filled with English Officers. We sat in the Stage-box
							with a family of French Ladies and children before us. A Gentleman
							accosted me to remark that he supposed I was the father of those
							Children— I answered him that I was a stranger.— He said that he was
							himself the father of three Children; that he had married <persRef
								ref="u">Mademoiselle Storch</persRef>, the most beautiful young Lady
							of Antwerp, and that she was eighteen years old when they were married—
							He soon afterwards addressed the Ladies, and asked the mother who she
							was— The husband who afterwards came in amused himself with the
							appearance of the English Officers in the opposite boxes— Their round
							faces—their portly bellies—he said it was a pleasant thing to see such
							wholesome, full-fed bodies— That they prided themselves upon it— That
							the English thought it an excellent joke to laugh at the lanthorn jaws
							and spindle shanks of the frenchmen— And truly said he, they take
							special good care of their bodies— On voit que la partie animale est
							bien soignée.— The house was very warm; and I was so much fatigued as to
							be thoroughly weary before the Play finished.</p>

							day; and the day of our arrival at Ghent. We came down to the ferry
							about 9 in the Morning, and were obliged to wait there an hour and a
							half before we could cross it.— We saw several ships of the line on the
							river, with the white flag; and thirteen large ships on the Stocks;
							eight of the line, and five frigates, all of which are to be demolished;
							and half the materials to be delivered up to the English. At the Tete de
							Flandre, where we landed, there was a dispute between the Post-Master,
							and some collecting Officers, new comers, which of them should not
							receive our money for the Turnpikes— The Postmaster was at last obliged
							to receive it— We came through S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Nicolas
							and Lokeren, to Ghent, where we arrived at 4 in the afternoon, and took
							lodgings at the Hotel des Pays-Bas, on the Place d’Armes—the best Public
							House in the City.— I dined in my chamber alone, <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> having been the whole day quite unwell— Towards
							Evening I took a walk round the City, and wrote part of a Letter— At an
							early hour I retired for the Night.— The distance from Antwerp here is 6
							1/2 Posts; about 30 English Miles— The road a perfect level, and well
							paved— The Country a continual Garden— The fields of wheat, rye, barley
							and flax on both sides of the Road, left scarcely an interval between
							them— They appear now in their fullest beauty; some of them almost ready
							for the harvest. The others less advanced, but all waving above the
							ground, and in their fairest verdure— The road is bordered on both sides
							with large and shady trees— Elms— Lime Trees and Poplars, with a younger
							growth of Oaks, planted between the old Trees, and too near them to
							flourish— From their size they must have been planted shortly after this
							Country came into the possession of France— We saw likewise one or two
							Nurseries of Young Oaks.— But in general these trees, although they
							appeared to have been much cherished had not a healthy aspect— The soil
							does not seem to be favourable to their growth. When we alighted at the
							house the Landlady enquired if it was <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="milligan-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Milligan</persRef> had been here the day before yesterday, and after
							engaging Apartments for him, had gone upon a tour to Lille, from which
							he had not returned.— One of the singularities which we met with in this
							Country, and which as much as any thing indicates is Condition, is the
							multitude and diversity of the Coins in Circulation— The French Weights,
							Measures and Coins have been established by Law, and provisionally
							confirmed by the present temporary Government; but the People most
							commonly reckon according to the old Austrian Currency— In the short
							space of our Journey since Yesterday Morning we have received Coins of
								<persRef ref="mariatheresa">Maria Theresa</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="joseph-ii">Joseph 2</persRef>—<persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis
								Seize</persRef>, Roi des Francais, Union et Force 5 Franc Pieces,
							Bonaparte, premier Consul, <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Napoleon</persRef> Empereur—Republique Francaise—Italian Napoleon
							Lire, and finally Monnoie Obsidionale d’Anvers, copper Coins of 5 and 10
							Centimes, struck, during the late Siege of Antwerp— Dutch Florins and
							Stuivers also pass; but at a discount of ten or fifteen per Cent— We
							paid 1 1/2 franc per Post for each horse, and about the same for the
							Postilion.</p>

							Approbation of the Intendant.— 1. Upon the arrival of their Majesties
							the Bells and Chymes are to ring 2. The ringing and chyming is to be
							repeated several times throughout the day. 3. The Mayor, his adjoints,
							the municipal Conseil of the City, the five Confréries, and the Society
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Cecilia, are to go out and meet the
							two Monarchs— The Mayor is to Harangue them. 4. They are to enter at the
							Porte de Bruges, and to proceed through certain Streets and Squares to
							the Hotel of the Intendant— Unless their Majesties should order
							otherwise. 5. No Carriages are to <hi rend="italic">circulate</hi> in
							the parts of the City through which they will pass. 6. The Streets are
							to be strewed with flowers and green foliage— 7. At Eight O’Clock in the
							Evening is to commence a general Illumination 8. Copies of the Programme
							are to be sent to suitable persons— The Prussian troops of which there
							is here a Garrison of six or seven thousand men were under arms almost
							the whole day.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell and I sent a
							Message to the Mayor of the City to enquire when it would suit his

							afternoon about 4. with a Gentleman, I suppose his adjoint, both in full
							Costume with their official Sashes and paid me a visit— The Mayor made
							many obliging offers of service to the Mission, with the object of which
							he was acquainted, and particularly offered to provide us a place for
							holding the conferences if we should desire it— We dined at the Table
							d’Hote at one O’Clock. There were only eight or nine persons at table;
							among whom three or four Prussian Officers— <persRef
