						<p><date>1. V:15. </date>After writing to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and bringing up my
							journal to this day, I copied the Note Yesterday received from the
								<persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>. <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> brought me a copy
							of the paper referred to, in our Instructions, and which I had been
							yesterday unable to find. At 2 O’Clock we had the meeting of the
								<persRef ref="clay-henry;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>mission</persRef>, and further considered the Note yesterday
							received— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell were for replying that we would
							proceed no further unless the British Plenipotentiaries would explicitly
							agree to our proposed basis of a mutual restoration of territory taken
							during the war— It was however determined to give in reply a statement
							of all our points— A second question then arose whether the statement
							should be at large; in a Note; or in the formal draft of a Treaty— We
							finally concluded upon the latter; and the Articles drawn by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and myself were taken my M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell to be examined by him and
							successively by the other Gentlemen.— There was some further
							conversation upon the subject of the fisheries and Navigation of the
							Mississippi— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay renewed his objections
							against any Article, allowing the latter to the British— He made it a
							question whether we could agree to such an Article on the principle that
							since Louisiana had become a State, it was a part of her Sovereignty
							which the United States could not grant, and that in the Law of Congress
							authorizing Louisiana to form a Constitution, he had thought it
							necessary on the same principle to introduce a Section, reserving the
							right of the People of Kentucky to navigate the river— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin answered that the formation of
							Louisiana into a State, was subject to this privilege of the British,
							which had been stipulated in the Treaties of 1783 and 1794. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay replied, <pb n="164" type="ms"/>that
							if they had been released from it by the War, he saw no reason for
							renewing it upon them by Treaty now. He considered it as a privilege
							much too important to be conceded for the mere liberty of drying fish
							upon a desert. We were possessed of no facts to shew us the value of
							this—he did not know what it was worth: but the Mississippi was destined
							to form a most important part of the interests of the American Union.
							Every day was developing more and more its importance. The British could
							have no more right to the Navigation of it, than to that of any other
							river exclusively within our jurisdiction— Not so much as we have to
							navigate the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Laurence.— I have hitherto
							taken no part in this discussion and wish to postpone it as long as
							possible.— In the Evening I went to the Theatre and saw Une Folie and La
							Dot; both comic Opera’s—the music of the first by <persRef

								<persRef ref="dalayrac-nicolas">Dalayrac</persRef>. I sat in

							had the meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>mission</persRef> at eleven, and discussed all the Articles as
							drafted— Many alterations and amendments were agreed to. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, of all the members had alone been
							urgent to present an Article stipulating the abolition of the practice
							of impressment— I had proposed the Article offered by our Instructions
							of June 25. which is to refer the whole question to commissioners after
							the peace— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was so urgent to present
							previously an Article to settle the contest, that I acquiesced in which
							wishes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin were against proposing it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell declined voting until I declared
							myself with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay in favour of proposing
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s Article, and then M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell decided to propose it— But the
							great difficulty was with regard to the fisheries— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft proposed the renewal of
							the right of fishing and drying fish within the British Jurisdiction,
							together with the right of the British to navigate the Mississippi, both
							taken from the Peace of 1783— I was in favour of this— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay has an insuperable objection to the
							renewal of the right to the British of navigating the Mississippi— I
							then declared myself prepared either to propose M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s Article, or to take the ground that the whole
							right to the Fisheries was recognized as a part of our National
							Independence; that it could not be abrogated by the War, and needed no
							stipulation for its renewal. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							argued that on the same principle the British right to navigate the
							Mississippi would also be established without needing to be reviewed—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was averse to either of the
							courses proposed, and said that after all if the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, should insist upon this point, we
							should all finally sign the Treaty, without the provision respecting the
							fishery. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell expressed some doubt
							whether he would sign without it; and I explicitly declared that I would
							not; without further instructions— I could not say that would, with
							them.— We had not got through this discussion, when <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boswell</persRef> and another
							Gentleman came in, just arrived from London, and brought us a number of
							Dispatches, maps and volumes for which we had written to <persRef

								Beasley</persRef>— <persRef ref="bentzon-adrian">M<hi

							last Evening from London dined with us. In the Evening some of the
							Gentlemen attended the concert—others played whist in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s chamber, and I retired to mine, and
							wrote. Attempted then to walk on the place d’armes, but being overtaken
							with rain I went and passed the remainder of the Evening at <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith’s</persRef> chambers— He came in about nine, from the concert—

							We had the meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>mission</persRef>, between eleven and twelve o’clock, at my
							chamber— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay proposed a paragraph for
							the Note to be sent to the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, as a substitute instead of the Article
							respecting the fisheries, and the Navigation of the Mississippi, which
							had passed by vote on Saturday— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said
							that in declaring at that time that he should not sign the Note
							accompanying the projet, if it included M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin’s Article, he had not intended that it should in any manner
							affect the minds of any of us— If the Article should be proposed and
							accepted, and a Treaty otherwise not exceptionable should be obtainable,
							he might perhaps ultimately accede to it; but the object was in his view
							so important, that he could not reconcile it to himself to agree in
							making the proposal— I had drawn the sketch of an Article placing both
							the points precisely in their Condition at the commencement of the War;
							to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin objected that it
							offered the British more than his draft, because it entitled them to the
							provision in the Treaty of 1794— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							preferred it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft, because
							it would leave in all its force all the operation of our acquisition of
							Louisiana, as far as it impairs the British right of Navigating the
							Mississippi; but he still would not agree to it. His proposed paragraph
							took the ground which I had originally suggested, that all the fishery
							rights formed a part of the recognition of our Independence, and as such
							were by our Instructions excluded from discussion. I said I should have
							preferred the proposal of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							Article, as placing the subject out of controversy; but that as we could
							not be unanimous for that, I was willing to take M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Clay’s paragraph by which we should reserve all our rights
							and at the same time execute our Instructions.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin apprehended that the British Plenipotentiaries
							might on that point not reply to us at-all, and then if the Peace should
							be made without an Article renewing the fishing rights now contested by
							them, that the British Government would consider us as notified that the
							rights are at an end, and forcibly deprive our people of them— I was
							very confident that the British Plenipotentiaries would reply to us, and
							not leave the subject at this stage without further notice; and if they
							persevered in contending the rights were abrogated we might ultimately
							refuse to sign the Treaty on that ground— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Gallatin said his difficulty was that he thought the
							British had in this case the argument with them; and that the Treaty
							liberty of fishing and drying fish within their jurisdiction, was
							abrogated by the War— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that
							rather than differ among ourselves he would agree to substitute M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s paragraph instead of the proposed
							article, and this was ultimately assented to by us all— We then read
							over the Articles, as hitherto drawn up, and corrected and amended them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and myself are to prepare
							for to-morrow the observations on the several Articles, to be presented
							with the draft of the Treaty— After the meeting I took an hour’s walk—
								<persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todd</persRef>, returned last Evening from his excursion to Dunkirk
							and Lille, and this day made his appearance at dinner. In the Evening we
							went to the Subscription Concert— The first for the season— It was
							thinly attended—very few men excepting British and Hanoverian Officers—

						<p><date>10. VI:30. </date>A second day belated. On examining the drafts for
							the Note with the Amendments of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="bayard-james"
								>Bayard</persRef> &amp; <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Russell</persRef>, I found more than three fourths of what I had
							written erased— There was only one paragraph to which I attached
							importance, but that was struck out with the rest— It was the proposal
							to conclude the Peace on the footing of the State before the war,
							applied to all the subjects of dispute between the two Countries,
							leaving all the rest for future and pacific Negotiation. I abandoned
							every thing else that was objected to in my draft, but wrote over that
							paragraph again to propose its insertion in the Note. I had gone through
							my examination of the papers at breakfast time, and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> took them— At 11. O’Clock we had the meeting of
							the Mission. Every thing in the Note as amended was agreed to without
							difficulty, excepting my proposed paragraph— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay objected strongly against it; because we are forbidden
							by our Instructions from renewing the Article of the Treaty of 1794.
							allowing the British to trade with our Indians— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin who strenuously supported my proposition thought it
							did not necessarily include the renewal of that Article of the Treaty of
							1794. because it only offers the State before the War, with regard to
							the objects in dispute— The Indian trade never had been in dispute— He
							admitted however that if the British Government should accept the
							principle, and propose the renewal of the Treaties, we could not after
							this offer refuse it— I stated in candour that I considered my proposal
							as going that full length— That I was aware it would be a departure from
							our Instructions as prepared in April 1813.— But the Government for the
							purpose of obtaining Peace, had revoked our Instructions of that date,
							upon a point much more important in its estimation, the very object of
							the War, and I have no doubt would have revoked them on the other point
							had it occurred to them that they would prove an obstacle to the
							conclusion of Peace— I felt so sure that they would now gladly take the
							State before the War as the general basis of the Peace, that I was
							prepared to take on me the responsibility of trespassing upon their
							Instructions thus far— Not only so but I would at this moment cheerfully
							give my life, for a Peace on this basis— If Peace was possible it would
							be on no other— I had indeed no hope that the proposal would be
							accepted— But on the rupture it would make the strongest case possible
							in our favour; for the world both in Europe and America— It would put
							the continuance of the War entirely at the door of England, and force
							out her objects in continuing it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							then said, if the proposal was to be made at all, now was not the time
							for making it— If our projet should be rejected, and we should hereafter
							find Peace <pb n="167" type="ms"/>unattainable upon other terms we might
							offer it as a last resource; but that it was not proper at present— As
							to the Indians he had gone as far in concession upon that subject, as
							was possible—he would concede no more— And if we wanted Peace,
							Great-Britain wanted it quite as much— He saw no reason to believe that
							she would continue the War merely for the Indian trade— I said that it
							was for the British Government, and not for me to consider how far Peace
							might be necessary for them— I believed they were not sufficiently
							convinced of its necessity— If my proposal was to be made at all, now
							was precisely the best time for making it, because it would take off
							whatever there might appear to be of exorbitancy in our demands; and
							would not as it might hereafter have the appearance of shrinking from
							our own grounds— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin dwelt upon the
							same argument, and urged that several of our Articles very much needed
							some such softener— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard thought now
							the most favorable time for making the proposal, as the state of the War
							is now much more favorable to us, than we have reason to expect it will
							be in one or two Months— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell wavered.
							He asked how the proposal offered more than the projet itself— I told
							him that the projet offered all the knots of the Negotiation for
							solution now; and the proposal was to make Peace first, and leave them
							to be solved hereafter— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay finally said
							that he would agree to the insertion of my proposal in the Note; but
							reserving to himself the right of refusing to sign the Treaty, if the
							offer should be accepted and the principle extended beyond his
							approbation. The draft was then taken by <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> to be copied off fair, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell and myself
							remained to compare the residue of the Articles as they were prepared. A
							concluding Article, providing for the Ratifications and their exchange
							was prepared by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and me; after
							which I went out and walked about an hour— On returning home at four
							o’clock our Landlord <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Decobu</persRef> apologized for not having our dinner ready— He had
							thought we were all to dine at the <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean"
								>Intendant’s</persRef>; but it was the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">English
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> who dined there. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hughes was prepared with the Note, at his Rooms, at the back
							of our house— I took the Projet to him, and he copied on it the
							concluding Article— They were then brought back to our dining Room, and
							we signed the Note— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay still
							manifesting signs of Reluctance— He objected to the formal concluding
							Article, and thought it ridiculous— And he recurred again to the
							paragraph proposing the State before the War, as the general basis of
							the Treaty— He said the British Plenipotentiaries would laugh at us for
							it. They would say, aye aye—pretty fellows you; to think of getting out
							of the War, as well as you got into it!— I think it very probable this
							commentary will be made on our proposal— But what would be the
							commentary on our refusing Peace upon those terms?— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell dined with us, about 5 O’Clock,
							and immediately after dinner M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes took
							our Note and projet to the British Plenipotentiaries. I spent an hour of

							character of the war had made it absolutely necessary; and that the
							American Government from the nature of the propositions made in the

							was ended— We had at the time when that Note was sent to us been fully

							would recollect that his own impressions, and those of his colleagues
							had been the same— I had entertained then not the least expectation of
							being yet here on the first of September—but I hoped we were now much
							nearer to terms upon which we could agree. He said there was but one
							Article upon which he thought there would be difficulty; and that was
							the question as to the cession of territory. I told him, I hoped we
							should not hear a word more of that— He said they had received no reply
							from England to our last Note which they had immediately forwarded; but
							they expected a Messenger to-morrow— While we were at the Redoute, M<hi

							Within an hour after receiving these papers we had a meeting of the

								<persRef ref="peter2">Peter</persRef>, brought me this morning as
							the Clock struck six the British Note and Project, with M<hi

							excepting my own minutes, which were of no importance, to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>— As M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							understands the British Project there are still some things in it so
							objectionable that they ought on no consideration to be admitted. At
							eleven O’Clock <persRef ref="clay-henry;bayard-james">we</persRef> met
							and continued in Session until past four, when we adjourned to meet
							again at eleven to-morrow Morning.— Our principal discussion was an
							Article proposed by the British Government, as a substitute for the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of our project— And they have added a
							clause securing to them the Navigation of the Mississippi, and access to
							it with their Goods and Merchandize through our territories— To this
							part of the Article M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay positively
							objected; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed to agree to
							it, proposing an Article to secure our right of fishing and curing fish
							within the British Jurisdiction. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay
							lost his temper, as he generally does whenever this right of the British
							to navigate the Mississippi <hi rend="strikethrough">was</hi> is
							discussed. He was utterly averse to admitting it as an equivalent for a
							stipulation securing the contested part of the Fisheries— He said the
							more he heard of this the more convinced he was that it was of little or
							no value— He should be glad to get it if he could, but he was sure the
							British would not ultimately grant it— That the Navigation of the
							Mississippi on the other hand was an object of immense importance, and
							he could see no sort of reason for granting it as an equivalent for the
							fisheries— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin said that the
							fisheries were of great importance, in the sentiment of the Eastern
							Section of the Union— That if we should sign a peace without securing
							them to the full extent in which they were enjoyed before the War, and
							especially if we should abandon any part of the territory, it would give
							a handle to the party there now pushing for a separation from the Union,
							and for a New England confederacy to say that the interests of
							New-England were sacrificed, and to pretend that by a separate
							confederacy they could obtain what is refused to us. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay <pb n="171" type="ms"/>that there was
							no use in attempting to conciliate people who never would be
							conciliated. That it was too much the practice of our Government to
							sacrifice the interests of its best friends for those of its bitterest
							enemies— That there might be a party for Separation at some future day
							in the Western States too. I observed to him that he was now speaking
							under the impulse of passion; and that on such occasions I would wish
							not to answer any thing— That assuredly the Government would be
							reproached, and the greatest advantage would be taken by the party
							opposed to it, if any of the rights of the Eastern States should be
							sacrificed by the Peace— That the loss of any part of the fisheries
							would be a subject of triumph and exultation both to the enemy, and to
							those among us who had been opposed to the War— That if I should consent
							to give up even Moose Island, where there was a town which had been for
							many years regularly represented in the Legislature of the State of
							Massachusetts, I should be ashamed to shew my face among my Countrymen.
							That as to the British right of navigating the Mississippi, I considered
							it as nothing, considered as a grant from us— It was secured to them by
							the Peace of 1783. they had enjoyed it at the commencement of the War;
							it had never been injurious in the slightest degree to our own People,
							and it appeared to me that the British claim to it was just and
							equitable— The boundary fixed by the Peace of 1783, was a line due west
							from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi, and the Navigation of the
							river was stipulated for both Nations. It has been since that time
							discovered that a line due west from the Lake of the Woods will not
							touch the Mississippi, but goes North of it— The boundary therefore is
							annulled by the fact— Two things were contemplated by both parties in
							that compact—one that the line should run west from the Lake of the
							Woods; the other that it should touch the Mississippi— In attempting now
							to supply the defect, we ask for the line due west, and the British ask
							for the shortest line to the Mississippi— Both demands stand upon the
							same grounds— The intention of both parties at the Peace of 1783. If we
							grant the British demand, they touch the river and have a clear right to
							its Navigation— If they grant our demand, they do not touch the river,
							but in conceding the territory they have a fair and substantial motive
							for reserving the right of navigating the river— I was not aware of any
							solid answer to this argument— I believed the right to this navigation,
							a very useless thing to the British, especially after they have
							abandoned all pretence to any territorial possessions upon the river—
							But the National pride, and honour were interested in it— The Government
							could not make a peace which would abandon it— They had the same reasons
							for insisting upon it that we had for insisting on the fisheries and the
							entire restoration of territory.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							said that by the British Article now proposed they demanded not only the
							navigation of the river, but access to it through our territories
							generally, from any part of their dominions, and by any road— And
							without any guard even for the collection of our duties— That this might
							be an advantage to the People of Kentucky; for it was the shortest way
							to them for all imported merchandize— Goods could in that manner be sent
							by the S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Lawrence river, from Europe to
							his house, with a land carriage of not more than fourteen miles— But it
							would give the British access to our Country in a dangerous and
							pernicious manner— It would give them the trade with the Indians in its
							full extent, and enable them to use all the influence over those
							Savages, which had already done us so much harm. I observed that with
							regard to the trade with the Indians, I had no doubt the British
							Government meant and understood that to be already conceded, in the
							Article to which we had agreed— That I understood it so myself— That by
							restoring to the Indians all the rights they had in 1811. we had
							restored to them the right of trading with the British, and of having
							the British traders go among them for the purposes of trade— That if
							there could at any time have been a doubt that such would be its
							operation, the explanatory Article after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jay’s treaty, and the Greenville Indian Treaty would remove it— How
							could we possibly be said to restore to the Indians the right of trade,
							if we debarred those who carried it on from trading with them?— As to
							the duties, undoubtedly provision must be made for collecting them; and
							no doubt that would be agreed to. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin declared himself of the same opinion with me that the grant of
							the mere right of the Navigation of the Mississippi; but he asked me why
							I had then hesitated so much about offering it as an equivalent for the
							fisheries? M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay on the other hand thought
							there would be a gross inconsistency in asking a specific stipulation
							for the fisheries, after the ground we had taken that no Article was
							necessary to secure us in the enjoyment of them. I said that my
							reluctance <pb n="172" type="ms"/>at granting the Navigation of the
							Mississippi arose merely from the extreme interest that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and the Western people attached to
							it— That as to the ground we had taken upon the fisheries, I believed it
							firm and solid— I had put my name to it, and considered myself as
							responsible for it— But when some of my own Colleagues who had also put
							their names to it, told me in this chamber among ourselves that they
							thought the ground untenable, and that there was nothing in our
							principle, I found it necessary to mistrust my own judgment—particularly
							as the enemy after having given us notice that they meant to deprive us
							of the fisheries in part, unless a new stipulation should secure them.
							If our principle was good for the fisheries, on our part, it was good to
							the British for the Navigation of the Mississippi— The <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>Plenipotentiaries</persRef> had made no reply to our remarks
							concerning the fisheries— That silence might be taken for acquiescence,
							and if there was nothing more I would rest it upon that— But they asked
							for a new stipulation of their right to navigate the Mississippi— This
							implied their opinion that they had lost the right as agreed to in the
							Treaty of 1783— It became necessary therefore for us to ask a similar
							stipulation for the fisheries within their jurisdiction; but I would not
							accept it even for the rights of fishing on the Banks. I would not sign
							a Treaty containing such a Stipulation—for it would be a sort of
							admission that the right would be liable to forfeiture by every War we
							might have with Great-Britain— I would not take therefore a stipulation
							for any thing recognized in the Treaty of Peace as a right— No more,
							(said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin) than an Article
							acknowledging again our Independence— I said, certainly. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard thought there was a material
							difference between the rights secured by the Peace of 1783 to us, and
							the British right of navigating the Mississippi in the same Treaty— The
							rights recognized as belonging to us were certainly permanent, and not
							to be forfeited by a subsequent War— But we had nothing to grant— We
							recognized no new rights to the British— The Mississippi was not then
							ours to grant. It was held by Spain; and the aspect of the subject was
							entirely changed by our subsequent acquisition of Louisiana— Our
							argument for the fisheries might therefore be sound and yet not apply to
							the British for the Navigation of the Mississippi— It became necessary
							to determine by a vote whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s
							proposal to offer an Article, making the Navigation an equivalent for
							the fisheries should be adopted; and it was determined that it should.
							At the meeting to-morrow he is to produce it, and the draft of a Note to
							the British Plenipotentiaries— While we were in Session we received a
							Note from them a Note; with Passports for the Herald, and for <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson;smith-caroline">his family</persRef> to
							go by the Neptune, as they had been requested in our late applications—
							In the Evening I went to the Theatre, and saw the Travellers benighted,
							or the bleeding Nun, with Of Age to-morrow, performed by the English
							Company of Players— After I came home, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin brought me a letter respecting the loan, brought by an American

							brought us all to unison again by a joke— He said he perceived that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams cared nothing at all about the
							Navigation of the Mississippi, and thought of nothing but the fisheries—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay cared nothing at-all about the
							fisheries, and thought of nothing but the Mississippi— The East was
							perfectly willing to sacrifice the West; and the West was equally ready
							to sacrifice the East— Now he was a western man, and would give the
							Navigation of the river for the fisheries— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell was an Eastern Man, and was ready to do the same— I
							then told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I would make a
							Coalition with him of the East and West. If the British would not give
							us the fisheries I would join him in refusing to grant them the
							Navigation of the river.— He said that the consequence of our making the
							offer would be that we should lose both— Upon the rest of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft there was no difference
							of opinion and little discussion— It was admitted that if the Navigation
							of the river was granted, and access to it through our territories,
							provision must be made for collecting the duties, and their access must
							be limited to particular points of departure and a mere road— Or if
							general access like that which they demand should be granted, they ought
							to grant in return to our People access through their territories to the
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Lawrence, and the Navigation of that
							river.— I then suggested that I wished to make an addition of one or two
							more paragraphs to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft of a
							Note, the object of which would be to shew our sense of the importance
							of the concessions we had made, and intimating our determination to make
							no cession of territory, and to sacrifice none of the Rights or
							Liberties which we enjoyed at the commencement of the War— There was an
							adjournment from two to three O’Clock, for me to make the draft of the
							additional paragraphs that I proposed— I had them ready at the adjourned
							meeting— They were read and discussed until past four, our dinner time—
							It was finally concluded to meet again to-morrow Morning at eleven; and
							in the mean time that all my Colleagues, should successively revise my
							draft.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Strong</persRef>, the person who
							brought us a letter last Night from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, dined with us— The English company of players, sent a petition
							to us to permit them to perform to-morrow Evening under our <hi
								rend="italic">patronage</hi>, and to command the play— We agreed to
							take several boxes, but not to be advertised as their patrons— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay had some sparring about it while we were at dinner; which passed
							off by their drinking a glass of wine together— I passed the Evening
							partly in my chamber, writing, and the rest at <persRef

								Smith’s</persRef> where I found <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi

						<p><date>30. V:30. </date>I have insensibly run several days in arrears with
							this Journal; at a time, when it has become important to keep close to
							the current of time— I began therefore this morning to retrieve it. But
							at eleven O’Clock came again the time for the Meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef> which was in my Chamber— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin had very much shortened and very materially altered
							my paragraphs. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had brought a draft
							of his own.— My draft as originally written, and as amended; and his
							were all read. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was for omitting
							the whole— I objected to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s as having
							altogether departed from what I had wished to say— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s amendments had very much
							altered the character of my draft, but I acquiesced in them; and it was
							concluded to admit them, and adopt my draft thus amended as part of the
							Note— In waving our claims of Indemnities for losses subsequent to the
							War, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thought there was one
							description of them for which another effort ought to be made.— It was
							for vessels and property which were in English Ports on the commencement
							of the War; and were seized without allowing them the usual six Months
							to depart— We had allowed the six Months, for English Vessels and
							property in our Ports at the time of the declaration, and it was agreed
							to send the <persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef> a copy of that part of the
							Statute, and ask a discussion of the subject.— I proposed also to send
							them a copy of the deposition we have respecting the sale, by their
							Officers in the West-Indies of Negroes seduced from their Masters in our
							Southern States; by promises of liberty— The part of our Instructions
							which asserts this fact has been noticed in both houses of Parliament in
							England— The Ministers have pledged themselves to make strict enquiry
							into it, and I thought the communication of the proof furnished us by
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> might be
							useful, as it would certainly become thereby public, and by drawing the
							public attention to the practice might prevent its repetition hereafter.
							It would probably cease when the officers should no longer have the
							motive for stealing the negroes, in the opportunity to sell them— But
							all my Colleagues objected against sending this paper. They said its
							tendency would only be to irritate, when we should make our note as
							conciliatory as possible— That the proof was weak; being only a single
							deposition— That the charge as made in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s instructions to us had more weight without this proof than it
							would have with it. I replied that the fact was stated to be of public
							notoriety— That the deposition which we have is circumstantial upon one
							particular instance, with names and dates, and that it testifies also to
							the general practice. That no proof could be stronger; so far as one
							witness could afford proof— It was however determined not to send it— We
							adjourned from one <pb n="174" type="ms"/>O’Clock, until three, while
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> prepared the Note thus agreed to— I took in the
							interval a walk round the Ramparts— At three, we had a second meeting,
							and signed the Note, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes
							immediately took to the British Plenipotentiaries— We dined, and spent
							the Evening at Cards, at <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Meulemeester’s</persRef>— I played
							with the handsome <persRef ref="meulemeester-therese">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Meulemeester</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Van Aken</persRef>; and a
							French Gentleman; a Stranger, late from Paris— Some of the Gentlemen
							went to the Theatre, and returned— As we came home, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin told me that an answer had been
							received from the British Plenipotentiaries appointing to-morrow, noon
							for the Conference, at the Chartreux, their own house.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I rise usually between 5 and 6.
