							O’Clock the municipal procession, passed by our house— I immediately
							went out and followed them with the crowd— They marched to the Hotel de
							Ville, and proceeded to the Hall where the distribution of the prizes
							was to be made. I found a seat on one of the benches— The intendant of
							the department; the <persRef ref="philippedelens">Mayor</persRef>, and
							the municipal Council soon after entered, and took seats upon a Stage
							erected at one end of the Hall— The mayor read a speech from a printed
							pamphlet— He announced the occasion of this distribution of prizes to be
							the exertions of the adjoint Mayor, <persRef ref="verhaaggen-goesin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Verhaaggen</persRef>, of the
							Commanders of the City Foot and Horse Guards, of the five fraternities
							and of the Society of <persRef ref="stcecilia">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t</hi> Cecilia</persRef>, for the preservation of tranquility
							and the protection of property, on the late change, after the French
							Authorities had disappered, and before others had taken their place. The
							deputy mayor had a large silver medallion, and a smaller gold one— The
							commander of the City foot guard a Sword— The Commander of the
							horse-guard a Sabre— The five Fraternities, each a silver medal— The
							Society of St Cecilia the same and also a Staadrof Colours richly
							embroidered— The <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean"
								>intendant</persRef> and the Mayor distributed the prizes— The
							Commander of the Horse-Guard, on receiving the Sabre made a Speech, and
							said if any future danger should <pb n="127" type="ms"/>arise, it should
							be used for the defence of the City. An Officer in uniform, one of the
							Members of the Society of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Cecilia, sung
							an hymn à la Reconnoissance, written and composed for the occasion, and
							of which printed copies were circulated, as well as of the Mayor’s
							Speech— This Ceremony lasted about an hour; and when it was over I
							returned home— At 3 in the afternoon there was another at the same place
							to which <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan;gallatin-albert;clay-henry;bayard-james"
								>we</persRef> were all invited. To this we went in Company with the
							Intendant and Mayor, and were seated next to them on the Stage— The
							Mayor, the President of the Academy of fine Arts, a lawyer named
								<persRef ref="u">Hellebaut</persRef>, and the Intendant, read
							Speeches; after which the Victors were proclaimed and the prizes given,
							for the best works of painting, drawing and Architecture, exposed at the
							Saloon— We were requested to take a part in the distribution of the
							prizes, and each of us delivered one of them to one of the successful
							Candidates— There was a flourish of horns and Clarions, every time that
							a prize was given— The Pupil who had obtained the first prize of
							Architecture read a Speech to return thanks in the name of the Victors—
							When these ceremonies were finished we passed into another Hall, and
							were requested each of us to return home with one of the pupils who had
							obtained a prize— I went in company with one of the Directors of the
							Academy, and a lad about 15 years named <unclear><persRef ref="u"
								>Zaligo</persRef></unclear>— The streets in the neighborhood of where the
							victors lived were hung with ever-greens and flowers in bloom. In the
							Evening they were illuminated. The <persRef ref="u">father</persRef> of
							the Youth with whom I went is a goldsmith, and apparently very poor. He
							and the <persRef ref="u">mother</persRef> appeared however to be much
							delighted with the success of their Son— The boy presented to the
							Gentleman who took him home a Letter, requesting his friendly assistance
							to get him and his father a place as Clerk in some public office, or for
							himself in some counting-house.— The gentleman gave it to me, but I
							could not obtain what the lad wanted— It was six in the Evening before
							we reached home to dinner; and Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							came and serenaded us at our door, while we were at dinner— We invited
							them in, but they declined. At 10 in the Evening we went to the Ball,
							given by the President and Directors of the Society of the Fine Arts—
							The Hall where they were assembled was small and much crowded with
							company— I knew scarcely a person there— Came home before Midnight.</p>

							morning at a Sitting of the Cour d’Assise, or Criminal Tribunal— We had
							seats assigned to us, and the President of the Tribunal addressed us in
							a short complimentary Speech—which on the motion of the accusateur
							Public, or Attorney General, was ordered to be entered on the records of
							the Court.— There were besides the President, four Judges on the Bench—
							Their dress was a black gown over which the President had a scarlet
							surplice— There were present only two lawyers, the public accuser, and
							the Prisoners Counsel or Defenseur officieux— The Jury appeared to
							consist altogether of Gentlemen— <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Meulemeester</persRef> was one of
							them. The trial was of a man charged with having written three
							incendiary letters, to extort money. The letters were produced, and
							French Translations of them were read— The witnesses were then heard,
							but only one by one; they were all sent out of Court and then called in
							successively. The proceedings were in French, but the Witnesses and the
							Prisoner spoke altogether in Flemish. There was interpreter who
							translated what was said by them and by the President. There was a
							continual interrogatory of the Prisoner, who was always called upon to
							say what he had to answer to the testimony of each <pb n="128" type="ms"
							/>witness, after it was delivered— The leaning of the Court, or rather
							of the President was very hard against the prisoner. And his answers
							before the Judge who committed him, were continually referred to as
							contradictory to those he gave now. His Counsel once ventured to object
							that the Court was asking leading questions, but he was instantly
							silenced by the President, who declared he had a right, and that it was
							his duty to use every means to discover the truth, and advised the
							Council to keep within his own bounds— At one time two of the other
							judges were speaking together and the president turned to them and said
							taisez vous Messieurs— C’est à dire, s’il vous plait— The attorney
							General observed that many of the words in the incendiary letters were
							misspelt, and in a very extraordinary way. He proposed that the Clerk
							should dictate to the prisoner to write the same words, and that the
							spelling in the two papers might be compared together which was done—
							The Court adjourned between one and two O’Clock, untill 1/2 past 3. to
							hear the remaining witnesses—and to morrow the cause is to be argued by
							the Counsel.— At home I wrote untill dinner time; and in the Evening
							walked two hours out from one of the City Gates— Received two Letters

							to-morrow at 1. O’Clock afternoon at their lodgings, and exchange our
							full-powers, and arrange the mode of proceeding between us for the
							future— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard received this

							promised that we would send an answer this Evening.— <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">We</persRef> had a meeting at Noon, and were

								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> should call in the Evening on M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker, and say that we should be happy to

								>r</hi> Bayard produced the case in <persRef ref="ward-robert"
								>Ward’s</persRef> History of the Law of Nations Vol. 2. chap. 16. of
							the Commissioners, between Spain and England, at Boulogne in 1600. which
							in almost every particular resembles the present, and at which the

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> were reluctant at taking any notice of this

							to clog the Negotiation with any question of mere ceremony.— We
							adjourned the meeting again to dine, and finally concluded to send M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes with the message I had proposed,
							substituting at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s suggestion,
							instead of the expressions “at any place other than their own

							upon”; and authorising M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes to name the

							Clay’s chamber, that the British Commissioners agreed to meet us at the

							having yet returned from Dunkirk— After the first ordinary civilities
							had passed, we produced on both sides, the Originals, and Copies of our

							respectively, were exchanged— Lord Gambier then addressed us, with
							Assurances on the part of the British Government of their sincere and
							earnest desire that this Negotiation might terminate in a successful
							issue; and the ardent hope of the British Commissioners that we might
							all have the satisfaction of restoring the blessings of Peace to our
							respective Countries— This I answered by making similar assurances on
							our part; expressing the high satisfaction with which we received
							theirs, and the promise for myself and my Colleagues to bring to these
							discussions the disposition to meet every sentiment of candour and
							conciliation with the most cordial reciprocity—concurring as we did with
							the utmost earnestness and sincerity in the hope that we might
							eventually have the happiness of reconciling two Nations, whose true
							interests could best be promoted by Peace and Amity with each other—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Goulburn the second British
							Commissioner then replied. He renewed the professions of the sincere
							desire of the British Government for Peace, and added the most explicit
							declaration that nothing that had occurred since the first proposal for
							this Negotiation, would have the slightest effect on the disposition of
							Great-Britain with regards to the terms upon which the pacification
							might be concluded. He proceeded to say that the British Government
							thought it would be most conducive to this end to discard all
							retrospective Considerations with regard to any thing that had taken
							place, and had instructed them in <pb n="130" type="ms"/>in relation to
							certain points, which they supposed would naturally arise for discussion
							upon this Negotiation. These points he was charged by his Colleagues to
							state; with request to be informed whether they were such as by our
							Instructions we were authorized to discuss, and that we would also on
							our part any other points, upon which we also might be instructed to
							propose for discussion— Those which he was directed to present, were 1.
							The forcible seizure of Mariners, on Board of American Merchant Vessels,
							and connected with that subject the claim of the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king of Great-Britain</persRef> to the native born
							Allegiance of all the native born Subjects of Great-Britain. 2. The
							including of the Indian Allies of Great-Britain; and for the purpose of
							obtaining a permanent pacification the drawing of a boundary line for
							the Indians. and it was necessary to observe that on both parts of this
							point, Great-Britain considered them as a sine qua non to the conclusion
							of a Treaty— 3. The partial Revision of the Boundary Line between the
							United States and the British Possessions in North America—upon which on
							a question asked by <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bayard</persRef>, he explained that in such revision
							Great-Britain did not contemplate an acquisition of Territory.— He then
							said that besides these three points it was thought proper in candour to
							state that in relation to the fisheries, although it was not intended to
							contest the right of the United States to them, yet so for as respected
							the concession to land and dry fish within the exclusive Jurisdiction of
							the British it was proposed not to renew that without an equivalent. I
							said that I would confer with my Colleagues, and at our next Meeting
							would report our answer upon the Points proposed by them; which I
							recapitulated; and also the statement of such further points as we
							should present for discussion. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn
							urged an immediate answer upon the question whether we were instructed,
							particularly upon the point which they were directed to make a sine qua
							non; but I declined answering on any point without first consulting with
							my Colleagues.— We agreed to meet again to-morrow at 11 O’Clock— I
							mentioned the offer made to us by the <persRef ref="philippedelens"
								>Mayor</persRef>, and afterwards repeated by the <persRef
								ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Intendant</persRef>, immediately after
							our first arrival here— They are now both absent, at Bruxelles. It was
							preferred however, both by the British Commissioners and ourselves, to
							have the Meetings alternately at our own houses; and, Lord Gambier said
							that as they were not now very well accommodated; if it was agreeable to
							us the meeting to-morrow should be at our house; to which we readily
							agreed— We then returned home, and about an hour afterwards, we went and
							paid them a visit at their Lodgings— On returning from thence we met to

						<p><date>9. VI. </date>We had agreed upon a meeting of the Mission at half
							past 9 O’Clock this morning, and we actually met in <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bayard’s</persRef> chamber at ten— We agreed upon the answer to be
							made on the points, presented for discussion by the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james">British Commissioners</persRef>; and on those to
							be presented by us— The British Commissioners came at eleven— And in the
							name of the Mission, I stated, that we were instructed upon the first
							and third points presented by them, and that on the second and fourth
							points we were not.— I then proceeded to state the points proposed on
							our part. 1. A Definition of Blockade, and as far as may be mutually
							agreed, of other neutral and Belligerent Rights. 2. Certain claims of
							indemnity to individuals for captures and seizures preceding and
							subsequent to the War. 3. I added that we were instructed upon a variety
							of other Points, which might with propriety be subjects for discussion
							either upon a Negotiation for Peace, or upon that of a Treaty of
							Commerce, which in the Event of a propitious termination of this
							Negotiation we were also authorised to conclude— That in order to
							simplify and facilitate as much as possible the great object of Peace we
							had discarded every point, which did not more peculiarly belong to that,
							and were not immediately relevant to it— They replied that their Powers
							extended only to the <pb n="131" type="ms"/>conclusion of a Peace, but
							that they did not mean to say, or wish us to understand that there would
							be any objection on the part of Great-Britain to treating upon
							commercial objects in the Event of a successful issue to this
							Negotiation— I said that it readily accounted for our not being
							instructed on the two Points of the Indian Boundary and the Fisheries,
							that they had not been objects of controversy between the two
							Governments heretofore— That they were points entirely new, and that it
							was a matter of course that our Instructions should be confined to the
							subjects of difference in which the War originated, and to the topics of
							discussion, known by the American Government to exist. It was further
							remarked by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> that the American Government could have anticipated
							no propositions of this Nature from the Letter of <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> proposing the
							Negotiation; to which <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn</persRef> replied, that it
							could not be expected Lord Castlereagh would in the proposal for the
							Negotiation enumerate the points which would become subjects of
							discussion in the course of it; as they would naturally depend upon
							Events occurring after the proposal, and untill the commencement of the
							Negotiation. I said it was our wish to receive from the British
							Commissioners the views of their Government upon all the points, and
							that we were willing to discuss them all. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn asked whether if they should enter into the discussion we could
							give them an expectation that it would terminate in our agreeing to a
							provisional Article, which we would sign subject to the ratification of
							our Government— I answered that having no specific Instructions upon the
							Subject, whatever Article we could agree to must of course be
							unauthorised, and we could not say previous to discussion whether an
							article could be formed to which we should feel ourselves under our
							discretionary Powers justified in acceding—this related especially to
							the point of the Indian Boundary—the British Sine qua non— <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> said that so far as respected the including of
							the Indians in the Peace, the United States would have neither interest
							nor wish to continue the War with the Indians when that with
							Great-Britain should be terminated— That Commissioners had already been
							appointed to treat of Peace with the Indians, and very probably the
							Peace might already be made— He said that the Policy of the United
							States towards the Indians, was the most liberal of that pursued by any
							Nation; that our Laws interdicted the purchase of Lands from them by any
							individuals and that every precaution was used to prevent the frauds
							upon them which had heretofore been practised by others— He stated that
							this proposition to give them a distinct boundary, different from the
							boundary already existing, and by a Treaty between the U. States and
							Great-Britain was not only new, it was unexampled. No such Treaty had
							been made by Great-Britain, either before or since the American
							Revolution; and no such Treaty, had to his knowledge ever been made by
							any other European Power— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said
							that they were certainly treated as in some respects Sovereigns, since
							Treaties were made with them both by Great-Britain and the United
							States.— Treaties with them, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							admitted; but Treaties between European Powers, defining their
							boundaries, there were to his knowledge none— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard asked what was understood by Great-Britain to be the
							effect and operation of the boundary line proposed— Was it to restrict
							the United States, from making Treaties with them hereafter, as
							heretofore? from purchasing their Lands for instance? was it to restrict
							the Indians from selling their Lands? Was it to alter the Condition of
							the Indians such as it has hitherto existed— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goulburn answered, that it was intended as a Barrier between
							the British Possessions and the Territories of the United States— That
							it was not to restrict the Indians from selling their Lands, although it
							would restrict the United States from purchasing them. <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef>,
							said that both G. Britain and the United States would be restricted from
							purchasing the Lands, but the Indians would not be restricted from
							selling them to a third party. As to further discussion upon the point
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said that however desirous they
							were of getting over the difficulty, they thought it would be an
							unprofitable discussion, unless they could see some result to which it
							was likely to lead— They proposed to adjourn for an hour to give us time
							to consult together, whether we could say that we might eventually agree
							to a provisional Article; but we were not desirous of such consultation—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that the difficulty
							which <pb n="132" type="ms"/>we had suggested was stated merely on a
							principle of candour; that it would have been easy for us to have said
							at once that there might be an article formed on the subject to which we
							might agree, and afterwards to break off upon the details of any such
							Article; but that the proceeding was more frank and explicit to avow at
							once the full extent of our objection. The British Commissioners then
							proposed to suspend the Conferences, untill they could consult their
							Government on this state of things. They proposed to send off a
							Messenger this Evening.— And it was proposed by them that a Protocol of
							the two meetings, should be drawn up by the two Secretaries separately,
							and that we should meet and compare them together and make a final
							record from the two, of the proceedings on these days— To this we
							agreed— As they went away, I told Lord Gambier that I hoped in their
							communication to their Government, they would express how much we had
							been gratified at the candid and conciliatory manner which the British
							Commissioners had adopted with us— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							added that upon this subject they could not express themselves in too
							strongly— They answered that they should be altogether deficient in
							their duty, if they omitted to express their sentiments in these
							respects— They agreed to meet again at our house to-morrow, at 12.
							O’Clock Noon— I was immediately charged by my Colleagues to make the
							rough draft of the Protocol, for <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef>— I drew it up
							accordingly. It was corrected by Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Bayard, Gallatin and Clay; and given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hughes, to make out a fair copy of it for to-morrow-morning.— I wrote to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and walked
							an hour and a half in the Evening— <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi

						<p><date>10. V:30. </date>At twelve O’Clock we met the British
							Commissioners, and compared the two Reports which had been drawn up, on
							their part and on ours, to make the Protocol of the two former
							Conferences— There was no material difference between the two on the
							proceedings of the first day— But the British Commissioners objected to
							various parts of our report of those of the second day—particularly to
							those parts which stated the explanation they had given of the point
							respecting the proposed Indian Boundary, and to the reasons assigned by
							us, why our Government had not provided us with Instructions, on that
							point, and the one concerning the Fisheries. Their objection was that
							these things were argumentative, and that the Protocol should contain a
							mere statement of facts. <persRef ref="adams-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef> observed that if it
							contained our Reasons, for the omission of the two Points from our
							Instructions, it should also contain their Reasons for supposing that
							our Instructions might have provided for them. I admitted this, if in
							fact any such Reasons had been assigned by them—but they had not.
								<persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goulburn</persRef> stated that he thought this assignment of
							reasons, and the explanatory paragraphs, were more proper to be inserted
							in a dispatch to our Government than upon the Protocol, which is a mere
							record of facts. He said if matter of argument were admitted on one side
							it must also be admitted on the other and must eventually contain every
							thing said at the Conferences, which if we should have many would swell
							it up to an excessive Volume— We replied that the explanatory paragraphs
							were material to unfold the full import of their proposals— <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							put it pointedly to them that they had not disclosed their full meaning.
							He said their proposition respecting the Indian Boundary as put by
							themselves, was not intelligible to us— Did they mean to take a portion
							of our Territory, and assign it to the Indians? did they mean in a word
							to alter the Condition of the Indians, in relation to the United
							States?— The British Commissioners manifested here a slight movement
							impatience at these questions, and of regret at having answered so
							explicitly those that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had put to
							them yesterday— They said they could not be expected to develope at this
							stage of the business if at any, the ultimate views and intentions of
							their Government in this proposal. But they assented to an alteration in
							their own statement of the point. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams
							said that it could not be said there was a Territory <hi rend="italic"
								>assigned</hi> to People, which was already in their Possession.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn used the words Dominions,
							and Territories of the Indians— I remarked to them that they must be
							aware the Terms Dominions, Territories, and Possessions as applied to
							Indians were of very different import, from the same terms as applied to
							civilized Nations— That this difference was well known and understood,
							and in the same manner hitherto by all the European Nations— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said it was however necessary to
							use one or the other of those words, and finally preferred that of
							Territory.— Our draught had stated that the British Commissioners had
								<hi rend="italic">declined</hi> entering further into the
							discussion, <pb n="133" type="ms"/>unless they would say that an Article
							might be drawn up on this point, to which we might accede provisionally
							and subject to the Ratification of our Government, and that they had
							proposed to suspend the Conferences, untill they could consult their
							Government on this state of things— They objected also to the insertion
							of this upon the Protocol. We urged that this was not only a fact; but a
							fact so material to the Statement of what had actually taken place, that
							without it, the Protocol itself must be imperfect. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said he thought it was expressed
							rather too strongly to say, that they had <hi rend="italic"
								>declined</hi>, entering into the discussion— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							reminded him of the express words used by himself, which he admitted,
							but said those were remarks which he had thrown out rather in the manner
							of friendly discussion, than intimating a fixed purpose to decline it in
							future. We readily agreed to omit the expression that they had <hi
								rend="italic">declined</hi> further discussion, but pressed them on
							the fact of their having suspended the Conferences, to send a Messenger
							to their Government— They said they had mentioned their intention to us,
							only from the perfect candour of their proceedings, and perhaps
							over-hastily— That if we should insist upon putting it on the Protocol,
							the only effect of it would be to seal up their lips hereafter; and put
							them upon a reserve which they should be unwilling to assume.— <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> repeated the remark that the omission would leave
							the Protocol imperfect; as it would appear from it that our request for
							further discussion had not been answered, when in fact it had— They
							thought there was no necessity that the answer should appear; but that
							it might stand with the expression of the wish, and its result to be
							seen hereafter— As we could not prevail upon them to express any thing
							upon the Record, but what suited them, we finally agreed to omit every
							thing to which they objected— We then left <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> and <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, to make out from the
							two draughts, the Protocol, to be the common Record of both parties.—
							Immediately after the Conference, (at which <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> was present) we had a meeting of the Mission, at
							which I was charged to prepare the draught of a despatch to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>. This task I
							referred to the Morning and was employed during all the leisure of this
							day, in making the minutes in this Journal of our proceedings on the two
							former days— Shortly after the Conference we had a visit from the
							British Commissioners.— <persRef ref="gambier-james">Lord
								Gambier</persRef> introduced to us his nephew, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gambier</persRef>— After dinner we had

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Russell</persRef> a very

							They have just arrived from Paris— I was thus detained untill after

								<persRef ref="carroll-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef>, walking with <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meulemeester</persRef>, who
							repeated an invitation to his house for to-morrow Evening.— I walked

							and that we must send them a written Note for any such Applications.— We

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> to go as a

							family of <persRef ref="bowdoin-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							he said he had the happiness to be one of the Vice-Presidents, and of a
							Correspondence they had with the Bible Society, in Boston, of which I
							told him I was a member— He expressed great satisfaction at the
							liberality with which they had sent a sum of money to replace the loss
							of some Bibles which had been taken by a privateer as they were going to
							Halifax— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard asked Lord Gambier, upon

								Buonaparte’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="bonaparte-jerome">Son</persRef> was born in England, how
							the doctrine of allegiance would apply to him— His Lordship laughed and
							said, we wont talk about that now. I asked D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Adams to what part of England his family belonged— He said
							that they originally they came from Pembrokeshire in Wales— But they had
							removed from thence four or five generations since, and of late had
							resided in Essex— Their arms were a plain red Cross. They had heretofore
							been possessed of a considerable Estate, in Wales, no part of which
							however had descended to the present generation.— I think we are not

							signed) 1737 in great want of money; and full of bad spelling.—
							Rousseau’s advertisement was in a gilt frame— The librarian had an Album

							come again with my Colleagues— The Mayor promised to come on Monday, and
							go with us to see <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Schamp’s</persRef> Collection of Pictures.— On returning home, I met
							my Colleagues at 2 O’Clock. I had the draught of a Dispatch, accounting
							for the detention of the John Adams— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin objected to a passage, stating that the first cause of this was
							the transfer of the Negotiation to this City—and was supported in the
							objection by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— It was struck out.— <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							had been here from the <persRef ref="gambier-james">British
								Commissioners</persRef>, requesting a Conference at their house at
							3. O’Clock— We went as requested— On taking their seats at the table,
								<persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goulburn</persRef> had a dispatch from their Government before him,
							which he informed us was the answer to that which they had sent by their
							Messenger. He proceeded to state its contents. The British Government
							expressed some surprize that we had not been instructed on the points of
							an Indian pacification, and boundary as it might naturally have been
							expected that Great-Britain could not consent to make a Peace and leave
							her Allies at the mercy of a more powerful Enemy— She might therefore
							justly have supposed that the American Government would have furnished
							us with instructions to agree to an Article on this subject; but the
							least she can demand is that the American Commissioners should sign a
							provisional Article, subject to the ratification of their Government; so
							that if it should be ratified, the Treaty should take effect and if not
							that it should be null and void— And we were desired to understand that
							if unfortunately the conferences should be suspended by our refusal to
							agree to such an Article, Great-Britain would not consider herself bound
							upon a renewal of the Negotiations to abide by the terms which she now
							offers.— As we had requested to be explicitly informed of the views and
							intentions of Great-Britain, in proposing this Article, we were to know
							that the Indian Territories were to be interposed as a barrier between
							the British Dominions and the United States, to prevent them from being
							conterminous to each other, and that neither Great-Britain, nor the
							United-States should acquire by purchase any of those Indian Lands. For
							the line, Great-Britain was willing to take the Treaty of Greenville for
							the Basis, with such Modifications as might be agreed upon— With respect
							to the other boundary line that of the British Territories, Great
							Britain still adhered to the principle of asking for no conquests— But
							as Great-Britain on the side of Canada was the weaker of the two
							Nations, and had no designs of Conquest there, and as it had been stated
							that the United States had on their part had the design of conquering
							Canada, it was required by Great-Britain that the United States should
							stipulate to have no naval force upon the Lakes, from Ontario to
							Superior, and neither to build any forts in future, nor to preserve
							those already built upon their borders. It would also be necessary for
							Great-Britain to obtain a communication between the provinces of
							New-Brunswick and Canada; a mere road from Halifax to Quebec, which
							would take off a small corner of the Province of Maine. These
							Propositions must be <pb n="137" type="ms"/>considered as proofs of the
							Moderation of Great-Britain, since she might have demanded a cession of
							all the borders of the Lakes to herself— She would also require a
							continuance of the right of navigating the Mississippi as secured to her
							by the former Treaties— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin asked
							what was proposed to be done with the inhabitants, Citizens of the
							United-States, already settled beyond the line of the Treaty of
							Greenville—the Territories of Michigan, of Illinois, and part of the
							State of Ohio; amounting perhaps to one hundred thousand; many of whom
							had been settled there with their ancestors an hundred years— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said that their case had not been
							considered by the British Government— That it might be a foundation for
							the United States to claim a particular modification of the line; and if
							that should not be agreed to, they might remove— <persRef
								ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams</persRef>
							said that undoubtedly they must shift for themselves. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard asked whether the proposition
							respecting the Indian pacification and boundary was still presented as a
							sine qua non; to which they answered, that undoubtedly it was.— He asked
							whether that relating to the Lakes was of the same character— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams answered, one sine qua non at a
							time is enough— It will be time enough to answer your question, when you
							have disposed of that we have given you. I observed that for my own part
							I should not wish for another Conference before we should have received
							from the British Commissioners a written statement of their
							propositions— This was agreed to on all sides; and they suggested that
							they should also expect our written answer to their Note, prior to the
							next Conference— I observed there might be in their Note itself some
							things susceptible of verbal explanation, which we might desire before
							we should send the answer, in which case I presumed they would have no
							objection to our asking another Conference— To this they assented,
							though not without some objection from D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Adams, which he finally gave up— They promised to furnish us the written
							Note as soon as possible— <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> himself arrived in this City last Night, and
							proceeds in a day or two to Bruxelles.— Our Conference lasted about an
							hour— On our return home we found <persRef ref="astor-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Astor</persRef> of New-York, and a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Camberlin</persRef>,
							just arrived from Paris, who dined with us— After dinner we had a
							meeting of the Mission, and determined to write another Dispatch to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, but not to
							wait for the written Note of the British Commissioners, nor to delay the
							departure of the John Adams an hour longer— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin made minutes for this dispatch and agreed to make
							the draft of it, to be ready to-morrow morning— In the Evening, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Cabre</persRef> spent a
							couple of hours with us— He is going, as Secretary to the French
							Legation at Copenhagen, and came round twelve leagues out of his way to
							pay us a visit. He was acquainted with us all, and a very intimate
							friend of <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hughes</persRef>. If he had other motives for his visit
							they are unknown to us— He left us at about ten O’Clock this Evening, to
							proceed on his Journey. In my account of our Conference with the British
							Commissioners this morning, I omitted to state the following facts.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin adverting to the late
							Account in the English Newspapers of their having taken possession of
							Moose Island in the Bay of Passamaquoddy, enquired whether the statement
							which had been published was correct; that they meant to keep it— They
							said it was— That it was a part of the Province of Nova-Scotia—that they
							did not even consider it a subject for discussion; M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said he could demonstrate in the
							most unanswerable manner that it belonged to them; and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said we might as well contest their
							right to Northampton-shire. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							asked whether in requiring us to keep no naval force on the Lakes, and
							no forts on their shores they intended to reserve the right of keeping
							them there themselves they said they certainly did— After the Conference
							was finished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, said to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn, that if the conferences were
							suspended, he supposed Goulburn would take a trip to England— Goulburn
							said, yes; and I suppose you will take a trip to America— In general
							their tone was more peremptory and their language more overbearing than
							at the former conferences— Their Deportment this day, was peculiarly
							offensive to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay has an inconceivable idea, that they
							will finish by receding from the ground they have taken.</p>

								<persRef ref="u">Miss Azleton</persRef>— The Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> married <persRef ref="u">their

							in Philadelphia, and an Estate on the Schuylkill near the City, to his
							widow and her Sister who was also a widow, but whose name the Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> did not recollect—a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Penrose</persRef> was the Guardian or
							Trustee of the Estate. Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Glass wished
							information concerning these women, and particularly whether they were
							living— I enquired of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard if he knew
							any thing of those Persons— He knew only M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Penrose— I told the Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> that if he wished
							to write I would forward his Letter— He said he had sent his Regiment on
							to Courtrai, and was about to follow it there himself, and perhaps he
							would write from thence. The <persRef ref="philippedelens"
								>Mayor</persRef> called upon me at eleven and went with me to see
							the Collection of antient medals and other antiquities, of the Curate of
							the Church of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Nicholas, <persRef
								ref="debast-j">De Bast</persRef>. The number of his medals is about
							ten thousand— In the course of two hours I could take only a cursory
							view of them. The completest part of the collection consisted of the
							Roman Medals and Coins— Among them were many of the Consular period, and
							a series of almost all the Emperors from <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Julius Caesar</persRef> to the extinction of the Western Empire.
							The medals of the Popes were also very numerous. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> De Bast is the author of several large works upon the
							antiquities discovered in Flanders— He is now engaged upon a work of
							researches into the Celtic Language. His Library is large and valuable,
							particularly by the great collections of <persRef

								ref="graevius-john">Graevius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gronovius-johann">Gronovius</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="muratori-lodovico">Muratori</persRef> and others. <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Valvyn</persRef> and the
							Mayor told me that the Curate, though acknowledged to be one of the most
							learned men of the Country, was very unpopular, being considered as a
							turbulent restless Spirit, and having taken an active part in the
							political troubles, ever since the insurrection of 1789. under <persRef
								ref="vandernoot-henri">Van der Noot</persRef>— He gave me a copper
							medal, and three pieces of Coin, struck at that time by the Insurgents—
							After returning home I was engaged in writing untill dinnertime— After
							dinner <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Meulemeester</persRef> called upon us, and I went with him, <persRef
								ref="meulemeester-therese">his Lady</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Sister</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Madame van Aken</persRef> to
							the Theatre where they perform once a week, alternately in French and in
							Flemish— It is maintained by a subscription, and the performers are
							persons of the Class of tradesmen, and not players by profession— They
							performed this Evening in French, two Comic Opera’s— Adolphe et Clara,
							ou les deux Prisonniers, and Le Valet de deux Maitres. For a private
							Theatre the performances were as good as I have ever seen. The house was
							very full, and the Audience consisted almost entirely of women— No men,
							inhabitants of the City are admitted, but subscribers, and each
							subscriber is entitled to two tickets for women— But there were in the
							house certainly five women to one Man. Among them I observed a number of
							very handsome women— <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi

								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							though none of us was yet satiated with amendment— Of the part of my own

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard called upon me to produce the
