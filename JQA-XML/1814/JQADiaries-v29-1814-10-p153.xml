							would be to secure another advantage by this step; that of obtaining
							information which might be useful to us, respecting the state of affairs
							at Vienna— The proceedings of the Congress, and the chances favourable
							to our cause which might there turn up— I thought it possible he might
							have an opportunity to obtain valuable information, by his acquaintance
							with the <persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke of
								Serra-Capriola</persRef> the Sicilian Minister, who is there, and
							probably with views which would make him friendly to ours— Of all this,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin expressed his approbation—
								<persRef ref="bates-unknown">Captain Bates</persRef> paid me a
							morning visit, and afterwards dined with us. He brought and lent me a

							to read the Papers— At the meeting I read a translation of my draft for
							a letter to Count Nesselrode; upon which no remarks were made, it being
							considered as belonging to my particular Russian Mission— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that a narrative thus particular
							was very proper to be communicated to the Emperor of Russia, but for a
							similar communication to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>; and I gave the
							reasons upon which I had thought of adopting that course. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell said M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Shaler had been to him, and informed him of his expectation
							of being employed to carry this communication to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaler might be sent to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and at the same time M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith might be sent directly to Vienna. I
							observed that not being perfectly satisfied of the propriety of the
							measure at all, I should send to Vienna only according to the advice the
							mission should give me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he
							certainly should give no advice as to the person to be sent.— I said
							that when I received the Letter from the mission advising me to send to
							Vienna, I should take my measures accordingly— That if they gave me no
							advice, I should communicate the progress and result of the Negotiation,
							to the Russian Government, in the regular form, and after my return to
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.— The Communication to
							Vienna was no measure of mine— It might prove useful or otherwise
							according to circumstances— I doubted still more of the expediency of
							the Communication at present to France— If France <pb n="155" type="ms"
							/>had any motive of her own to seek for the information she would be
							quick enough in seeking it, without our hurrying to give it to her— That
							as to any interest of our own to be promoted by the communication I
							could not readily perceive it— I believed both France and Russia knew as
							well as we did that England did not intend to make peace with us in this
							Negotiation— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>
							at least had been aware of it, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin saw him at London in June—and <persRef ref="harris-levett"
								>Harris’s</persRef> last Letters to me from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg shewed that the Government there still expected
							the same— I thought it deserved also to be considered, if the <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">crown-Prince of Sweden</persRef>, or a Swedish
							Minister should be at Vienna, whether the communication ought not to be
							made to that Government, at the same time as to France and Russia— All
							my Colleagues were of opinion that it should not, though I urged that
							our Instruction from home, applied to that Government as well as to the
							others—that the Communication, of made at the same time, would be taken
							as a friendly act, and if withheld, might be considered otherwise— The
							mission thought it was altogether at our discretion either to make or to
							withhold the communication; and that it would be best to withhold it
							considering the crown Prince’s dependence upon England— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thought M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford should be advised to make the communication to the
							French Government verbally, rather than in writing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was for leaving the manner, at his
							own discretion; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, for having
							it recommended to him, by a private letter to make it verbally— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, at the request of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, promised to draw up a letter of
							advice to me, to send to Vienna—to be submitted for consideration
							to-morrow— After dinner I walked on the Place d’Armes till I was caught
							in a shower— Then spent an hour at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Smith’s chambers; where I met <persRef ref="bates-unknown">Captain
								Bates</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell; and came

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourne</persRef>. At 2 we had
							the meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s draft
							of a letter from the Mission to me was produced— It requested me to send
							a special messenger to Vienna, to communicate to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> the State of our
							Negotiation, and to give us any information which he could collect
							there, and which it might be useful to the public service for us to
							possess. I then requested that they would fix upon the person who should
							be charged with this mission, and also direct me in what manner the
							expence of it is to be defrayed—whether to be charged to the joint
							mission, or to the Legation to Russia— Mr Clay and Mr Russell insisted
							that the selection of the messenger, fell particularly within my
							province as Minister to the Emperor of Russia— I said that <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, being the Secretary of the Legation to Russia,
							known as such to the Emperor, and to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Count Nesselrode</persRef>, was in my opinion the most proper
							person to be charged with the Letter— But there were other duties, which
							concerned the joint mission, and which they proposed should be enjoined
							upon the same Messenger. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith had
							particular advantages for the discharge of this duty, which I had
							yesterday stated; and he was to me, the most confidential person that I
							could employ. But motives of delicacy, well known to them would induce
							me to decline sending him, unless with their approbation. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Russell said that if I insisted upon their recommending a person to them
							it would be <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Shaler</persRef>, for he had been attached to the joint mission for
							that particular purpose (of which however there is no written evidence)
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he did not think M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Shaler the proper person— To deliver the
							letter to Count Nesselrode, there could be no person so proper as the
							Secretary to the Legation to Russia— For the other part of the business,
							it required a person of address, and of habits in Society not possessed
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaler; though he was a man perfectly
							confidential; and of very good understanding. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin asked me whether he should strike out that part of
							his draft recommending the employment of a special messenger, and
							leaving it at my discretion how to send the letter— I said I should then
							send it by the Post— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that
							would not do. I said I should then ask them to indicate to me the mode
							by which I should send the letter. I was ready to say to them in
							writing, what I then said verbally— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell waxed loud and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay very warm— They said they had nothing
							to do with the appointment of the messenger—that it was my business
							exclusively, and if I wanted their opinion they had given it— I said,
							with too much warmth, that they might be assured, I was as determined as
							they were. Each of us must act upon his own responsibility— The proposed
							measure itself was theirs and not mine— Its usefulness was in my own
							opinion problematical; but I was ready to acquiesce in their judgment,
							and to execute their charge— I only asked them to name to me the person
							whom I should send as the messenger; and whoever they named should
							certainly be sent— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said with great
							heat, and anger, that he would give his opinion in writing, that he
							should be ashamed <pb n="156" type="ms"/>not to take such a
							responsibility upon himself; and he added with a scornful sneer, that he
							supposed <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> would send to ask us how he should
							perform our request— A soft answer, turneth away wrath— But I have not
							always a soft answer at my own command—the next best expedient to check
							contention is to suppress all angry reply, and I am not always
							sufficiently master of myself to do that— I was so this day—I was
							silent. The answer was perfectly obvious, that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford had no special messenger to send— That he had no
							share in the responsibility of the measure itself— That he was to be
							requested to perform one of the ordinary duties of his office, and that
							if in the execution of the act recommended by us to him there were any
							circumstance of a delicate nature connected with the mode of performing
							it he would be fully justified in asking our advice and direction in
							relation to it. But I did not say this— I restrained my feelings, and
							made no reply. We adjourned, and I took a short walk before dinner.
							While we were sitting at the dinner-table, the Fourth Note of the
								<persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> was brought to us—it encloses a proposed

							eventually refuse to give their project until we should formally have
							admitted their Article, he was still not for breaking off. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was for rejecting any proposition to
							disarm upon the Lakes if we admitted the present Article; because he
							considered that the two Articles together would deliver the whole
							Western Country up to the mercy of the Indians. The inconvenience and
							danger of admitting any preliminary Article thus dictated was distinctly
							perceived by us, but none of us was prepared to break off upon it.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> produced his draft,
							and I read parts of mine. They differed much in the tone of the
							composition. The tone of all the British Notes is arrogant, overbearing,
							and offensive— The tone of ours is neither so bold nor so spirited as I
							think it should be— It is too much on the defensive, and too excessive
							in the caution to say nothing irritating. I have seldom been able to
							prevail upon <persRef ref="clay-henry;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">my
								Colleagues</persRef> to insert any thing in the style of retort upon
							the harsh and reproachful matter which we receive— And they are now so
							resolved to make the present Note short, that they appeared to reject
							every thing I had written; and even much of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s draft— We agree to accept the Article offered us
							as an ultimatum— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin’s idea is to
							adopt it, as perfectly conformable to the views we ourselves had
							previously taken of the subject— Mine is to consider and represent it as
							a very great concession, made for the sake of securing the Peace. But in
							this opinion I am alone— I also strongly urged the expediency of avowing
							as the Sentiment of our Government, that the cession of Canada would be
							for the interest of Great-Britain, as well as the United States— I had
							drawn up a paragraph upon this subject conformable to our Instructions—
							My Colleagues would not adopt it— My own concern is, that when our
							Instructions come to be published, as they must and will be, they will
							be compared with the arguments pointedly urged in all our Notes, and
							will countenance a charge of duplicity against us and our Government. I
							have believed from the time of the second British Note, that they
							possess copies of our Instructions— But if they do not, our own
							Government must eventually publish them, and although there is nothing
							in our Notes really inconsistent with them, there are many things which
							may be so represented— We have now the opportunity to avow the object of
							our Government, and at the same time to execute our instructions, and to
							guard against the appearance hereafter of their having been detected— I
							was for availing ourselves of it; but cannot obtain the concurrence of
							my Colleagues— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay took the two drafts
							to shorten that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin; and to adopt
							from mine, any thing that he might think proper to be taken— <persRef

							myself sat after dinner, untill past ten O’Clock, conversing upon
							Subjects of American politics, and of our present Negotiation— He was
							extremely friendly, and confidential in his manner, and spoke with an
							open-heartedness which I very cordially returned. He appears very
							anxious for the acceptance of the Article offered us by the British
							Plenipotentiaries, and dwells with the greatest earnestness on the
							project of accomplishing the Peace, or of uniting our whole Country in

								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							immediately said that the day before yesterday Shaler spoke to him in
							the hearing of Stillwell about the contents of the last Note from the
							British Plenipotentiaries to us, as freely as if Stillwell had been a
							member of the mission— Had told him what an able Note it was; and said
							when he had read it he trembled for fear we should not be able to answer
							it— <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> thought but little of all this. He said Stillwell was
							such a stupid fellow, Shaler might say much more in his hearing without
							hazarding any thing—and Shaler had first told him of the young Americans
							who were here upon a stipend from English commercial houses to discover
							and report news from the negotiation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay required that the ode should be taken, whether Shaler should or
							should not go to Vienna— I asked him for his vote first— He said it was
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard to answer first— I asked
							Bayard, who answered <hi rend="italic">no</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> answered the same—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, then declined answering at all,
							but said he had not changed his opinion— I can now comprehend why the
							responsibility of sending Shaler to Vienna was to have been put upon me
							alone, and why Shaler was to have been fastened upon me as the man,
							without any one of my colleagues appearing to have recommended him to
							me— Shaler came in just as the vote had been taken, and all my
							colleagues in a few minutes successively left the room. I was left to
							inform him of the change of our views, and that the mission to Vienna,
							was at least to be postponed— He had been sent by <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> to receive our directions, but did not appear
							dissatisfied at the alteration of our purpose— He said he himself
							thought it was too late and had yesterday said so to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— Stillwell sent us a letter
							stating that he placed the Chauncey at our disposal, though it was
							contrary to his Instructions from his owner to send her home— As we were
							sitting at the Dinner table this Evening, an Italian named <persRef
								ref="ginnasi-julius">Ginnasi</persRef> an acquaintance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s, an Antiquarian and virtuoso,
							who has a project of settling a State of Italians in America, came to
							visit him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin a few minutes after
							left the room—the other Gentlemen did the same and I was left to keep
							company with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ginnasi, who detained me
							more than an hour— In the mean time M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							gave me a letter to the mission just received from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, partly in cypher— On decyphering
							it, I found it contained a proposition, upon which he requested us to
							deliberate, and give him our opinion: I was very desirous to answer the
							letter by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd— I took it first to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, and afterwards to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell at his lodgings; the other
							Gentlemen could not be found— I sent word to them and agreed with
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Russell &amp; Gallatin that we
							should have a meeting at my chamber at nine o’clock to-morrow morning— I
							had some conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, who
							read me a letter he was writing to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, and who now told me he was much dissatisfied with our last
							Note to the British Plenipotentiaries— I reminded him that I had not
							only declared myself dissatisfied with it, but had offered another draft
							and of a totally different character— I asked him why, he had not
							supported me? He said he had expected M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay would have been the most stubborn of us all, upon the point
							relative to the Indians, and finding him give way, and being himself the
							youngest member of the Mission, and being from a State that cared
							nothing about Indian affairs, he had not thought it was his business to
							be more stiff about it than others— I told him of the long conversation
							I had with Bayard, and how powerfully Bayard had operated upon me in it—
							I added that he had previously had a similar conversation with Clay, and
							I believed had worked still more forcibly upon him— Russell said that
							Bayard always talked about keeping a high tone, but when it came to the
							point he was always on the conceding side— I closed the Evening by
							passing an hour at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s</persRef> lodgings.</p>

							remaining papers and dispatches— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							entered a formal complaint about his having been misled in attending the
							meeting of the Society last Evening, and about the non communication of
							invitations to all the mission, when addressed to one— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had received a Note from the
								<persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Intendant</persRef> for us all
							to dine with him to day, and had forgotten to mention it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin explained that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s awkward
							situation last Evening was owing to <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meulemeester’s</persRef>
							mistake, in telling him that the invitation to the meeting and supper of
							the Society was for all— Clay had some reason to be mortified,
							particularly as <persRef ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornelissen</persRef> at the
							Supper-table last-Evening had made a speech to explain how it came that
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Clay, Russell and <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef> had been made honorary
							members not of that Society, but of the other— But Russell, appeared to
							think his dignity most offended— He refused to go to day to the
							Intendants dinner, because there had not been a special invitation
							addressed by name to himself, and he seems to have been nettled at his
							aggregation with the Secretary, Hughes, to the Agricultural and
							Botanical Society, instead of that of the Fine arts and of Letters. He
							said if the people of Ghent, meant to shew us civility they should treat
							us equally— That he assumed for his part no superiority, and would not
							admit of any— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard, by way of
							disclaiming any assumption of superiority, said that any such <pb
								n="162" type="ms"/>pretension would be ridiculous; to which Russell,
							rather sulkily replied yes, it would be very ridiculous— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin came off from this <hi
								rend="italic">bourasque</hi>, coolly, and without loss of temper—
							Fortunately it had no bearing upon me, and I suffered it to pass by—
							While we harmonize upon essential objects it would be a pity to dissent
							upon trifles— We all dined at the Intendant’s, except M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, and <persRef ref="todd-john"
								>Todd</persRef> who was engaged in packing up for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell— <persRef ref="darenberg-prosper"
								>Prince d’Aremberg</persRef>, and some other General Officers were
							there— We stayed the Evening, when there was an additional party of
							Ladies— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay &amp; myself played whist
							with the Intendant’s <persRef ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-marie"
								>Lady</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="u">Madame de

							had a meeting of the <persRef ref="bayard-james">Mission</persRef>, but
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> was not present untill the meeting was over, and

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and myself, which being
							unfinished we agreed to meet every day at 2 O’Clock, until the whole
							project shall be prepared— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							proposes to renew the two Articles of the Treaty of Peace of 1783
							stipulation our right to fish, and dry and cure fish within the waters
							of the British Jurisdiction, and the right of the British to navigate
							the Mississippi. To this last Article however M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay makes strong objections— He is willing to leave the
							matter of the fisheries as a nest-egg for another war—but to make the
							Peace without saying any thing about it; which after the notice the
							British have given us, will be in fact an abandonment of our right— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay considers this fishery as an object
							of trifling amount, and that a renewal of the right of the British to
							navigate the Mississippi would be giving them a privilege far more
							important than that we should secure in return— And as he finds as yet
							no member of the Mission but himself taking this ground, he grows
							earnest in defence of it— He now recurs to our Instructions forbidding
							us to permit our right to the fisheries to be brought into discussion—
							But I observed to him that those Instructions were drawn, without a
							knowledge of the question as it now stands— This is a point upon which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay will evidently have great
							reluctance, in assenting to what, will, I believe, be found necessary—
							After the meeting I walked an hour and <pb n="163" type="ms"/>a half
							until dinner time— The weather was uncommonly fine and warm, and the
							Coupure more crowded with company that I had ever seen it.— In the
							Evening we went to the Theatre— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay are subscribers for the Season— I went into their box—
							The House was much crowded— The performances L’autre Tartuffe ou la Mère
							Coupable, and Paul et Virginie— And worse than mediocrity— On returning
							home I found Letters from <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>—one to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and me, which I decyphered— It

								>Mission</persRef>. We had much conversation upon the delays of the
							British Government, in furnishing us Passports for dispatch vessels—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay was for making a strong
							remonstrance on the subject, and for breaking off the Negotiation upon
							that point if they did not give us satisfaction— As I was beginning to

								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, together with the Times Newspaper to
