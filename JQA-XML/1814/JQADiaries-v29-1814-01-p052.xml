								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> paraphrase of

							great weight is drawn from the countenance given by Christ to the idea
							of his Divinity, and the unfavourable operation upon his character of

						<p><date>3. VI.45. </date>The weather has become so cold that I find it
							almost impracticable to hold a pen, and by a concurrence of Circumstance
							which has often happened to me, I have just now occasion to write more
							than usual— I did write though with pain this morning untill Breakfast
							time— Gave <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> his lessons
							of two or three hours— <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lewis</persRef> called on me to mention his having

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> came according to
							appointment at 2 O’Clock— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard spoke of
							his anxiety to go away, and proposed that we should send a Note to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> urging
							an answer of information what had been the determination of the British
							Government concerning the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> offer of Mediation.— We agreed to
							send such a Note, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard asked me
							to draw up— I told him that as its object had particular reference to
							his own conduct, and his wish to go away, I thought he would best
							express his own ideas, to which he assented— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin mentioned that he had had a conference with Count
							Romanzoff, respecting his own departure, in which he had asked him when
							an answer might be expected from the Emperor.— The Count could not tell; but had observed to
							him as in Confidence that it was solely and entirely on our account that
							he had hitherto delayed to resign his office of Chancellor— That he
							could not transact the Emperor’s business— That the Emperor had
							forbidden any other person to write to him, choosing to correspond with
							him himself— He occasionally wrote him short letters which were all
							kindness and condescension, but answered nothing upon matters of
							business— It was impossible for him, the Count therefore to do the
							business of his Office, and his sole motive for continuing in it had
							been his wish to close the affair of our Mission.— In the course of our
							Conversation I found that the project of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard now is to go to the
							Emperor’s Head-Quarters, and apply to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Count Nesselrode</persRef> for the answer which does not come
							through the channel of Count Romanzoff— The first intimation of this
							intent was given me by <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> last week, but it was
							then confined to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin.— It was this
							day repeatedly suggested by both of them apparently with a view to
							elicit my opinion of its propriety— But as I made no remark upon it,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard at last asked me, whether we
							ought not to ask Count Romanzoff whether it would not be proper— I then
							said that as I did not myself think it proper, I could not think it
							expedient to ask Count Romanzoff’s opinion of its propriety— Both the
							Gentlemen appeared to be very <pb n="53" type="ms"/>strongly affected by
							this expression of my opinion— They both started instantly from their
							seats, and walked to and fro in the chamber in directions crossing each
							other and in great apparent agitation— I observed that there was no
							proper channel of Communication for them with the Emperor at
							Head-Quarters— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said there was
							Nesselrode— I said he was not Minister of foreign Affairs, and would
							certainly receive no Communication from them without an express order
							from the Emperor. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said it was
							not his idea to go themselves to the Head-Quarters; but to go near
							enough to them, to send M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris to them;
							if Harris would go— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that
							Harris was willing to go, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							confirmed, and of which I have no doubt— I said that as it was a matter
							relating to their personal conduct, they must judge for themselves, and
							were not at-all bound by my opinion— Gallatin said we might be blamed
							for not having already sent a Courier of our own to the Emperor’s
							Head-Quarters after the delay that had occured in the former instance—
							Bayard said that he was under a great responsibility, if he stayed—and
							there was also great responsibility in going away.— But the
							Head-Quarters project is Gallatin’s, who acts without any responsibility
							at-all.— Bayard has repeatedly expressed his astonishment to me that
							Gallatin should presume to act at-all, knowing the rejection of his
							nomination by the Senate; and told me the other day, at Count
							Romanzoff’s table that if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had received such
							information, he would not have stayed here two days after receiving it.
							Bayard said he had thought upon fixing on the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st:</hi> for his departure, as it would be that day six Months
							since they arrived. He told me on Saturday that Gallatin had said he
							should go between next Monday and Wednesday— We finally rested upon
							sending a Note to Count Romanzoff, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard is to draft— This Evening it became again severely cold</p>

						<p><date>6. VI. </date>The Russian Christmas— About 9 this morning I

							at the Kazan Church, for the splendid successes of the allies, the

								<persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef>, the
								<persRef ref="nicholas-i;michael2">Grand-Dukes</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="annapavlovna">Grand Duchess Ann</persRef> were there—
							Of the Corps Diplomatique, only <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count

							<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="jouffroy-georg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jouffroy</persRef>, the Prussian Chargé d’Affairs. Neither the
								<persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de

								Walpole</persRef>, the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier
								Bardaxi</persRef>, nor <persRef ref="u">Captain Guedes</persRef>
							were present— The Court circle very thin, and the crowd not great. The
							Cold had abated to about -25. but the Church doors were so continually
							opening and shutting that we had a constant fan upon us; during the two
							hours that the Ceremonies lasted, and before they finished I was
							thoroughly chilled. Instead of a hand-Bill read by the <persRef
								ref="gorchakov-aleksey">Minister at War</persRef>, there was a
							Proclamation of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>,
							dated at Carlsruhe, read by a Chamberlain— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Narishkin told me, it was an order for a Te Deum in all the
							Churches throughout the Empire, to give thanks to God for that whereas
							one year ago, all Europe was against Russia, now all Europe was united
							with Russia in support of the good cause. Count Maistre told me that one
							of the Bishops who usually officiated at these ceremonies, <persRef
								ref="theophylact">Theophylact</persRef>, had lately by an Ukaze from
							the Emperor been ordered away to his diocese; for having translated a
							work of <persRef ref="ancillon-johann">Ancillon</persRef>, a protestant
							clergyman at Berlin, which the <persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy"
								>Metropolitan</persRef> had taken offence at, as containing
							Atheistic, or Pantheistic doctrines, or what they call in Germany
							transcendental Spinosism— The Metropolitan had first employed
							Philaretus, to answer the Book which he had done with great acrimony.
							Theophylact had prepared a reply, which he was refused permission to
							print, and the whole matter was laid before the Emperor who had <pb
								n="54" type="ms"/>ordered Theophylact to go to his diocese, and in
							consequence of the censurable doctrines which he had countenanced, he
							was forbidden to preach any where but in his diocese; which the Count
							thought a strange decision— The Count said he believed there was no
							Atheism, but some protestantism in the doctrines; but the Ancillon was
							determined to justify himself, and would publish an account of all the
							proceedings— So that the affair which had already made a très grande
							sensation would finish by making un bruit épouvantable— After returning
							home I walked an hour to recover the warmth I had lost at the Church.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard spent the Evening with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef> untill 1/2 past
							eleven; and was very full of Conversation— He spoke particularly much of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and not in a very friendly
							style.— He said they had not more communication with each other than
							there was between him, Bayard, and me— He spoke sarcastically of the
							representation Gallatin had made to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, of the motive for the rejection of his
							nomination by the Senate— As if it was only the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President’s</persRef> extreme anxiety to keep
							him in the Office of Secretary of the Treasury— I said that might be the
							idea conveyed by his Note to Count Romanzoff; but that he had only
							stated the facts as they were, and I thought the representation a very
							natural and allowable one— Bayard said he had never seen that note,
							which surprized me. He added that Gallatin had now another project,
							which was, on his return to America to ascribe the whole failure of the
							Negotiation, to the rejection of his nomination; and Bayard thought it
							was a pretension extremely likely, in the temper of parties to take, and
							generally to prevail.— He mentioned again his own great anxiety to
							return home; but said he had concluded to be governed by the opinion of
							the Majority—either to stay—to go to Head-Quarters or to go home— He had
							drafted a Note to Count Romanzoff, and given it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin they day they were here, and
							Gallatin had returned it to him, not untill just as he was going out (to
								<persRef ref="galitzin-michel">Princess Michel Galitzin’s</persRef>)
							this Evening.— I observed that as to a Majority, I did not know how he
							would now find one, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had
							declared he considered himself as no longer belonging to the mission;
							and had very plainly told us that he was aware he was acting without any
							sort of responsibility, which he very certainly was, being neither
							accountable to the Executive, nor impeachable by the House of
							Representatives.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard concurred
							explicitly in this opinion; and he repeated what he has said to me many
							times before— That he had a very short notice of his own appointment—
							That he had barely time to make his preparations for the Voyage, and to
							settle his domestic and professional affairs.— That his only motive for
							accepting the appointment was the belief that it might tend to a
							conciliation of parties.— But as soon as he got on board ship, and
							turned his mind to the subject he had not an instant of doubt but that
							the British Government would reject the Mediation, and he told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin so before they had been three
							days at Sea. That what the British called their maritime rights were
							their pretensions, and they would never submit them to the judgment of
							another Nation, but woud support them with their power.</p>

						<p><date>11. </date><persRef ref="u">Captain Hewet</persRef> of the
							Sea-Lion, one of the American Vessels detained at Cronstadt by the War,
							called upon me this morning with a Note of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>—
							He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris informed him he was going
							away, and he should wish in the Consul’s absence to have some person to
							whose advice he might recur, as circumstances might require; and I
							informed him that my advice should always be at his service, whenever he
							should think it might be useful to him.— About two O’Clock in the
							afternoon I called upon <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							with the draft of the Note for <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>, as I had prepared it. They both read it over,
							and suggested some verbal criticisms, and emendations, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to the French, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard to the English— I readily assented
							to all the alterations they proposed— At length M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard said he did not altogether like the closing sentence
							of my additional paragraph— It was the one stating his intention to ask
							for his Passports— He said that it had the appearance of his deserting
							his duty— No—if there was any duty to do he should certainly not go away
							and leave it for me to do— His idea was in going away to <hi
								rend="italic">terminate the Mission</hi>. I observed that it was
							neither in his nor in our joint power to terminate the Mission— That
							could be done only by the Government which sent us, or the Government to
							which we were accredited—and as to the desertion of his duty, what was
							the duty to be performed?—simply to receive from this Government, and
							transmit to our own an official document the substance of which was
							already perfectly well known to us all. He had conceived himself
							competent to go alone to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Head-Quarters, and ask there for this very
							document, without needing my co-operation— He had even conceived himself
							competent to go to England alone, and there make a Treaty, without <pb
								n="56" type="ms"/>needing any concurrence of mine; if he therefore
							could perform separately, duties of the mission of that magnitude, I
							could not conceive that the mere act of receiving and transmitting an
							official paper, was such as he could not leave to be performed
							separately by me, without any desertion of his duty— He said that any
							idea he might have had, of going to England was not in an official
							character, but it was only to sound the dispositions of the Government
							there; and as to the project of going to Head-Quarters, that was merely
							an idea that had occurred to him, but upon which he had formed no
							determination.— I did not reply to either of these Answers, because
							after bringing to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s mind the
							comparison between his own grounds for being prepared to do so much
							separately, himself, and yet so averse to leaving so little to be
							performed separately by me, I thought it unnecessary to push him too
							hard in argument— In his projects of going to England to make a Treaty,
							all but the signing, (which he explicitly avowed in one of our former
							Conferences) and of going to the Emperor’s Head-Quarters, the thought
							had never entered his head, that he would be taking the whole mission
							upon himself, and dismissing me from my share in it as effectually as if
							I had never been joined in the Commission— I made no objection against
							his going to England, because supposing it possible that the door for a
							Negotiation would thereby be kept open, which might promote the work of
							Peace, I felt it my duty to sacrifice all personal Considerations, to
							the furtherance of the great public object. I was nevertheless fully
							aware that the Negotiation if practicable will be accomplished by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard the only commissioned Envoy, and by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, no longer even in the
							Commission, to the total exclusion of myself— I did think that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard before he came to the determination
							of going to England ought to have thought of this, to have weighed the
							consideration, and to have consulted me concerning it.— I believe he
							never thought of it— Certain it is that he never gave me the remotest
							hint that he had thought of it.— He has now for some weeks been
							declaring his intention to go away without wasting any longer for the
							official Communication from this Government, of the rejection by
							Great-Britain of the Mediation— He has been asking and urging for my
							advice to him, and expressing the most extreme anxiety to go.— I had in
							the paragraph I drew up announced his intention of going, and put it on
							a footing altogether inoffensive to this Government; saying that he
							would leave to me the care of receiving and transmitting the paper, when
							it should suit the convenience of this Government to give it— But the
							instant the idea was presented to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
							of my performing separately the mere act of receiving and enclosing an
							official paper, without his participation— No—it would be a desertion of
							his duty—and if there was any duty to be performed he would stay. I
							thought it therefore proper to bring to his view the parallel of his
							principles in the two cases, and as a bare glimpse was sufficient to
							make it glaring, I forbore to press the comparison upon him, leaving it
							to the operation of his own mind— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin said there was an <hi rend="italic">intrinsic difficulty</hi>,
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s returning to America without
							having first received the document which we expected from this
							Government— That it related not merely to himself, but to the public
							Interest, since the Odium of rejecting the Mediation would in the public
							opinion be thereby transferred from England to Russia— This therefore
							had suggested to him the idea, of going not to Head-Quarters, but near
							enough to send M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris to them; as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had offered himself to go.— I then
							said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard that I had drafted the
							paragraph only on the supposition that he had determined to go.— If
							there was any doubt on his mind, concerning that point, my paragraph
							became useless and improper; and I requested him to strike it out.— He
							said that he should wish to wait for Count Romanzoff’s answer to the <hi
								rend="italic">main point</hi>, before he notified to him his
							intention of going away. Perhaps that answer would contain something
							which might vary that determination— He expressed himself perfectly
							satisfied that my intentions had been good, and it was agreed the
							paragraph should be struck out.— The remnant of the Note was dispatched
							by <persRef ref="gallatin-james">young Gallatin</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris to be prepared for our signature
							to-morrow Morning; and as the Gentlemen were about dressing to go and
							dine at <persRef ref="beloselsky-anna">Princess Beloselsky’s</persRef>,
							I took my leave of them and immediately returned home— I rose this
							morning at VII:30.— The temperature of my Bed-chamber has risen by three
							days warming to +7 degrees: so that I am again able to write in the
							adjoining chamber— The external cold has this day much moderated by the
							thermometer’s, but it has blown a heavy gale of wind with snow falling
							and drifting, so that it was worse for walking than the extreme Cold—
							The sky has again veiled itself in Clouds— And my Astronomy and
							Mathematics sleep, at least during <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> vacation.— I wrote this Evening about two

							Gallatin</persRef> had asked for his Passports and his Audience of leave of the
								<persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef>— He also
							mentioned his own intention of going away— His visit to me on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st:</hi> of December, I have since perceived was
							a sounding— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s project was to go
							round by the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							Head-Quarters taking <persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> and
							Harris with him, and make the occasion to have a direct Communication
							with the Emperor— To effect this it was necessary to have my
							acquiescence and Harris was sent to me to try the experiment without
							informing me what the real plan was— Harris told me then that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had concluded to go; and having
							received a letter from one of his Relations in Geneva, who was very
							desirous of seeing him, and had proposed to meet him in Switzerland, he
							would probably go round by the way of Frankfort, now the Emperor
							Alexander’s Head-Quarters.— But that it was very strange, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard would insist upon staying here, and
							waiting for a document which perhaps this Government never would
							communicate, so that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin would have
							to go away alone. It was the next day after this that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard came and proposed a conference to
							fix upon a time beyond which he should no longer wait, and which he
							proposed should be the 21<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> of this Month;
							six Months from the day of their arrival— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard who had uniformly expressed great anxiety to go, then said, that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin <hi rend="italic"
								>hitherto</hi>, had always given it as his opinion that he, Bayard,
							could not go away without receiving the Emperor’s answer. In the
							conference, the plan of going to Head-Quarters was very gradually
							disclosed to me, and it was only the great agitation of both the
							Gentlemen, when it became necessary to express my opinion of it, which
							shewed me how thoroughly it had been concerted, before I was even given
							to understand that it was thought of.— The plan as well as that of going
							to England, is entirely M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s, who
							not with standing the vote of the Senate on his nomination, has no
							inclination to lose any possible opportunity of being still engaged
							inofficially, in the Negotiation. But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris told me on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> of December,
							that it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s opinion that we
							must yield to Great-Britain upon the point of impressment; because we
							should never obtain Peace without it; and because we should be unable to
							carry on the War, for want both of funds and credit— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard has expressed this opinion to me,
							but Gallatin never did— Every intimation of his opinion upon the subject
							to me has been directly the reverse. He has indeed said nothing on the
							point of impressment lately; but since our late accounts from America
							have informed us of the facility with which the Government obtained the
							late Loan of 7 Millions of Dollars, Gallatin says that he never supposed
							we should find any difficulty in raising Money, after once adopting the
							English manner of making lists, instead of the clumsy one of
							subscriptions.— But with both the Gentlemen prepared to abandon the
							point of Impressment, and with the determination of the British
							Government concerning it, as signified in <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring’s</persRef> last Letter, I doubt whether they will do much
							good by going to England, unless our Government has totally changed its
							principles since they gave our Instructions, and as much prepared as
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard to yield the point of Impressment.— I received this
							afternoon a notification from the <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander"

							such a Note— I told him, not if it could be drawn up in such a form, as
							to avoid giving offence to his Government, and every thing that might
							irritate our own Country against Russia— For I could not but feel the
							neglect of the Emperor in delaying the answer we had been so long
							expecting, and I thought our Country when acquainted with the facts
							would feel it still more sensibly— He said he would make a draft of such
							a Note to-morrow and sent it to me for Consideration. He is so much
							embittered against the Emperor, that I have some apprehension he will
							betray his feelings in the Note— He says <persRef ref="walpole-horatio"

								>Lord Cathcart</persRef> asking from him the confirmation of the

								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef> for Instructions concerning it— That he
							had received from the Emperor’s Head-Quarters a letter mentioning that

						<p><date>19. VI:30. </date>There was this morning a conjunction of the Moon
							and Mercury— The Moon rose at VI:52, and between seven &amp; eight I
							walked out to see if I could discover either of them— It was 56 hours
							before the new Moon— I saw her distinctly, about an hour risen above the
							horizon, and three quarters of an hour before Sunrise; but there was too
							much daylight to allow me to perceive the Planet, although the sky was
							as clear as I ever saw it here, and Jupiter was visible untill within
							half an hour of Sunrise— The Planets Mercury, Saturn, and Uranus are all
							now in the vicinity of the Sun, but I see Venus and Mars every clear
							Evening, and Jupiter both Evening and Morning. I attempted to find the
							Moon in the Meridian, between 10 and 11 O’Clock but there was nothing to
							be seen. I called upon Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> between 2 and 3 in the
							afternoon. In my Translation of the Note to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> I had made but
							one alteration from the Original; it was in relation to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s determination to go away— He had
							mentioned it as a resolution jointly concluded as indispensable, by us
							both— I expressed it so as to appear his own determination as it really
							is.— He said that he had intentionally stated it as our joint
							conclusion, because he had wished it to be the result of my advice as
							well, as of his own opinion— I observed that by signing the Note I made
							myself responsible for all the reasoning upon which his resolution to go
							had been formed, but I thought it best, that the resolution itself
							should appear as his own— He said if so, it should go as I preferred,
							and perhaps there might be a point of delicacy in my appearing to advise
							his going away— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin at my request
							revised the French of my Translation— He made no remark this time upon
							the language; but observed that an alteration was to be made in the
							English draft, to make it conformable to the French Note— It was
							accordingly made, and the Note was sent to <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> to be copied—
							The Draft and Translation had both asked an Audience of leave for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, as well as for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin remarked that according to the etiquette, no <hi rend="italic"
								>Audience</hi> could be granted to a Secretary of Legation; but that
							he must take leave, at an ordinary Circle— We therefore struck out that
							part of the Note— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard then asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, whether he would mention the
							additional paragraph for the Note, which he had suggested to him as
							advisable last Evening.— “Not dissembling”—M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin said, that he had thought we should state the ill
							impression which the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							neglect of sending the answer which we have been so long expecting,
							might make in the United States, and intimate the wish that if he meant
							to answer, and particularly if Great-Britain in refusing the Mediation
							had expressed any disposition for a direct Negotiation, that he would
							still dispatch the answer in time for them, (M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard) to
							receive it before they should leave Europe as otherwise the Emperor’s
							conduct might actually retard the restoration of Peace, which it had
							been the object of his offer to promote— But he said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had thought there might be an
							objection to such a paragraph— I said that I thought it would be best to
							avoid any direct written censure upon the Emperor; because however it
							might be expressed, the Count would feel himself bound in duty to defend
							his Master, and it might lead to a disagreeable and useless discussion—
							But in taking leave of the Count, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							might verbally express any ideas of that kind which it might be useful
							to suggest— We had gone far enough in our reply to the Count’s Note,
							when without noticing at all his zealous apology for the Emperor we
							merely say, we had hoped, after so long a lapse of time, he the Count
							would have been able to give us a definitive answer— I believed the
							Emperor would feel the force of that remark, and I hoped he would feel
							it in a proper manner. They both said they thought the paragraph might
							be so worded as to give no Offence, but it was finally concluded to
							leave it to be given verbally, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							to Count Romanzoff.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin asked me
							some questions relative to the charges I usually made in my Accounts for
							contingent expences of the legation, of which I informed him fully; and
							I told him I had now charged for the loss on Exchange, in consequence of
							his having told me that he had written to me, it was a loss for which
							the United States made allowance— After leaving these Gentlemen I called
							upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, to explain the erasure from
							the Note, relating <pb n="60" type="ms"/>relating to him— I found him at
							dinner, and therefore stopp’d only to tell him the motive for the
							change— In the Evening he sent me the Note to be signed—</p>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s request to sollicit an answer to
							the former of our two recent Notes, and afterwards a second time at the
							Count’s own request.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had desired
							Harris to draw up this statement in writing, and then to put it on
							record in the Official Book of the Mission— On reading it over, it
							immediately struck me, that it ought not to be recorded as an official
							document— First, because there was nothing official in the transaction;
							and secondly, because if so recorded it would be liable to be published
							in America; and many things were said by the Count in the Courts which
							he could not have intended or supposed would ever be published, but
							which might be the cause of giving him great trouble hereafter— I
							observed therefore, that if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							thought proper, he might have a copy of this paper, either on a loose
							sheet, or entered into his separate Book; in which case, I should wish
							to have a copy of it also entered upon mine— As the letters of <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring</persRef> to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had been— But not
							upon the official records of the Mission. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris remarked that besides the objections I had stated, by making the
							Paper an official document, it might appear an improper proceeding on
							his part towards Count Romanzoff, as it certainly would— He mentioned
							that in his Consular capacity, he had informed Count Romanzoff he should
							leave no Vice-Consul, as in the present state of affairs there was
							little or nothing to be done— But if there should be anything it would
							be attended to by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, together with a Copy

							with the Archives of the French Consulate, which <persRef
								ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lesseps</persRef>
							had deposited with him. As <persRef ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayley</persRef> the English Consul
							takes his house, it would be obviously improper to leave them there. In
							my house I have not room for them— He concluded to have them placed in
							an Apartment of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Normon’s lodgings, and
							to leave the key with me.— I read this Evening some pages of <persRef
								ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s</persRef>
							last work, on the Diseases of the Mind— It is a melancholy subject, but
							he treats it in an amusing manner. There is nothing profound in his
							theory; and he appears rather prone to infer a general Cause from
							solitary particular effects; a source of much error in the Science of
							Medicine, and in many others— The Evening was clear, but dim, and we
							surveyed the skies without making any discoveries.</p>

								<persRef ref="smith-adam">Adam Smith’s</persRef> fragment on the
							History of Astronomy, of which he had never heard and which I promised
							to send him. I asked him about <persRef ref="kepler-johannes"
								>Kepler’s</persRef> Manuscripts, which are in the Library of the
							Academy of Sciences, and of which he told me he had made great use in
							composing his Popular Astronomy. He did not recollect among Kepler’s
							Manuscripts <pb n="61" type="ms"/>having seen the one against <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvin</persRef>, but he had paid not much
							attention to the theological works. He would however look over them
							again and see if he could find the one about which I enquired— There
							were twenty-four Volumes of the Manuscripts, among which was a
							collection of Letters; but there were few of them that were interesting,
							so as to deserve publication— One of the letters is to <persRef
								ref="kepler-unknown">his wife</persRef>, in answer to a request from
							her that he would send her some money to buy fire-wood in the midst of a
							severe Winter— He writes that he has no money to send her, and can get
							none; but he advises her to apply to <persRef ref="brahe-tycho"
								>Tycho</persRef>, and hopes he will lend them so much as she wants
							for fire-wood. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schubert spoke of the
							Comet of 1811. which he said had been observed by one of the travelling
							Members of their Academy, long after it had been supposed that it would
							be no longer visible; and from those Observations it was ascertained
							that the Period of that Comet was more than 3000 years— From M<hi

							shewed by putting them into M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s

							having copies of his letters, I shall not insist upon them— We agreed to

							not time, being engaged in his preparations for departure and if I

							decyphered of the dispatch from the Sec<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> of

							withdrawn from the Mission— His Note having been written to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, announcing this,
							on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of November— As the Powers had
							been originally entrusted to him, he thought himself answerable for the

							intended to make of them was to give the Powers to treat with
							Great-Britain to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, and the Power to
							treat with Russia to me— Neither of them were now of any validity, as a

							and myself— But this was what he thought the most proper disposal of
							them.— I asked again what was to be done with Count Romanzoff’s Original

						<p><date>28. VI:30. </date>On rising this morning I found the sky clear, but
							in the lapse of half an hour there was too much daylight to discern the
							stars— I had only time to ascertain the two Stars in the scales of
							Libra, which were so faint that I could barely perceive them. In
							addition to the Northern Constellations which I had already found out I
							traced though not with perfect certainty part of Perseus, the foot of
							Andromeda, and Capella descending to the Horizon, which I had only seen
							at Night, and near the Zenith— Looking as I do through double windows,
							and into an atmosphere always loaded with vapours, I find I can perceive
							with the naked eye no smaller stars than those of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> magnitude—and then only when 25 or 30
							degrees above the horizon. My only assistance is an Opera-Glass of
							Ramsden, which shews more distinctly the same stars which the eye can
							see but dimly.— I made out a list of the Stars of the first magnitude on
							<persRef ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Charts— They are 17. two of which, one in the foot of the
							Centaur; and the other very near it in the Cross, are not mentioned
							either by <persRef ref="schubert-friedrich">Schubert</persRef> or
								<persRef ref="lalande-jerome">La Lande</persRef>— And I added four
							others of the second magnitude, but which some Astronomers rank with
							those of the first— Schubert names 12 of the first, and seven of the
							second with pretensions to rank as of the first— La Lande says there are
							15 of the first, but names only 14. and 3 of the Pretenders.— Bode
							includes Athair, Procyon, and Spica among the first, and leaves Alphard,
							Castor, Deneb and Denebola among the second. Five of these Stars never
							rise at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— Acharnar, Canopus,
							Fomahant, and the two in the Centaur and Cross— Four of them, Castor
							Capella, Deneb, and Waga never set— Antares rises only four degrees
							above the horizon so that I have not yet discovered him; and Sirius, so
							celebrated as the brightest Star of the Heavens, being only 13 degrees
							above the horizon scarcely seems a star of the first Class.— The day and
							Evening were Cloudy— Nothing to be seen— <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi

						<p><date>29. VI:30. </date>Another morning like that of Yesterday. Quite

							yesterday the two principal Stars of Libra, and found that two others
							which I see from the North side of the house; were the twins, Castor and
							Pollux descending to the Horizon. They are so situated that one of them
							never sets while the other sinks beneath the Horison about an hour every
							day.— I resumed the reading of <persRef ref="biot-jean">Biot’s</persRef>
							Astronomie Physique, and read part of his Chapters on Refractions and
							Parallax; but they have too much Algebra for me to understand them—
							Inspected <persRef ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Charts again. The
