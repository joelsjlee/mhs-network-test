						<p><date>1. VII:15. </date>I found my self this morning far from well; but
							so much better than I was last Evening that I was able to go out; and at
							11. O’Clock went with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to the Roman Catholic
							Maltese Chapel, and attended the funeral obsequies of <persRef
								ref="bardaxi-dona">Madame de Bardaxi-Azara</persRef>, to which we
							had been invited by <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">her
							husband</persRef>. The Chapel was full and all the foreign Ministers
							were there, excepting the <persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de
								Serra-Capriola</persRef>, who is unwell. On my return home I found a
							note from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>
							requesting me to call on him at 9. O’Clock this Evening at his house on
							the English Quay. I went accordingly at that hour. The Count said that
							as he was on the point of <hi rend="italic">abdicating</hi>, he wished
							to persevere untill the last in the habits which he had formed and
							constantly observed with me, and would therefore shew me the dispatch
							from <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>, which he
							had received yesterday by a Courier from the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Head-Quarters— He then put it into my hands—it
							was numbered 260. dated 26. November/8 December 1813. and marked that a
							duplicate was sent to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode</persRef>. It stated that the British Government having
							been informed of the definitive refusal by the <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">American Ministers</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg to negotiate directly with
							them for Peace, on account of the limitation of their powers to a
							Negotiation under the Emperor’s Mediation, <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> had communicated
							to him Count Lieven, that in order to avoid some of the delays which
							would arise from waiting untill the Envoys could write to their
							Government for further Instructions and Powers, he himself had just
							written to <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, proposing to him to send his Instructions through
							the medium of <persRef ref="warren-john2">Sir John Warren</persRef>, and
							explaining the motives upon which Great-Britain had declined treating
							with the United States under a Mediation.— That as this measure had been
							taken at a period so splendid for England, it would prove to the Emperor
							of Russia that they entered cordially into his views, in the disposition
							to terminate a War—which they considered as not conformable to the
							Interests of the British Nation— The Count asked me if I had already
							received information of this— I had not— He had supposed it might have
							been communicated to me by Lord Walpole— I had seen him this Morning,
							but he had said nothing of it to me.— The Count told me that he had
							received no other Communication upon this subject from the Emperor or
							from Count Nesselrode— That the Courier who brought it to him had also
							brought an immense number of Packets, addressed to him which had been
							accumulating there for several weeks; but not even the Ratifications of
							the Peace with Persia; the term for exchanging which was already past.—
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> had been with him this Evening; and had told him he
							should call upon him again to take leave. <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had written
							to him at the time of his departure, requesting him to write to them
							whatever might occur after their departure in reference to the Mission.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had offered this Evening to
							take his letters— He would write with pleasure to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, as an Evidence how much he
							valued his correspondence— But he had told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harris and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin himself
							must be sensible that as Chancellor of the Empire, after the departure
							of those Gentlemen he must consider their Mission as terminated, and
							could write nothing to them concerning it— Nor could he have any
							occasion to regret this, since I was here to whom he should naturally
							make every proper Communication of business, and who would of course
							transmit all the material information to them— He had therefore not
							mentioned this dispatch this Evening to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris, because I was the person to whom he thought proper to make it
							known. When <persRef ref="dallas-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dallas</persRef> went from hence, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin had asked him the Count to recommend him to the Ambassador
							Count Lieven, and to hear what he should say to him, respecting the
							State of our Negotiation here— He had accordingly strongly recommended
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas to Count Lieven, and with much
							pleasure, as he knew it would procure to the Count an agreeable
							acquaintance. And the Count had informed him that he had received M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas with pleasure— I said I hoped he
							was not in earnest in what he had said and repeated several times about
							abdicating— Altogether in earnest he said— He had more than once written
							to the Emperor requesting him to accept his Resignation. On the occasion
							of sending to him the Treaty of Peace with Persia, he had reviewed the
							request. The Emperor had answered him, that he justly appretiated the
							high and honourable character, and the importance of this Treaty—and
							concluded by saying—“Il y a dans la derniere ligne de votre lettre une
							idée à la quelle je ne puis pas me faire.”— Upon which, said the Count,
							I have replied to the Emperor, insisting upon my resignation; and
							recalling to his recollection that after the Peace of Tilsit, with which
							I had nothing to do, when he laid his commands upon me to take the
							Department of foreign Affairs he told me that he had then two Wars upon
							his hands; that with Turkey and that with Persia; and had just
							contracted the engagement of commencing two others; with Sweden, and
							with England— These four Wars are now all brought to a termination; the
							Peace with Persia closes the last of them; it <pb n="65" type="ms"
							/>brings to a natural conclusion all the business upon which I came into
							Office, and affords to the Emperor an opportunity to dismiss me, “avec
							bonté.”— I have in truth now, no other business to do— The Emperor when
							he went away determined to write to me upon business, exclusively,
							himself— He has entered upon other business, other engagements— He not
							only commands his own army, but oversees and superintends the interest
							of all the Allies— Insensibly he has dropped the habit of writing to me
							at-all. His time is absorbed; he is always intending to write me in one
							or two days— Multitudes of letters come from the Head-Quarters upon
							business saying that the orders on this that and the other affair will
							certainly be dispatched to me in one or two days; and the orders never
							come. I have nothing to do. To be Chancellor of the Empire for the sake
							of signing Passports, and giving answers about law-suits is not
							worth-while—and yet, the office keeps me here in a state of perpetual
							subjection— I cannot sleep out of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Peterburg; I cannot attend to my private affairs— I cannot visit my own
							Estates, which I very much desire to do— I therefore intreat the Emperor
							to give me my discharge, and leave me to bless him for all his favours,
							and to wish him all happiness and Prosperity.— I expect now every day to
							receive the Emperor’s acceptance of my Resignation— It is not more than
							four or five days since it would have been possible by the course of
							time that I should have received it— Now, it may come every hour, and an
							answer must be given to my application— I told the Count that I could
							not but express my personal regret at his determination— He said that as
							to his personal sentiments they would always remain the same; but he
							must do as his old Grandmother told him once after she was turned of
							eighty, told him she was resolved to do— After two years more, she told
							him she was determined to turn over a new leaf; to change entirely her
							course of life; and to go and live at Moscow— I, said the Count am not
							quite so old, as my Grandmother was then; but I am sixty; and have not
							so good health as she had— I shall not wait two years to turn over my
							new leaf— My feelings are entirely American (Je puis dire que j’ai les
							Entrailles Américaines) and were it not for my age and infirmities I
							would go now that that Country. In the whole of this Conversation there
							was not a syllable uttered by the Count in the nature of complaint— His
							tone was altogether that of cheerfulness and pleasantry— The wounded
							Spirit was only to be seen in the allusion to the four Wars, of which he
							reminded the Emperor, and which hung upon him when the Count entered
							upon his office— All these Wars have been closed honourably; three of
							them gloriously for Russia during the Count’s Administration—the
							Commemoration of them must carry a Reproach to the Emperor’s Heart; but
							it indicates a proud consciousness in the Count of his own Services; and
							a firm and independent Spirit in referring to them.— He said that from
							the commencement of the New-Year he had removed from the Hotel of the
							Department of foreign Affairs to his own house, and was there quietly
							waiting for his discharge— I spoke to him about the translations of the
							official documents concerning our War with England, which he had
							promised me should be published in the Gazettes, and which afterwards at
							his request I had consented to leave unpublished, untill the
							determination of the British Government on the offer of Mediation should
							be known— He said he thought that after this new step of England towards
							a direct Negotiation, there was still the same reason to avoid the
							publication—to forbear from all irritating acts— That if I absolutely
							insisted upon it, they should be published, but Lord Walpole had already
							reproached him for what he had published, concerning the American
							Mission, and any such publication at this time would be entirely imputed
							to him— This is certainly true; and it might in the present state of
							things, be of such consequences to him personally that I concluded not
							to insist upon the publication— I told him that as he placed the matter
							upon the ground of a personal favour to him, I should say no more; but
							that he had formally and repeatedly promised me the publication should
							take place— That I had asked it, because the English documents, to which
							these were answers had been previously published in the same Papers—
							That the Emperor had declared himself neutral, between the United States
							and England— That he had offered them his Mediation, which the United
							States had accepted— They had not merited any act of his Government
							indicating partiality against them; and if I consented now not
							positively to demand the publication of these Papers, I should at least
							not expect to see any more extracts from the English Newspapers,
							concerning their War with us, injurious to my Country and its
							Government— That such paragraphs did even now appear; He asked in what
							paper— I named the Invalid— He said he had no controul over that Paper;
							though it was under the controul of the Police— That the Papers under
							his direction were the political part of the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg Gazette; Russian and German; and the whole of
							the Conservateur Impartial— That there was a paragraph in that of this
							day, stating that there had been a bloody Battle in Canada, in which 300
							English had totally defeated 8000 Americans— It had appeared to him
							ridiculous and self-contradictory—a bloody Battle and 300 men was a
							contradiction in terms— But it was merely an extract from an article in
							a German Gazette— I told him I had been going to mention that very
							article to him, together with that in the Invalid— He said that he would
							to-morrow give orders, <pb n="66" type="ms"/>that nothing respecting the
							War between America and England should be published in either of those
							Papers, excepting the mere statement of military Events.— On my return
							home from the Count’s I found <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis</persRef>, who passed the
							remainder of the Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy</persRef> and <persRef

						<p><date>4. VII:15. </date>I am in such a state of health, that my system of
							early rising yields to it. <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> called upon me this
							morning, and told me that he should postpone his departure, untill next
							Tuesday— He brought me my letter Book, of the joint Mission, to which
							some Additions, are still to be made— I told him that before he went
							away there were two subjects, upon which I thought it best to have some
							explanation, with him— The first was to enquire whether he had formed a
							commercial connection with <persRef ref="brown-lawrence">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence Brown</persRef>, an English
							merchant in this place; and if he had, whether he considered it as
							compatible with the office of Secretary to a legation for negotiating
							Peace. He said he had not—that <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman</persRef> had
							formed, or was forming some such connection with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brown, though he had told him this morning there were some
							difficulties in it, of which they had not been aware. That he himself
							had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown that he could not think of
							any such connection previous to the Peace; but as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown had been unfortunate and was a very
							worthy man, he had promised him that if the connection between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman and him
							should take place, he, Harris upon returning to America would do every
							thing in his power, to promote their Interests of a commercial Nature.
							For he assured me that he did consider any commercial connection, with a
							British subject as altogether incompatible with the Office of Secretary
							to the Legation— I told him I was satisfied with his positive Assurance
							that he had formed no such connection— That I had asked the question not
							for the sake of prying into his private concerns, but because I had
							heard he had formed a partnership with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brown; and had the fact been so, I thought my duty to the Public
							required me to give him my opinion that such a connection was not
							compatible with the Office of a Secretary to such a Legation, or <pb
								n="67" type="ms"/>at least, that during the existence of the
							Legation, it would interdict all correspondence whatsoever between him
							and his partners. He said he was fully sensible of that, and had
							declined any connection of that sort with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brown, and before that, with <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis</persRef>— The second object of
							my enquiry was whether <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> had ever said any
							thing to him with regard to my dispositions towards him— He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had once said to him—“M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris; I have reason to believe M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams is no friend of yours.” that he,
							Harris had asked him upon what grounds he had formed such an
							opinion—that he had avoided particularizing, but had repeated, he had
							very good reason to believe I was not friendly to him; or that he was no
							favourite in my family— All he would say further was, that I did not
							like Harris’s Politics, and that my motive for being unfriendly to him
							was that he was the Secretary to the Extraordinary Mission, instead of
								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">my Nephew</persRef>— Harris
							said that these suggestions had given him great pain—that excepting on
							one occasion which he had hoped would be forgotten, he was conscious of
							never having given me occasion to be unfriendly to him—that as to his
							Politics, he could have none but those which favoured the interests of
							his Country; and that he had taken no step whatsoever to obtain the
							Office of Secretary to the Legation— I told him that I would deal with
							him in perfect Candour— It was possible that in Conversation with
							Bayard, I might at sometime have lightly said Harris is more of a
							Russian, or takes more pleasure in the success of the Allies than I do—
							But that I had certainly never said any thing to him which could warrant
							him in making the inference that I was unfriendly to him; and that his
							imputation of the motive was as false as the insinuation itself. That I
							had never wished that my Nephew should have had the appointment of
							Secretary to this Mission; and if I had, I should never have been
							unfriendly to him, Harris, because he had been preferred— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard and I had formerly been in strong
							opposition to each other in the Senate of the United States— When he
							came here one of my most earnest wishes was to harmonize with him— I had
							uniformly treated him with respect and attention— There had been no
							misunderstanding or variance between us; but he had repeatedly made
							attempts to injure <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> in my opinion; and
							I had now reason, since their departure to believe that he had made
							similar attempts against me upon the mind of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin— I should feel a stronger resentment against him
							for this, had I not found that tale-bearing and strife-stirring was so
							congenial to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s character that he
							applied it to others as well as myself, and exerted it impartially
							against all his acquaintance— That he was addicted to intemperate
							habits, and when his wine worked upon his natural temper its uniform
							operation was to set his tongue to mischief-making.— Harris said it was
							all too true— That he had entertained a very exalted idea of Bayard’s
							character before he came here; that it had sunk now so low that he was
							ashamed of him as a Countryman.— That during the latter part of the time
							that he had been here, he was almost every evening so intoxicated that
							he had made himself the scorn of his own Servants, and of the People of
							the house where he lived; and that the very night when he went away he
							got into his carriage in a condition fit for nothing but to go to bed—
							That he had quarreled with <persRef ref="milligan-george"
								>Milligan</persRef>, which had been the occasion of Milligan’s
							leaving him. That he had asked him Harris, to speak to Milligan, and
							effect a reconciliation between them—that he had spoken to Milligan,
							accordingly, but without success— That Milligan was so exasperated with
							what he thought Bayard’s ill treatment of him, that he would listen to
							nothing; and that he made no scruple of saying that he considered Bayard
							as a common Sot— I said I had heard that Bayard had reported to him,
							something said of him by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin; with
							which he would naturally be displeased— He said that one morning, Bayard
							said to him, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris; Milligan will tell
							you some Conversation we had last Evening about you—that he had asked
							Milligan what it was—that Milligan had endeavoured for some time to put
							him off, and said it was all mere joking— But on Harris’s insisting, he
							had said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin the Evening
							before, at supper, being warm with wine, (which Harris said he had never
							observed Gallatin to be, but which Milligan told him he certainly had
							been at that time) had said something about Harris and women; a mere
							trifle which he Milligan told it, was nothing; but that Bayard himself
							had afterwards told it to him, and given it a turn, which was certainly
							displeasing— Harris was not more explicit— But the Conversation was
							this— Bayard asked Gallatin, why Harris did not visit more intimately at
							<persRef ref="galitzin-michel">Princess Michel Galitzin’s</persRef>— Gallatin answered that the Princess was a
							woman of too much sense to take notice of such men as Harris— “No,
							Sir—it is such men as <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; that Princess Michel,
							distinguishes by her notice”— And this was the speech of Gallatin’s that
							Bayard was so studious of reporting to Harris; that he first set
							Milligan to make the report, and finding he had not made it malignant
							enough, took care to make it so himself.— Another of Bayard’s good
							offices to Gallatin was this— Dining one day at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Krehmer’s</persRef> where there was a
							mixed company, among whom was <persRef ref="gisborne-thomas"
								>Gisborne</persRef> and some other Englishmen, Bayard said he would
							tell them of a debate which <pb n="68" type="ms"/>once took place in the
							House of Representatives of the United States, when they were both
							members of that body— It was upon a Bill for raising Troops, and a
							member of Gallatin’s party had called them <hi rend="italic"
								>mercenaries</hi>; at which some offence had been taken by members
							on the other side— That Gallatin to justify his fellow partizan had said
							that the term mercenary did not imply any thing offensive; that it
							signified only persons paid for their services— That soldiers might
							properly be called mercenaries, because they were paid— And in the same
							sense there were mercenary Divines, mercenary Physicians, and mercenary
							lawyers— Upon which, said Bayard, I rose and said that [“]the Gentleman
							in his list of mercenaries had forgotten to enumerate the mercenary <hi
								rend="italic">Patriots</hi>— Foreigners, who came into the Country;
							ever declaiming about patriotism, and ever ready to sell themselves to
							the highest bidder.” Lewis was present at this dinner; but had left the
							table and the dining-Room with the Ladies, before Bayard told the Story—
							But immediately afterwards Gisborne came into the Room, and
							said—there—we have always heard that Gallatin was a venal frenchman, and
							now we have it from his own Colleague— And then repeated the whole Story
							as Bayard had told it.— He told it over a fortnight afterwards again to
							Harris—upon which Harris said he had thought it his duty to speak to
							Bayard.— He reminded him that Bayard had once said to him “M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris; as we are not likely to make a
							Treaty here for our Government, I should like to make a Treaty of
							friendship with you.” That he had accepted the proposition with much
							pleasure and gratitude, and would now perform an act of friendship to
							him; by advising him to be cautious, in what manner he spoke of his
							Colleague in mixed companies— He then told him what he had heard from
							Gisborne; and said he must be aware that such things, said in such
							Company were very apt to be reported two days afterwards to the Court.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard he said had taken his advice
							in good part; and appeared to be sensible of his own indiscretion. I
							observed to Harris that I hoped never again to be placed in relations
							which would make it necessary to associate with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard— But as I possibly might, and should have every
							reason to expect a continuance of his favours like those I had learnt of
							since his departure, I asked of him, Harris, that if Bayard should ever
							again, report or insinuate any thing to him, the tendency of which was
							to excite enmity or dissension between us, he would immediately inform
							me of it, and give me the opportunity of clearing it up— He solemnly
							promised that he would— I told him that I neither asked nor wished him
							ever to tell me any thing else, that Bayard might say to him of me; for
							I cared very little what a man capable of such conduct said or thought
							of me.— I added that I had found no difficulty in getting along with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin; and excepting his last
							letter to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>,
							requesting the Count to correspond with him on business of the Mission,
							which the Count as well as myself had thought a little singular, I had
							no cause to complain of him— Perhaps he might explain that— I had a much
							higher opinion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s abilities
							than of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard was an eloquent Speaker in a popular Assembly; but of
							his abilities for any thing else, I had seen little evidence here— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s had struck me very powerfully
							in our Conferences with Count Romanzoff— In his Note upon the
							Impressment of Seamen—and in his letter to <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring</persRef>— Harris agreed with me, and said he had been
							surprized to see how weak and clumsy the Papers drawn up by Bayard
							were.— Gallatin he said had uniformly spoken well of me to him; only he
							had once hinted he thought I did not make Show enough here in my living—
							That he, Harris had told him I lived to the extent of my Salary; and
							Gallatin had said there was no chance that the Government would raise
							the Salaries of the Ministers abroad during the War. I have noted down
							the particulars of this Conversation with Harris, because they shew the
							character of one of the Men with whom I have been associated, and with
							whom it is possible I may be associated again— The public Interest
							requires a suppression of all the feelings of resentment which has
							conduct deserves; but this record may serve as a Monitor of
							Circumspection to myself, if I should be destined ever to act with him
							as a Public Servant again— His talk about M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin to me, and before <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;adams-charles2">my family</persRef> was
							often such as is not fit to be repeated— He made himself so odious to
							Lewis, Milligan and <persRef ref="todd-john">Todd</persRef>, that they
							could no longer keep terms with him; and one of the most characteristic
							treats they told of him was, that he called in to him one day, a Black
							Servant to ask him what he heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milligan say about him, when they
							were alone. One of his grounds for quarreling with Milligan, was that
							Milligan did not report to him what he heard said of him in the
							Societies that he frequented— Lewis says that one evening he threw a
							pack of Cards into Todd’s face—and that to save the wages of his Black
							Servant, he beat him to make him look out for another place— This is the
							man, with whom I was to live in Harmony.— <persRef

							have a like effect upon them, towards him— It is an excellent exercise
							of spelling as well as of writing, and it accustoms his mind to habits

							the blessing of Heaven that the success may answer to my intentions. I
							continued my Chronological Dissertation, with painful efforts to
							disentangle its confusion. I am extremely dissatisfied with what I have
