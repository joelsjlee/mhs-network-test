						<p><date>1. VI. </date>About seven this morning <persRef ref="gahlroos-axel"
								>my Servant</persRef> returned from his expedition back in search of
							his Portmanteau, which had been fruitless— The Post-master promised to
							have it advertised this day at the Village Church, and to have it
							forwarded to Reval, if it should be found— At eight O’Clock we proceeded
							on our Journey, and just before eleven, entered the Gates of Reval— I
							was met almost at the Gate, by <persRef ref="walther-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther</persRef>, the Son in Law of
								<persRef ref="rodde-diedrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rodde</persRef>, and by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Riesenkampf</persRef> his partner— They conducted me to
							the Apartments they had engaged for me, in the Langestrasse at the house
							of a Tailor named <persRef ref="u">Dahlström</persRef>— The chambers are
							perfectly convenient, pleasantly situated and neatly furnished— They had
							written yesterday to the Postmaster at Jegelicht, requesting him to
							inform me on my arrival there, where the lodgings were provided for me,
							which he did. As I entered the City, and all the Bells were ringing, and
							the Streets were in a tumult of rejoycing for the taking of Paris, and
							the subsequent Events, which were known here just as I had left them at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg; with the addition that
							the Peace was already concluded at Paris— There had already been here
							two successive illuminations, and this Evening was to be the third— I
							had scarcely had Time to Change my Clothes, before three young Gentleman
							came, as a deputation from the Club of the Young Merchants, and invited
							me to attend this Evening their celebration of the late glorious news
							from the Armies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther also invited me
							to go with him in the Evening to the theatre where there was to be a
							musical celebration of the same Events— At six, he called upon me again
							and I went with him to the Theatre. It is larger than either of the
							Theatres now remaining at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg,
							and was built about four years ago, under the direction of <persRef
								ref="kotzbue-august">Kotzebue</persRef>, who was then an inhabitant
							of this City— His family are still here; but he is himself now Russian
							Consul at Königsberg in Prussia. The celebration of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> Victories, and the taking of
							Paris was a musical Performance; sung by all the singers belonging to
							the Theatre, and was followed by a German Translation of La Revanche;
							which I had seen performed in French at the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence’s</persRef> when he was
							Ambassador at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg. After the
							Play, I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther to the Club of
							the young Merchants to which I had been invited— It is a sort of a Dutch
							Coffee-house, where there was an assembly of People, drinking, smoking
							and playing Cards. The Institution has existed upwards of a Century, and
							was formed under the Swedish Government. All the Young Merchants as soon
							as they finish their apprenticeship are obliged to become members of the
							Society; which is a <pb n="96" type="ms"/>Corporation and has several
							privileges conferred by <persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter the
								Great</persRef>— Among which is that of wearing an Uniform; in which
							all the Marshals were dressed on the present occasion— About 11 O’Clock
							this Evening, the City being illuminated they made their procession by
							torch light, with a band of instrumental music and of singers,
							thundering the principal Russian National Air. The Marshals in full
							Uniform, preceded by the Music vocal and instrumental and followed by
							the members of the Society marched out with a Bust of the Emperor
							Alexander, followed by one of the Marshals carrying a crown of Laurel,
							upon a velvet Cushion— They proceeded to the Public Market Place, and
							there in the presence of all the People, placed the crown of laurel upon
							the head of the Bust, with three times three huzza’s of the whole
							multitude— They then returned to the Hall of the Society, and replaced
							the Bust crowned with laurel, in its former stand— They were preparing
							the Supper table; when it being past Midnight, I retired to my lodgings;
							and there, immediately to bed. A <persRef ref="whitlock-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitlock</persRef>, an Englishman was
							introduced to me at the Club; an Agent for Lloyd’s Coffee-house,
							residing here; with whom I had some Conversation. I also saw a <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Weymouth</persRef>; Master of the Schooner bound to
							Gothenburg in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde advised me to
							take my passage. There were two French Officers, Prisoners, present; who
							had been invited by the Club. They kept their Countenance without any
							appearance either of dejection or of affectation— A Russian Merchant
							with the Caftan and beard, went up and shook hands with them both,
							repeatedly saying “nu—alle Camaraden”— Now we are all Comrades— They
							shook hands with him with apparent cordiality; but said Nothing to him
							in Answer— The company in general appeared to be in the true Spirit of
							enjoyment; but without any mixture of turbulence or disorder.</p>

						<p><date>2. VII. </date>I was awaked this morning, at seven, by a band of
							music in the Street before my door, and the closing procession of the
							Club, the Marshals and members of which were dispersing, and retiring to
							their homes, in the plenitude of their festivity. I employed the morning
							in writing. At eleven <persRef ref="walther-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther</persRef> called on me, and
							went with me to visit <persRef ref="u">Admiral Spiridoff</persRef>, the
							military Governor of the City. The Civil Governor, <persRef
								ref="uexkull-berend">Count Exkull</persRef> is sick, so that I
							postponed my visit to him— After the visit to the Admiral, we went down
							to the Harbour, to look out for Vessels bound to Sweden, in which I
							could take a passage. The first, on board of which we went was <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Weymouth’s</persRef> Vessel; a schooner, bound
							directly to Gothenburg— But I found her too small. Her cabin was not
							more than ten feet square and four feet high— It would be impossible to
							stand below the deck during the whole passage— And with such
							accommodations he asked me an hundred pounds Sterling for the passage—
							The second was a brig, under the Russian Colours; the Diana, <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Wilkins</persRef>; bound to Liverpool; but he
							engaged to land me at Helsingborg or Elseneur, on passing the Sound. His
							price was forty pounds— The third was also a brig under Russian Colours;
							the Ulysses, <persRef ref="u">Captain Brinkman</persRef>; bound to
							Stockholm— The Captain was unwell and not on board— The accommodations
							indifferent— The price; as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther
							informed me this afternoon, thirty-five pounds—to which I objected as
							excessive— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther promised to bring the
							Captain to me to-morrow Morning.— <persRef ref="sterky-carl">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sterky</persRef>, the Swedish
							commercial agent, at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, had
							given me a letter for <persRef ref="thomasclayhillsandson">Thomas
								Clayhill and Son</persRef>; merchants here— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ross</persRef>, a partner of the house
							called upon me this afternoon; and I delivered the Letter to him. He
							told me that the Diana, and Ulysses were both loading by their house—
							That they were both good vessels, and had good Captains. That he should
							himself take passage in the Ulysses for Stockholm if he could get his
							Passport in time— Towards Evening I walked with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Walther to the Dome; an hill upon which stands the Castle of
							the City, and from which there is a fine prospect of the harbour and
							gulph; with the neighbouring islands, and the Country round the City—
							The remainder of the Evening I passed at my lodgings, writing.— I made
							few remarks on my Journey from S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg; the natural character of my mind being more adapted to
							reflection than to observation— The face of the Country at this Season
							presents very little to the observation of any one. It is generally
							level, though between Narva and this City there are a few hills. One of
							the highest is within three versts of the Walls. The Country is an open
							champain, without wood; without hedge, ditch, fence or Wall, the
							greatest part of the way.— The exceptions of fence, wall, and Wood, are
							occasional, and to a very small extent—the road runs the whole way very
							near the gulph of Finland, and at several places in sight of it. There
							was not an appearance of vegetation about half the way; but the latter
							half, the rye was two or three inches out of the ground, and caused a
							perceptible and pleasant verdure— From the day before yesterday Morning
							untill Noon the whole ground over which I passed was covered with Snow,
							which had fallen the preceding Night; but as I advanced, and after the
							sky cleared away it all disappeared— I saw scarcely any Cattle on the
							way— The principal cultivation of the Country is Rye, and there is
							little or no pasture or grazing land— Excepting the City of Narva, there
							is no other town on the Road— Very few Country Seats—not many
							comfortable houses— The Post-houses all belong to the Crown— Untill
							Narva they are large brick white plaistered houses, but standing for the
							most part alone, without even a village around them. They have no
							accommodations as inns; but you <pb n="97" type="ms"/>may obtain at most
							of them a dirty bed, and very good coffee, milk, cream and sugar. No
							wheat bread, and not always rye. The villages are scattered about, at
							the distance of three or four Versts from each other— They consist of
							twenty or thirty block-houses, scattered in spots without yard, fence or
							road before them; about twelve feet high, with thatched roofs; often
							without any chimney, and with the smoke issuing from a hollow passage
							between the eves of the roof, and the side of the house. They have more
							the appearance of barns than of dwelling houses— In some of the villages
							there is a small brick church with a low steeple; in most of them none.
							The peasants all wear the Russian dress—the Caftan and beard— The
							Post-masters all speak German; and have the German dress and Manners— I
							took as is customary a bag with 25 Rubles in Copper, to pay away in
							change upon the Road; which just lasted me to Reval— They have scarcely
							any small change upon the Road; but have small Cards, printed, which
							pass from Stage to Stage, for one Ruble, half or quarter of a Ruble
							according as they are marked— They pass however only at the Stages, and
							not in the City.</p>

							Just</persRef>—the German Translator <persRef ref="herklots-karl"
								>Herklots</persRef>, and the music by <persRef

							Ice has this day broken up and the harbour is clear— Captain Brinkman
							told me he expected to go on Sunday or Monday. He cannot venture to go

						<p><date>4. VI. </date>Employed the day, in writing and copying, for which

							disused it, that I find myself aukward at recommencing, and for the
							present save no time by it— Untill the hour of dinner, I left my writing
							desk only to breakfast and dress. At one O’Clock, <persRef
								ref="walther-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther</persRef>
							called upon me, and we went and dined at <persRef ref="u">Admiral
								Spiridoff’s</persRef>— There were about twenty persons at table;

								Benkendorf</persRef>, formerly Governor of Riga; and father to
								<persRef ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess Lieven</persRef>, wife of
							the <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Russian Ambassador in
								England</persRef>. They had got the new French Constitution as
							proposed by the Senate to the French People; and the proceedings of the
							provisional Government relative to the abdication of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</persRef>.— They were
							enchanted with the Address of the provisional Government to the French
							Nation, which is extremely well written— The <persRef ref="u">Admiral’s
								Lady</persRef>, and several children were there, and are a very
							agreeable family— I returned home about three; and wrote again untill

							for <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Adams</persRef>, to by the Post to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg this Evening— We afterwards
							went to the Theatre, which was decorated and illuminated— There was
							performed a Prologue written by <persRef ref="kotzbue-august"
								>Kotzebue</persRef>, and called Europe delivered— An Allegory—
							Europe a fair Lady was chained before a Pedestal on which stood an evil
							Genius, bearing a lighted torch in one hand, and an Air Balloon in the
							other— The Old Year came in, lamenting his condition and attended by
							War, Poverty, Famine, and Pestilence, whom he pointed out as they
							stalked successively across the Stage— But he announced that he was to
							be followed by his Brother who would restore all things— Then came
							another Fair Lady, representing Russia, who broke the chains of Europe;
							and at whose command the evil Genius vanished— The Scene changed,
							shewing a new world rising from the Ocean, with a rising Sun— After
							which appeared the New Year; with Peace, Plenty, Public Faith and
							Justice; concluding with a Chorus from <persRef ref="mozart-wolfgang"
								>Mozart’s</persRef> Opera of Titus, and in honour of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, whose Bust, crowned
							with laurel appeared at the back curtain of the Scene— The Opera of the
							Caliph of Bagdad was then performed— The Author, composer and
							translator, are the same as of Jean de Paris, and the plays too, are in
							substance the same—it is only a change of names and of incidents— The
							plot is absolutely the same. After the Play I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther to the Ball at the Merchants club.
							There were sixty or seventy Ladies, and about as many Men— They said it
							was very thinly attended, and that they often had at their Balls in the
							Winter, six hundred persons of both sexes— I met here a <pb n="98"
								type="ms"/><persRef ref="u">Lieutenant Barrett</persRef>, who
							introduced himself to me as an American, a native of Boston, and Son to
								<persRef ref="u">Deacon Barrett</persRef> of that place— He also
							introduced to me <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>, who is an
							Englishwoman, and his <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther appeared to pay little respect to
							him; and told me he believed him to be a Scotchman. I left the Ball room
							about one O’Clock in the morning, and after walking round to see the
							illuminations, retired to my lodgings— The Streets were as crowded with
							People, and as full of revelry as I had seen them on the Sunday Evening—
							This was the day of official rejoicing. The Te Deum, with the Cannonade
							was in the morning, and all the Holy Images of the City were carried
							round by the Priests in Procession.</p>

							the circle to be exactly 4 Versts or 2 2/3 Miles. There are seven Gates,
							at irregular distances from one another— An empty moat, and a Wall,
							flanked with Towers: The City is very old, and built in the Gothic
							Style. The Streets narrow and crooked— The buildings generally of brick;
							and plaistered, and a few of Stone. The Roofs of the Houses are of

							in employing it fully— I feel however the effect of continual Solitude;
							and the want of Society; especially in the after part of the day.—
							Finished reading the sixth, and began the seventh Book of <persRef
								ref="sully-maximilien">Sully’s</persRef> Memoirs.— The singular
							composition of <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry the fourth’s</persRef>
							character is exhibited here more distinctly than that of Sully himself—
							Sully tells his own Story— He shews only his own fair side— But he shews
							Henry on all sides— His vigilance, his intrepidity, his wonderful
							presence of mind, and coolness in the most imminent perils— His
							generous, affectionate, and humane temper; his cheerfulness and gaiety—
							His condescension and fascinating affability— His naturally choleric
							disposition, and the controul that he had acquired over that part of his
							infirmity, together with his ungovernable passion for the sex, and all
							the weaknesses, and all the follies into which it betrayed him— He tells
							a Story about the belle <persRef ref="destrees-gabrielle"
								>Gabrielle</persRef>, which shews her to have been a mere
							prostitute, and Henry, an egregious dupe; to such a degree as to
							acknowledge for his own a Child, to which he had no pretension— And this
							woman was the channel of the royal favours, and whoever was ambitious of
							serving the king found it necessary to pay assiduous court to her.— The
							character of the <persRef ref="delatourauvergne-henri2">Duke of
								Bouillon</persRef>, his insidious intrigues, and the imprudence of
							Henry, in being persuaded by him to declare War against Spain, form an
							interesting part of this narrative— The Treaty for the submission of the
								<persRef ref="henryofguise">Duke of Guise</persRef> another— The
							assassination of Henry by <persRef ref="chatel-jean">Jean
								Chatel</persRef>, under the instigation of the Jesuits, a third— The

						<p><date>8. V:30. </date>I went out at ten this Morning, with the intention
							of going to Church; that being the hour at which I was informed upon
							enquiry that the Service began. I met in the Street <persRef
								ref="rodde-diedrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde</persRef>,
							who accompanied me to the principal Lutheran Church— We were at least a
							full half hour too late, and found the Preacher, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer</persRef> in the midst of his
							Sermon.— There were about one hundred women present; and I believe not
							twenty men— The Clergyman read his discourse; after which— There were
							prayers for births and deaths, and banns of marriage published—the
							service closed with the singing of one Stanza of an hymn, accompanied by
							the organ— The Church is Gothic, built of Stone; the walls are lined
							with armouries—in a side chapel, separated by grated gates from the rest
							of the Church, there was a Bier and Coffin, apparently in state of
							preparation for a funeral. It was cold and damp—from the extent of the
							Church and the height of the Gothic arches, it was scarcely possible to
							hear the voice of the Preacher— There was nothing remarkable in his
							Oratory; but his delivery was very good. After Church I walked round the
							outside of the City—and as yesterday returned to the same gate in 47
							Minutes— When I came to my lodgings I found the Card of <persRef
								ref="uexkull-berend">Baron Uxkull</persRef> the Governor of
							Esthonia, who had paid me a visit and left a message inviting me to dine
							with him to-morrow— On my arrival here I intended to have paid him a
							visit, but was informed he was sick— One of the Captains of the fleet,
							with whom I dined at <persRef ref="u">Admiral Spiridoffs</persRef> also
							paid me a visit— I dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde’s— He
							has a <persRef ref="rodde-gertrud">Lady</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="rodde-marie;rodde-jenny;rodde-elisabeth;rodde-sophie">five
								daughters</persRef> and <persRef ref="rodde-alxander">one
								Son</persRef>— The <persRef ref="walther-charlotte">eldest
								daughter</persRef> is married to <persRef ref="walther-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walther</persRef> and they all live
							together— The second daughter is very pretty— There were at the dinner,
								<persRef ref="u">Baron Rosen</persRef>, an old Gentleman of 72 whom
							I had already met at Admiral Spiridoff’s; <persRef ref="u">Baron
								Dankelmann</persRef>, a native Prussian, now employed here at the
							Custom-house—A <persRef ref="u">Baron Stakelberg</persRef> a Land-Rath;
							or one of the twelve judges of the provincial tribunal; and <persRef
								ref="u">his Lady</persRef>, of the family of Igelström; a young and
							handsome woman—the Preacher whom we had heard at Church M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rodde’s partner <persRef ref="u">Riesenkampf</persRef>, and two or three
							others whom I did not know— The dinner was sumptuous and social— About 4
							in the afternoon I came home; and with a second walk towards Evening,
							spent the remainder of the day in writing, and reading <persRef
								ref="sully-maximilien">Sully</persRef>— Finished the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> and began the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> Book— There is a mixture of public and private History in
							these Memoirs, a talent at giving interest to the narrative, and the
							impression of resemblance to the characters; a soundness of moral and
							political principle a keenness of penetration and a solidity of judgment
							in the reflections upon persons and Events, which give them a charm
							beyond that of any novel I ever read— The account of his final and
							unsuccessful Negotiation with the <persRef ref="henry-iv"
								>king’s</persRef> Sister <persRef ref="catherinedebourbon"
								>Catherine</persRef>, to prevail upon her to marry the <persRef
								ref="henridebourbon">Duke of Montpensier</persRef>—of her violent
							sallies of Passion against him—of his cool, respectful, and inflexible
							defiance of her—his distress at the first hasty order given him by Henry
							to ask the Princess’s pardon; his triumph at the second letter from the
							King after receiving his report, and the address and management with
							which Catherine finally sought a reconcilement with him, are all
							painting to the life— His scene with the Astrologer, and the picture of
							the man are diverting; and the manner in which he finally enters the
							Council of Finance; the intrigues of the other members against him—
							Henry’s fluctuations about the measure of placing him there— The cunning
							of <persRef ref="denuefville-nicolas">Villeroi</persRef> in delaying the
							delivery of his Commission— Henry’s charge to <persRef
								ref="deberingden-pierre">Beringhen</persRef> to keep the Commission
							untill further order— His device afterwards, to throw the blame of its
							detention, upon the forgetfulness of the “gros Allemand” who had
							disclosed the secret to Sully, and who at last took upon himself all the
							blame of forgetfulness, are comical in the highest degree. The <persRef
								ref="destrees-gabrielle">Belle Gabrielle</persRef> still darkens the
							shade of Henry’s inexcusable vice— Her stratagem to get to the king,
							before Sully, when they were both sent for together; Sully’s dispatch to
							go with her—the dangerous accident they met with upon the road, and the
							agitation betrayed by the king on being informed of it, are all strong
							characteristic features. Yet perhaps this woman may claim some
							indulgence when it is considered that it was her advice which finally
							persuaded Henry, against all the Cabal of Sully’s rivals and enemies to
							place him at the head of the finances.— The Adventure with the Duke of
							Bouillon’s troop of horses, is one of those which shew the Spirit,
							firmness, and decision of Sully’s character— He speaks of Villeroi,
								<persRef ref="lavalette-jean">d’Epernon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jeannin-pierre">Jeannin</persRef>, and especially of <persRef
								ref="dossat-arnaud">Cardinal d’Ossat</persRef> in terms very much to
							their disadvantage— And he very directly charges d’Ossat, with having
							betrayed the interests of the king his Master, and the rights of the
							Gallican Church in the Negotiation with the <persRef ref="clement-viii"
								>Pope</persRef>, for Henry’s absolution. There was this Evening a
							new illumination of this City— A mere superabundance of joy.</p>

						<p><date>9. V:45. </date>This morning I returned the visit of <persRef
								ref="uexkull-berend">Baron Uxkull</persRef>, the Governor of the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde</persRef>, and several
							other Gentlemen, whose names I did not discover. There were two Card
							tables, and a Chess-Board set in a chamber adjoining the Dining Hall. I
							sat down with General Benkendorf, the Commandant of the City and a
							fourth hand to whist, while the dinner was serving up. We played one
							hand; then adjourned to dinner, and after that, and taking Coffee,
							returned to the Card-table— We played four rubbers and all retired
							between 4 and 5 in the afternoon— General Benkendorf, who is a great
							talker, and very pleasant companion told a number of anecdotes to the
							great diversion of the company. He told me that his daughter, <persRef
								ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess Lieven</persRef> wrote him that she
							liked the Country, in England, very well; but that the climate did not
							agree with her health, and that she found London excessively tiresome.—
							She had no Society; and her house was so small, and so crowded at her
							parties, that she was sure some of her Company never got beyond the
							Stairs. That they could not live upon the <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count’s</persRef> Salary, which is 32000
							ducats a year, and house-rent free; and that if they stayed there long,
							he would be ruined— That his State-Carriage cost him 17000 Rubles; and
							her box at the Opera, for four Months in the year 2500 Rubles— I went
							down to the Port and on board the vessel to enquire when the <persRef
								ref="u">Captain</persRef> thought of sailing— He was not there; but
							the Steersman said about Thursday; and to-morrow they would take my
							Carriage on Board— The North-west Wind has brought the Ice all back into
							the harbour. I walked round the City towards Evening, and read <persRef
								ref="sully-maximilien">Sully</persRef>; Books 7 and 8. He is now
							entering deeply into the Affairs of Finance, and shews how he detected
							and exposed the frauds and malversations of the Council—the
							establishment and suppression of a ridiculous Council of Reason; the
							reconciliation of the <persRef ref="charlesdelorraine">Duke of

							the French of <persRef ref="castelli-ignaz">Castelli</persRef>—the

							bad copy of Nina, which is a bad Original, and as <persRef

							8 and 9. Further details concerning the Finances, the infamous
							corruption and base intrigues of Messieurs du Conseil, and the baleful
							influence of the <persRef ref="henry-iv">king’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="destrees-gabrielle">Mistress</persRef>. It appears that
							the Edict of Nantes was extorted from the king, by the powerful
							combination of the Protestants, at the head of whom was the <persRef
								ref="delatourauvergne-henri2">Duke of Bouillon</persRef>— Sully’s
							zeal for the king urges him to an excess of disapprobation of these
							measures of the Protestants, and he acknowledges that they considered
							him as a deserter from the party— Sully’s Religion, and that of Henry
							himself were evidently matters of State-Policy— Sully advised his Master
							to change, and if he did not change, himself, it was merely because no
							motive of sufficient weight was presented to him, to overcome the pride
							of consistency, and the scruples of his conscience— If Henry was really
							sincere in his conversion; it is only a proof how subservient even the
							sincere opinions of a powerful Mind, may be made to worldly interests.
							The penances imposed upon Henry by the <persRef ref="clement-viii"
								>Pope</persRef>, as the price of his absolution are a burlesque upon
							Religion— He was to say so many Rosaries, and so many Chaplets, and so
							many Litanies every week; to hear Masses every day; to fast once a week,
							and go to confession at least four times a year— Was the Soul of Henry
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> capable of believing that an

							Employed the rest of the day in writing, and reading <persRef
								ref="sully-maximilien">Sully</persRef>—Books 9 and 10— The details
							of Finance become almost tedious, particularly, as they are in a great
							measure unintelligible— To understand them it would be necessary to be
							acquainted with the organization of the Department, and the official
							duties of the several Officers belonging to it— That it was a general
							Chaos of Confusion, in which nothing was systematic but fraud,
							peculation and plunder is obvious enough— The interests, the Passions
							and the influence against which Sully had to struggle, in effecting a
							reform are equally conspicuous; but the explanation of his means, and
							the detail of his measures I do not understand— The Character of
								<persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry</persRef> appears in all its weakness
							and all its strength, in his project to marry his <persRef
								ref="destrees-gabrielle">Mistress</persRef>, and in the deference

							insolent airs which he allows her to assume, at the baptism of her
								<persRef ref="debourbon-alexandre">second Son</persRef> by him, and
							in the Energy with which he supports Sully against her pretensions and
							her artifices— The Scene between them, in which she first reproaches him

							imploring mercy and forgiveness at his feet is delightful; and yet if
							this woman had not shortly after died, the king would in all probability

							Council Board is another incident in which the character of Sully
							displays itself advantageously; and the account of his own mode of life,

							instruction, and subjects for serious reflection— M<hi

									>r</hi> Rodde</persRef> came this Morning, and introduced to me
							a <persRef ref="u">General Norberg</persRef>, who asked me whether I had
							been about thirty-two years ago at Stockholm in company with an Italian
							nobleman named <persRef ref="u">Count Greco</persRef>. I said I had— He
							then asked if I recollected having then visited with the Count, and a
							Swedish Gentleman named <persRef ref="u">Wadström</persRef>, the cabinet
							of mechanical inventions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences— I answered
							that I did, perfectly well— He said he was then the keeper of that
							Cabinet, and had shewn it to us— His name and countenance were equally
							lost to my Memory; but after the name was brought back to it I had a
							faint remembrance of it— He had no more recollection of my person than I
							of his. He told me that he had now been for some years in the Russian
							Service—that he resided in the neighbourhood of this City, and he
							invited me to his house where he said if I still retained my fondness
							for the sight of mechanical inventions he could shew me some
							curiosities— He invited us to dine with him on Sunday; but as I had
							hopes of sailing by that day, I went out this afternoon with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde to the General’s House and returned
							his visit. It is about a Mile without the Walls— He shewed us several of
							his Inventions which are ingenious and useful. He is now engaged upon a
							great and costly work to enlarge and improve the Harbour of this place—
							Upon this there have already been expended a Million and a half of
							Rubles, and it will cost two Millions more to finish it— It is under the
							Superintendence of the Marine Department— But he seems not to be
							satisfied with the <persRef ref="detraversay-ivan">Marquis de
								Traversey</persRef>, and hopes <persRef ref="chichagov-pavel"
								>Admiral Tchichagoff</persRef> will come to the office again. He
							shewed us the drawings, and the models of his works, and several other
							of his inventions— A round table, contrived for the purpose of
							dispensing with the attendance of Servants— He thought if he had this in
							England he could make Money with it, but I believe not much. It appeared
							to me to have bestowed much labour and ingenuity to produce a small
							effect. It is merely a moveable circular leaf in the middle of the
							table, which by the machinery may be turned round so as to bring each
							dish, before each person at the table; and a shelf under the table, upon
							which plates may be stowed away— A bedstead for soldiers in Barracks,
							invented by <persRef ref="thompson-benjamin">Count Rumford</persRef>,
							and improved by the General— It may be used as a chair a table, or a
							working bench— An instrument for drawing in perspective— This the
							General said was not yet published; because <persRef ref="u"
								>Patterson</persRef> had taken with it, all his Views of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and he wished him to enjoy
							all the benefit of it— But he now intended to publish it shortly— A
							machine for raising Water, and circulating it through spiral tubes— A
							machine for scooping out the Staves of Barrels— A steam-vessel,
							navigable on the high-sea, a project which he said he had presented more
							than twenty-years ago to the <persRef ref="catherinethegreat">Empress
								Catherine</persRef>, to be used between S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Petersburg and Cronstadt— But it had not been approved— I
							told him of the privilege granted to <persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton</persRef>.— He said he had
							heard of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton’s Boats, which were a
							very admirable invention. After spending a couple of hours with him we
							returned to the City— I walked to the Castle Hill, and <pb n="102"
								type="ms"/>saw a quantity of ice floating in the harbour; which
							convinced me that I must not expect to sail before Monday, of so soon. I
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde this morning if there had
							been any misunderstanding between <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> and him— He said, not
							absolutely; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had not treated
							him well, and had been still more ungenerous towards <persRef
								ref="rodde-c">his brother</persRef>, formerly of Riga— They had both
							largely contributed to the making of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris’s Fortune— The House at Riga had paid him more than 150,000
							Rubles— His brother had agreed to pay M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris for the Vice-Consulate of Riga a pension of 1000 Alberts Dollars
							equal to 5000 Rubles a Year, and one half of all the profits which they
							made upon American Vessels and Cargoes— For the Vice-Consulate here, he
							had paid M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris 1000 Rubles a year, and
							also half the profits upon all the American business.— This could be
							done in 1809. 10. &amp; 11—but in 1812 and 13. There had been no
							American business to do— There came no American Vessels.— His brother’s
							house at Riga had been burnt, in the defence of the City— His sugar
							manufactory destroyed by the French invasion— The commercial house
							entirely broken up, and his brother had been forced to retire with a
							family of four children to subsist upon a small landed Estate in
							Finland— The House at Riga, had regularly advertised, called in and paid
							all their debts; but his brother was totally ruined, and he himself had
							lost 50000 Rubles of Capital which he had invested in the house— Yet
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris not only had demanded of his
							brother, 2000 Albert’s Dollars for his pension of the year’s 1812 and
							1813; but on his refusal to pay it, had charged it in account against
							him Diederich Rodde of Reval; had written him a Letter demanding payment
							of it, and had left a charge with <persRef ref="bruxner-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brüxner</persRef> to require it of
							him— He had also displaced him from the Consulate here, without
							assigning any reason— But when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							returned, he should ask an explanation of him, and if he did not give
							him satisfaction, he would print and publish a Statement of all Harris’s
							transactions with him, which would in no wise redound to his honour— He
							shewed me Harris’s letter to him dated 21. January last, and demanding
							payment of the 2000 Albert’s Dollars on Account of his Brother— He also
							shewed me his brother’s answer, upon the demands being communicated to
							him— Harris’s letter speaks of coming to Reval on his way to join
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>— But he did not come, because
							Rodde himself went to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg before
							Harris left it. The answer denies that Harris had any just demand upon
							the Riga house at all; and asserts that on the contrary Harris had
							received very large Sums of money from that house, of which they had a
							right to demand an account from him— That the House had advertised all
							claimants upon them to present their demands within six Months, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had not been heard from— And
							finally that if Harris has any demand upon him Rodde of Riga, he has
							only to address himself to him personally, and he shall receive a very
								<hi rend="italic">intelligible explanation</hi>. Harris did actually
							go to Rodde of Riga, at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and
							claimed the 2000 Albert’s Dollars— Rodde told him that he would arrange
							the matter with him in presence of another American; a fair, candid
								man—<persRef ref="u">Captain Bates</persRef>— He asked Harris in
							Bates’s presence to explain himself, and Harris told him he had no
							demand to make upon him at-all.— I now told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rodde that it had been reported to me that <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour</persRef> a partner of
							his house had very recently said at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg, that he had paid M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris in
							the year 1809. 38000 Rubles, for passing the Papers of a Counterfeit
							American Vessel; and I asked him if it was true— Rodde said that he
							relied upon it that I would receive in Confidence what he said to me,
							and would allow it to go no farther— It was true; and that was not the
								<hi rend="strikethrough">smallest</hi> largest sum paid— There was
							one Vessel that was obliged to pay 70000 Rubles.— That all the vessels
							in that predicament (with forged papers, pretended American) were
							obliged in the year 1809 to pay enormously— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harris did not keep all the money himself— He was the
							go-between— <persRef ref="u">Borel</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef> Neutral
							Commission had their share; but it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris’s certificate alone that settled the character of the ship’s
							Papers, and it was that which was paid for. Harris had received a great
							deal of money from the house of <persRef
								ref="krehmer-benedict;krehmer-sebastian">Cramer’s</persRef> at S<hi

								ref="catherine-i">Empress Catherine</persRef>— The House is Small,
							but the Gardens are extensive, and laid out in the fashionable style of

							red, which are said to have been laid by Peter himself. The rest of the
							house is plaistered— It is the usual residence of the <persRef
								ref="paulfriedrichaugustus">Prince of Oldenburg</persRef>, the
							Governor-General of these Provinces— But he is now absent. Round the
							Gardens there is a little village of Barracks for a Regiment of
							Soldiers; and on an hill beyond the Gardens stands the Light-house.
							There are five lamps placed in a chamber at the front of which is a door
							opening upon the gulph; and one lamp at the door itself. It is the
							highest Land in the neighbourhood of Reval, and a fine prospect of the
							City, the Harbour, the Gulf, and the Country around— We saw a small
							vessel coming into the Harbour—the first that has appeared this Season.
							The Harbour and the gulph beyond it is still covered with ice, but not
							in very large masses, and it appears that the gulph is navigable— We
							afterwards went to Charlottendal, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde’s
							Country seat, about three Versts on the other side of the City. He has a

							made his physician <persRef ref="lariviere-jean">La Riviére</persRef>
							cast his nativity. Another characteristic of the age, is Sully’s
							excessive pride of birth, and his profound contempt for every profession
							and occupation but that of arms— He argues the point as well as he can,
							and is evidently very sincere in his prejudices; but the prejudice
							betrays itself. Military renown, will in every Country and under every
							form of Government rise to the highest dignity, and give the greatest
							consideration— But in no civilized age or Nation can it ever engross the
							whole. The Administration of Justice must make the profession of the Law
							Respectable; and wealth always will command Consideration because it

							Went to Church alone, and heard the service performed and the Sermon in
							the Esthonian Language; which is altogether different both from the
							Russian and German.— The Church was not so large, as that of the
							Germans; but it was full, and even crowded—chiefly with persons from the
							Country— Peasants of both sexes— There was an alternation of Prayer’s,

							after the Sermon. At the Administration of the Communion I left the
							Church. <persRef ref="rodde-diedrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Company, with General Norberg’s <persRef ref="u;u">two Sons</persRef>,
							youths of about 14 or 15. We dined at his round table, without
							attendants— There was only one Servant who brought in the dishes, and
							put them on the table— But that Servant might have waited on the whole
							Company, and would have saved them the continual trouble of helping
							themselves— This table is a mere gimcrack— After dinner we made a party
							at whist untill five— The Commandant, Berg, invited me to dine with him
							the day after to-morrow if I should still be here. When I took leave of
							General Norberg he gave me several copies of a pamphlet which he has
							lately published, relative to some improvement of his invention, for the
							distillation of Brandy, which he asked me to distribute <pb n="104"
								type="ms"/>among his friends there, if I should meet with any who
							made enquiries after him— He wished to shew them what he was busied
							about— He gave me also one copy of another, a preceding pamphlet upon
							the same subject.— When I returned to my own lodgings, <persRef
								ref="gahlroos-axel">my Servant</persRef> told me that the Captain
							had been to desire that I would go on board the vessel this Evening; the
							wind being fair, and it being his intention to sail very early to-morrow
							Morning— I immediately finished the packing of my Clothes, books and

							Guardship, where they kept it together with that of the Vessel, telling

						<p><date>16. IV. </date>The wind this morning was fair though very light;
							and at four O’Clock we were ready to sail— It was however between seven
							and eight before the Officer from the Guard-ship came on board with the
							Vessel’s Pass and my Passport. He apologized to me for having made me
							wait so long, pretending not to have known that I was on board of this
							vessel, because my Passport did not mention the name of the Vessel in
							which I was to embark— After taking down in his register the name of the
							Vessel, and of the <persRef ref="u">Captain</persRef>, her burden,
							lading and where bound, he asked the Captain and me, saying he was
							obliged to do so, whether we had any Russian Money. I had none contrary
							to the intent of the Law— The Captain gave him a five Ruble Bill, with
							which he was well satisfied; and he left the Vessel, wishing us a good
							voyage— We sailed immediately; although the wind had died away almost to
							a total calm. There were seven other vessels lying with us at the mouth
							of the Harbour, ready to depart; but only one of them got under weigh— A
							Dutch vessel, freighted on the same account as ours, and the Captain of
							which had promised to sail in Company with ours. We had not even got
							outside of the harbour, before we saw in the Gulph, floating masses of
							ice, so large, and so close together that the Captain was apprehensive
							he should be obliged to return. But there was no wind, untill towards
							evening when a light breeze sprung up, from the North-west, as directly
							a-head as it could blow. Notwithstanding the difficulty of beating
							against a head-wind amidst the floating ice, the Captain at my desire
							and that of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zandelin</persRef>, made the attempt to reach Baltic-Port, about 20
							Miles distant from Reval, but without success. The weather was fine, but
							so cold that it was impossible for me to write a line the whole day. I
							read <persRef ref="sully-maximilien">Sully</persRef>, Books 13. 14. and
							15. the most interesting parts of which are the details of his Embassy
							to England, on the accession of <persRef ref="james-i">James
							1</persRef>. immediately after the Death of <persRef ref="elizabeth-i"
								>Queen Elizabeth</persRef>; and his Negotiations with James and his
							Ministers. Sully, with all his great and good qualities was a man of
							harsh and severe character— He speaks ill of almost every body, and
							scarcely ever well of any one; excepting <persRef ref="henry-iv">king
								Henry</persRef> and Queen Elizabeth.— In his English Negotiations he
							is extremely bitter against the English Nation in general; and most
							especially so against James’s Minister of State <persRef
								ref="cecil-william">Cecil</persRef>, a name much respected in
							English History— Sully is not much more favorable to <persRef
								ref="vanoldenbarnevelt-johan">Barneveld</persRef>, who was then in
							London at the Head of a Deputation from the States-General, and in
							pursuit of the same object as Sully. He represents himself as having
							been completely successful with James, against the advice of Cabals of
							Cecil, and all the English Ministry, but he admits that he could not
							avail himself so advantageously of this success as he might have done,
							for want of a Carte-blanche signed by Henry, upon which he could have
							concluded a Treaty with James— He touches very lightly upon a gross
							insult which he received from an English Admiral, as he was crossing the
							channel, on account of the flag, and on the piracies of the English
							against which it was one of the objects, of his mission to complain. He
							had with him a suite of 300 persons, and immediately after his arrival
							in London was obliged to try and condemn to death one of them for a
							Murder— He delivered him over for Execution to the <persRef
								ref="bennett-thomas2">Lord Mayor of London</persRef>, but the <pb
								n="105" type="ms"/>sentence was not executed. He gives the character
							of a young Man of his Suite named <persRef ref="u">Servin</persRef>, a
							most extraordinary compound of personal accomplishments and detestable
							vices— And he makes the conduct of the Spanish Ambassador <persRef
								ref="deligne-charles">Count d’Aremberg</persRef> appear supremely

								ref="debalzac-catherine">Mistress</persRef>, are related with
							candour, and form a picture which excites alternate indignation and

							forbore to have the Sentence executed, but pardoned her, and submitted
							to the Conditions which she required with regard to the others. But the
							passion for the sex was not Henry’s only vice— He was addicted to
							gaming; and his hunting expences were extravagant— Altogether, Sully
							states that the sums he squandered upon his pleasure would have
							maintained an army of 15000 men. The treachery of one of <persRef

							Treaty he concluded with Spain— The Treaty of Commerce between France
							and Spain which was concluded by Sully himself shortly afterwards, and

							ice-fields. We spoke with two Vessels; one four days from Stockholm, and
							bound to Reval— The other an English vessel, from which they told us
							that they had met the ice, as far South as 60 Miles beyond Dagerort— I
							took my thermometer on deck to ascertain the temperature of the
							atmosphere— It was 1 1/2 degrees of <persRef ref="reaumur-rene"
								>Reaumur</persRef> above 0— In the Cabin it is steady between 4 and
							5— I walked three times in the day; about an hour each time, to warm my
							fingers sufficiently to write— But it grows every day more irksome— I
							read <persRef ref="sully-maximilien">Sully</persRef>, Books 25 and 26,
							in which there are many of the details concerning the internal
							Government of France, which I do not understand, and which are therefore
							rather tedious than amusing.— It is much to the Honour of Sully, that he
							resisted all the <persRef ref="henry-iv">kings</persRef> offers to
							aggrandize him and his family, upon Condition that he and <persRef
								ref="debethune-francois2">his son</persRef> should change their
							religion— Here is the first notice of Henry’s last Passion for <persRef
								ref="demontmorency-charlotte">Mademoiselle de Montmorency</persRef>,
							whom he married to the <persRef ref="henriofconde">Prince of
								Condé</persRef>— The domestic quarrels with the <persRef
								ref="demedici-marie">queen</persRef>, still continue to occupy much
							of the narrative—and Sully complains still of the king’s gambling
							habits, and prodigalities— A remarkable circumstance is the publicity
							with which Henry kept his Mistresses, four of whom it is said had
							formally and successively that title. He had eight children by them, who
							were all legitimated; and for whom Henry’s affection, as well as for his
							lawful children is one of the most amiable features in his
							character.</p>

							I saw this day no ice. The <persRef ref="u">Captain</persRef> says
							however that it was to be seen at the Southward. Twice in the course of
							the day, I saw the Rocks on the Coast of Finland— They are innumerable;
							and many of them do not appear above water— There is one place laid down
							on the Charts, and from which we are not far distant <pb n="107"
								type="ms"/>where the compass entirely fails; the needle pointing
							irregularly to every quarter of the sky. This effect is supposed to
							proceed from great masses of iron, among the rocks under the water. I
							wrote less this than any of the preceding days the continual cold,
							making it almost impossible— Read <persRef ref="sully-maximilien"
								>Sully</persRef>, Books 26 and 27. the latter closing with the fatal
							Catastrophe, the murder of the <persRef ref="henry-iv">king</persRef>.
							He was on the point of commencing the greatest War in which he had ever
							been engaged, a War, for which he and Sully had been many years making
							every possible preparation; but the issue of which would have been very
							uncertain; and of the Justice of which I am not convinced— In the affair
							of the <persRef ref="henriofconde;demontmorency-charlotte">Prince and
								Princess of Condé</persRef> Henry was so grossly and outrageously
							wrong, that I feel some indignation at <persRef ref="sully-maximilien"
								>Sully’s</persRef> attempt to throw much of the blame upon the
							Prince. I see nothing in his conduct which was not justified by the
							necessity of the case, and nothing in that of Henry on this occasion,
							which deserves any other sentiment than contempt and detestation. The
							presentiments and prognostications of Henry’s death shew very strongly
							the character of the age, and in some degree the weakness of the man.
							His reluctance at the Coronation of the <persRef ref="demedici-marie"
								>Queen</persRef>, appears to have arisen altogether from
							Superstition— But the act of <persRef ref="ravaillac-francois"
								>Ravaillac</persRef> had no connection with the Coronation, and
							would doubtless have been committed, in the same manner, if that
							Ceremony had not taken place. Ravaillac was a fanatic, and had probably
							no accomplices.</p>

							that he needed not to have told me; for I had seen it in his face, the

							the light-house on the Island of Utö, which is the entrance to go to

						<p><date>25. V. </date>About five this Morning, the Rocks on the Coast of
							Sweden were first seen, and soon afterwards the two light-houses on the
							Rocks of Grunskär, and Korssö which are at the entrance of the Harbour—
							They were then distant about 20 marine Miles. At nine we had nearly come
							up with them, and a Pilot came on board who took the vessel into
							Sandhamn, the first harbour; formed by the island of Sandöe, where there
							is a Custom-house and ten or twelve Pilot’s huts. We got in there about
							ten; and while the Custom-house Officers came on board, instead of
							coming to Anchor the vessel was fastened by a small Cable carried to the
							shore— The <persRef ref="u">Captain</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zandelin</persRef> went on shore with
							the Papers of the Vessel and Cargo— The Officers of the Customs came on

							my Passport. It was half-past twelve at Noon, when we got under sail
							again, and just as we parted from the Rock, one of the Vessels which
							sailed from Reval with us, came to it. We had a second Pilot who took us
							up to Stockholm— The passage is of about 40 Marine Miles, very narrow,
							and winding, between a Multitude almost numberless of Rocks, many of
							them bare, and others covered with firs, and other ever-greens— About
							fifteen marine Miles, below Stockholm, is the antient Castle of
							Friedrichsberg, of which no use is now made; and the modern one of
							Waxholm, where there is a guard stationed, and where the ship’s papers,
							and my Passport were sent on shore to be inspected. Just before coming
							to this Castle, at a place where the channel winds between the Rocks,
							the passage, made by nature very narrow, has been still more straitened,
							by two old ships of the line sunk purposely to obstruct it— This, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Zandelin told me was done about three
							years ago, when they were at War with England; from the fear of a visit
							to Stockholm by a British fleet. It has made the place all but
							impassible— We anchored about 7 in the Evening in the Harbour of
							Stockholm; and I very soon afterwards came on shore— I took a lodging at
							the English Tavern, kept by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Johnson</persRef>; and found there an American, a
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Fairfield</persRef>, with whom I went
							immediately to <persRef ref="speyer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Speyer’s</persRef> lodgings; not finding him at home I went to those

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s <persRef ref="russell-george"
								>Son</persRef>, a boy of about twelve years of age— I sat with them,
							untill 11 O’Clock, and received from him information of many
							Circumstances, and much American news— The most important of which was
							the appointment of <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> as a member of the
