						<p><date>1. VI. </date>My Journal having run several of the last days, in
							arrear, I employed all the time I had this morning, in the endeavour to
							retrieve them— I had begun yesterday Morning, but the accounts of our
							late Mission Meetings, takes the leisure of several days—at half-past
							ten this morning, we had our meeting previous to proceeding to the
							Conference with the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>. <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had prepared a
							minute of the alterations and amendments which we wish to obtain to the
							British project, and an Article for restoring the British right to
							navigate the Mississippi, and our right to the fisheries within the
							British Jurisdiction— This minute and Article were to be left with the
							British Plenipotentiaries— <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">We</persRef> agreed
							upon the mode in which we should proceed in the Conference; and at
							twelve O’Clock went to their house— As soon as we were seated at the
							Table, Lord Gambier said he was happy that we had now met again, and
							that it was with much fairer prospects of success than when we had met
							last. That as we had left to them the option of the place of meeting
							they had proposed their own house, supposing it equally agreeable to us.
							We had really thought it no mark of civility in them to name their own
							house; nor was it even conformable to our agreement at the commencement
							of the Negotiation, which was that we should meet alternately at the
							houses of each other.— Our last conference had been at their house, and
							regularly this should have been at ours. Of this however we took no
							notice, and I declared our hearty concurrence in the sentiment of
							satisfaction expressed by Lord Gambier, at the improvement in the
							prospects of a successful termination to the Negotiation, since our last
							meeting.— I then observed that in our Note of Yesterday we had stated
							the motives upon which we had requested the present Conference. That we
							had agreed to many of the alterations proposed by them to the project of
							a Treaty which we had sent to them— That we had consented to wave the
							Articles to which they had objected, with the exception of part of one
							of them which we still wished to discuss, and with respect to which we
							had enclosed to them a provision made by an act of Congress at the
							commencement of the War. There were some of the alterations proposed by
							them, however, to which we could not agree; we wished to obtain
							explanations concerning some others, and also to fill the blanks of
							times and places, in several of the Articles— The mode of proceeding
							which we had thought it would be proper to adopt, was to take the Projet
							and refer in regular order to the passages to which we objected, stating
							successively the grounds of our objections. This was accordingly done.—
							The first objection we made was to an alteration in the first article
							respecting the restoration of territory, places and possessions taken
							during the War; our project had made it universal, without exception—
							The British proposed alteration was to <pb n="175" type="ms"/>limit the
							restoration to territories, <hi rend="italic">belonging to</hi> one
							party, and taken by the other— I stated that our objection to the
							alteration was that it made one party the judge whether any territory
							taken by it did or did not belong to the other— It would enable either
							party to refuse giving up at its option any portion of the possessions
							of the other, taken by it, merely by saying this does not belong to you.
							It was contrary to the tenour of the Articles by which a provision was
							made for settling all the questions of disputed boundary, and contrary
							to the general basis which had been agreed to, of the State before the
							War, substituting instead of it, present possession, upon which we had
							declined to treat, and which they had explicitly abandoned— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams insisted upon retaining the alteration— Goulburn said
							that he did not know of any part of the territory taken by either party,
							which it could hold as not belonging to the other, except the islands in
							the Bay of Fundy, which as we had written to our Government, one of them
							had said they considered as belonging to Great-Britain as clearly as
							Northamptonshire— That there could be no reason for restoring that which
							must ultimately be adjudged to them; and if it should finally prove
							otherwise the possession could not be long retained as in the next
							Article the final decision of the disputed question was provided for—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that our objection was
							that the alteration instead of settling disputes only laid the
							foundation for a new one— Suppose the Treaty concluded— Each party will
							immediately demand the delivery of possession of the places taken from
							it.— The other refuses to deliver this or that place and says this does
							not belong to you— A new dispute is thus started upon the very execution
							of the Treaty. Nor did it apply merely to the case of Moose Island—
							There were several Islands in the River, and Lakes in the same
							predicament— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said he did not
							know that any of the Islands in the River or Lakes had been taken by
							either party from the other during the War— I observed that as to the
							question of right our opinions and their’s would of course not be the
							same; and in ours the island of Grand Menan in the Bay of Fundy, a
							larger and more valuable Island than those they so confidently claimed,
							was as much ours as the City of New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn said that the mass of Evidence they had upon the subject was
							immensely voluminous; that he had been prepared at one time to enter
							upon the discussion of the question, but there would be no use now in
							battling it, upon points for which another mode of settlement was agreed
							upon— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said that the objection to
							the alteration was one which might be applied to every stipulation of
							every Treaty— It was not to be presumed that a Government agreeing to a
							stipulation, would not carry it into effect with good faith— That he did
							not see that the retaining possession of what belonged to them came at
							all within the principle of uti possidetis— That the Status ante Bellum
							could mean only the State as of right, and that the restoration of
							possession to be required could only be of rightful possession— I said
							that possession was in its nature matter of fact, and not of right— That
							when therefore the restoration of possession was to be stipulated, the
							State before the War, was mere matter of fact— The right of course would
							remain the same as before the War without stipulation; and if possession
							taken during the War was retained, it could only be on the principle of
							uti possidetis, and not on that of Status ante bellum. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said it was not necessary to
							suppose bad faith or a disposition to elude the execution of the Treaty
							on either side— The alteration would give rise to a new dispute, with
							the utmost fidelity and sincerity on both sides— One party claims the
							delivery of territory taken from it, and which it sincerely and honestly
							believes to belong to it— The other refuses to deliver it, believing
							with equal sincerity and confidence that it belongs to itself— Here is
							immediately a new dispute— Suppose the case that the place belongs to
							neither of the parties— Suppose the case that it belongs to both— On
							either of these suppositions you have immediately a new dispute— The
							restoration to the state existing before the War, is a plain and simple
							principle; a matter of fact about which no dispute can arise— No reply
							was made to these remarks, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							afterwards told me he made, with particular reference to the Settlement
							on Columbia river— But as the British Plenipotentiaries manifested no
							sign of yielding, I proposed to pass on to the next Article.— This
							related to the periods fixed for the cessation of hostilities, and the
							restoration of prizes taken at sea— We had in our original project
							followed in form the precedents of the Treaty of Peace in 1782, but had
							assumed the signature of the Treaty as the date from which the terms for
							the cessation of hostilities in the different Latitudes, were to
							commence— They had substituted the Exchange of the <pb n="176" type="ms"
							/>Ratifications as the date, and we had agreed to this Alteration. We
							had agreed in our own meetings to propose to shorten the periods for the
							cessation of hostilities— I observed that I hoped we should finally
							agree upon a Treaty, of the Ratification of which there would be no
							doubt; so that it might be considered as a mere formality— The Peace
							would then be made, six weeks or two Months before it could be ratified—
							We wished that no time might be lost and we had therefore shortened all
							the terms—that of the Channel and the North Seas, particularly within a
							period even shorter than might be necessary for the exchange of the
							Ratifications to be known— The conclusion of the Treaty would however be
							known, and we supposed it might be more for the Advantage of
							Great-Britain than for that of the United-States that the period of
							hostilities should be abridged in this quarter— They said that whenever
							the Advantage might be, the orders to the commanders of ships and other
							officers could not be issued until the Exchange of the Ratifications was
							known— The Ratification of the Treaty would indeed be in England a mere
							formality, for they had authority to bind their Government, their
							full-power promising to ratify what they should do— They hoped there
							would be no doubt of an immediate ratification in America; but our
							full-power did not positively promise it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin said it could not, because the Ratification of Treaties was by
							our Constitution reserved to the President, and the Senate; and required
							the consent of two thirds of the latter. We finally took the Article
							which they had drawn up on this subject, my Colleagues observing that we
							should perhaps on examination find it preferable to our own— The next
							Articles were those stipulating the appointment of Commissioners to
							ascertain and settle the boundary lines— We had proposed the appointment
							of three sets of three Commissioners, following exactly the precedent of
							those for ascertaining the S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Croix River,
							in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay’s Treaty— The British project,
							proposes only two Commissioners, and if they, one being appointed by
							each Government should not agree, then to leave the decision to a
							friendly Sovereign— We agreed to this alteration— They had however drawn
							an entire new Article in lieu of our third; and they had begun with a
							quotation from the Treaty of Peace of 1783—the quotation was incomplete,
							and presented no distinct Sense— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn
							observed that there had been an omission of one line in the copy sent
							us; and Lord Gambier said he had observed it in making out his copy of
							the project— I had also observed it, and we were prepared to supply the
							omission which was done— But the British project had included in the
							description of the disputed boundary only certain Islands in the Bay of
							Fundy, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thought was
							intended to exclude from the judgment of the Commissioners Moose Island;
							that being not in the Bay of Fundy, but in the Bay of Passamaquoddy; and
							connected with the determination to restore only the territory belonging
							to us, he supposed was meant not only to keep possession of
							Moose-Island, but to place it without the powers of the Commissioners to
							decide upon the title to it— The British Plenipotentiaries however
							immediately agreed to the Alteration proposed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin, including the islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy,
							and that of Grand Menan in the Bay of Fundy.— This removed one of the
							great remaining obstacles to the Peace— Then came the question about
							filling the Blanks of the places where the Commissioners were to meet in
							the first instance— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said they
							had thought of filling two of the Blanks with places in the British
							dominions, and two within the United States— They mentioned S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Johns for the third Article and Montreal
							for the fourth— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Andrews in the province of New Brunswick
							for both; as being the spot nearest and most convenient to the scene of
							operations— It was agreed to be inserted Lord Gambier remarking that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin by his local knowledge of
							that Country knew best what was the fittest place; and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams asking whether S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Andrews was a considerable place.— The
							blank in the fifth Article was filled with Albany— The eighth Article
							was that on which there will be the greatest obstacles in coming to an
							ultimate agreement— It is the boundary west from the Lake of the Woods—
							In the course of the Correspondence the British Plenipotentiaries had
							proposed the line of <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> King’s</persRef> unratified Convention of 1803. The
							shortest line from the Lake to the Mississippi. We had proposed a line
							agreed to in the proposed Convention of 1807. between Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef key="monroe-james">Monroe</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">Pinkney</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="eden-william2">Lords Aukland</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fox-henry">Holland</persRef>— The British Government now
							propose a line due west in the 49<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							parallel of Latitudes with an additional clause that the British shall
							have the free Navigation of the Mississippi, and free access to it
							through our territories generally with their goods, wares and
							merchandize— I observed that we proposed to strike out this clause— That
							it consisted of two parts—first the <pb n="177" type="ms"/>navigation of
							the river for His Britannic Majesty’s Subjects, and secondly the access
							to it for them through out territories. With regard to the first, the
							right was stipulated for British Subjects by the Treaty of Peace of
							1783. we had stated in our Note sent with our project, that we
							considered that Treaty of 1783 as bearing a peculiar character, and that
							it was not liable like ordinary Treaties to be abrogated by a subsequent
							War— That the American Government had considered the rights and
							liberties secured by it to the people of the United States, as requiring
							no new and additional stipulation; and had therefore not authorized us
							to bring them into discussion— To this part of our Note; the British
							Plenipotentiaries had made no reply— We knew not whether their silence
							was owing to the acquiescence of their Government in the principle we
							had advanced, or to some other cause. . . Lord Gambier said No . . . No.
							But, continued I, the British right to navigate the Mississippi, stands
							on the same foundation, the Peace of 1783. We admit that if our
							principle is good to us for the fisheries within British Jurisdiction;
							it is good for the British right to navigate the Mississippi within our
							Jurisdiction— If the British Government so considers them there is no
							need of a new stipulation in either case— But by asking a new one for
							the Mississippi, it was to be inferred that Great-Britain considered the
							rights on both sides to be forfeited by the War, and she now asked a new
							right to navigate the Mississippi, without offering for it any
							equivalent.— If a new engagement was necessary for one of the privileges
							it was necessary for the other; and we had prepared an article which we
							would leave with them, to restore both.— As to their access to the
							Mississippi through our territories; if the right to navigate the river
							was granted, access to it by one road must be allowed; but it would
							obviously necessary to guard it by a provision for the collection of
							duties; and if a general access without limitation of place was to be
							granted, we thought a reciprocal right would be necessary for the People
							of the United States through the British Territories, to the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Lawrence; and the free Navigation of that
							river— This observation that they were asking for a new right, without
							offering an equivalent, appeared to take the British Plenipotentiaries
							altogether by surprize— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin told
							them that if they considered the remainder of the Article, the 49<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> parallel of Latitude as an equivalent,
							we wished them to understand that we attached no importance to it
							at-all— It would indeed be a convenience to have the boundary settled—
							But the Lands there were of so little value, and the period when they
							might be settled was so remote, that we were perfectly willing that the
							boundary there should remain as it now is, and without any further
							arrangement— If it was agreeable to them we had no sort of objection to
							striking out the whole of the eighth Article— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goulburn said that as by agreeing to the West line in the
							Latitude of 49. they gave up all claim to <hi rend="strikethrough">the
								Navigation of the Mississippi</hi> any possessions on the
							Mississippi, it was necessary to stipulate for the right of Navigation
							on the river, and for access to it through our territories— It was of no
							use to them at present, but it might eventually be of some advantage to
							them— It was a provision for futurity rather than for the present time—
							I said that whatever it might be, it was a privilege to which their
							Government appeared to attach considerable importance, and they could
							not expect it would be granted by the United States without an
							equivalent— Goulburn said they had no authority to agree to our Article;
							and they must refer it to their Government— The whole Treaty must be
							taken together, and the equivalent must be found in the concessions of
							Great-Britain in the other Articles— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Adams expressed the same idea, and Lord Gambier said yes . . . yes . . .
							yes. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin told them, that there was
							no concession of Great-Britain in any of the other Articles— We had
							insisted upon the mutual restoration of Territory, and had invariably
							declined treating on any other basis— We should by that only get back
							our own; and we should restore to Great Britain what was hers— As to all
							the Articles for the settlement of Boundary, they might be mutually
							useful; but we had no particular interest in them— We had accepted the
							mode of settlement proposed by Great-Britain, instead of our own, and we
							were quite willing if she desired it to strike out every one of those
							articles. But we could not admit this unexpected claim without some
							equivalent. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said they had
							informed us in their first Note that the claim would be made— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin replied they had— But that in
							their Note of 21<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> September to which we
							had since been expressly referred by them as containing <hi
								rend="italic">the whole</hi> of their demands it was not mentioned.—
							We now passed to the Article concerning indemnities— I remarked that we
							had consented to wave all claims for them that have arisen subsequent to
							the commencement of the War; excepting for Vessels which had been in
							British Ports when the War <pb n="178" type="ms"/>commenced, and had
							been there seized— We had sent them a copy of a Section of an Act of
							Congress, passed immediately after the declaration of War, allowing
							British Vessels then in the Ports of the United States six Months to
							depart; and our Instructions authorised us to say that the permission
							had been extended in the execution of the Law, even beyond the time
							limited by its Letter— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn have but a feeble controul of
							their temper. Adams began by an argument, as if he had been in Doctor’s
							commons— He said that he had examined the Section of the Law we had
							sent, and it appeared to him not to <hi rend="italic">make out a
								case</hi> for a claim near so strong as our Note had stated it— That
							it only gave authority to the President to give Passports to British
							Vessels to depart— Why this was no more than what the King had power to
							do, in England, at-all times— That America had declared War against
							England, and of course all American Vessels in the English Ports had
							been seized— At first they had only laid the hand upon them, and kept
							them sequestered until it was seen what was the result of the proposals
							made for Peace, by <persRef ref="warren-john2">Admiral Warren</persRef>—
							Afterwards they were all condemned, and a claim for indemnities for them
							was not only without foundation, but utterly unprecedented among
							Nations. I replied that it was not merely the Law, but the execution of
							the Law, and the extension of the indulgence granted by it even beyond
							the time expressed in it, which we considered as warranting a claim to a
							similar liberality on the part of Great-Britain. That so far from its
							being unprecedented, we considered it as the common custom of Nations; I
							had not at hand any of the writers on the Law of Nations, but I felt the
							utmost confidence that the principle was sanctioned by them— That there
							was scarcely a Treaty between commercial Nations in modern times that
							did not contain it as a stipulation, and it was generally viewed as a
							stipulation merely in affirmance of the acknowledged principle— That
							with regard to the manner of carrying on a War neither the Law not the
							usages of Nations recognized any distinction of right, founded on the
							declaration of War, whether made by the one party or the other— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams insisted that there was a material
							difference in the consideration which party declared the War, and
							renewed the assertion that a demand for indemnity on such a ground was
							utterly unprecedented— That when war was declared by one party, its
							ships in the Ports of the other were of course seized— They were
							sometimes kept until it was seen whether peace would be restored, and if
							not they were condemned; and if the other party did otherwise, it
							mattered not whether from liberality or any other motive, it gave no
							claim whatsoever either for indemnity or for restoration— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said that he remembered having
							received at the time a Letter from one of his friends in Liverpool
							informing him that he had seized an American vessel there— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin asked what was done with such
							vessels when they were condemned— Whether they were considered as droits
							of the Admiralty or given to the seizors— Goulburn and Adams said a
							portion of them was given to the seizor— Both of them appeared to be
							nettled at the question— Goulburn said that it would be humiliating and
							disgraceful in Great-Britain to allow any such claim for indemnity. That
							it was requiring her to pay a shameful <hi rend="italic">tribute</hi>
							for Peace— That it had been demanded France in the War of 1756. and
							refused— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin said that was for
							vessels taken at sea, before the War was declared— Goulburn said it was
							demanded by France in the last War; and had been the pretext upon which
							the English prisoners in France when the War commenced had been detained
							as prisoners— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said, looking
							earnestly at Goulburn, has it not been considered throughout Europe that
							this measure of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>
							was not only extremely harsh in its character but unquestionably in
							violation of the Law of Nations? Goulburn hesitatingly said, yes, but it
							was done on the pretence of retaliation for our detention of French
							property— Thus said I our claim in the present instance is at least not
							unprecedented— Ay—said Goulburn with a coarse and insulting tone; but we
							do not admit Bonaparte’s construction of the Law of Nations.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin afterwards told me that his
							object in asking the last question was to obtain an admission from them
							that the detention of the British in France was in violation of the Law
							of Nations, because the principle applied to their own conduct in
							detaining as prisoners the American Seamen they had impressed before the
							War— We had now gone through the topics on which we had asked the
							conference, and recurred to the points upon which we had not agreed—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin mentioned the Mississippi
							and the fisheries and gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn the
							Article he had prepared for restoring them— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard said there was also the Restoration of . . . <pb
								n="179" type="ms"/> . . . D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams,
							thinking that he meant the Restoration of the ships, or <hi
								rend="italic">property afloat</hi>, which they had said was liable
							to immediate seizure on the breaking out of a War, while they admitted
							that by the usage of Nations in modern times, all other property was
							respected, did not give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard time to
							finish his sentence— No! as to that, said he, we shall not refer it to
							our Government . . . we reject it at once— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard said he had meant the Restoration of Territory—
							Oh!—aye!—ah! said Adams; yes we can refer that. . . We may as well refer
							it, said Goulburn, as we must refer the other—but, Gentlemen; we cannot
							say that our Government will not require something else. . . We had
							hoped we could have concluded without referring again to our Government—
							We mean to say, that we were now authorised to sign the Treaty, as we
							sent it to you. . . We made no question, said M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Clay, that you would sign the Treaty, if we agreed to it in
							your own terms. . . Yes, said Goulburn, very aukwardly; but we only
							regret the <hi rend="italic">delay</hi>, and should have wished to have
							concluded now— We wish the delay may not be imputed to us. . . As we
							rose to take leave D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams expressed a
							wish that what had passed between us might be kept at present entirely
							secret; and that if we should sign a Treaty it should be not mentioned
							or disclosed to any person for at least twenty-four hours, that their
							messenger might have a start of that time, to carry the first news to
							the Government— He said there was so much commercial speculation upon
							our transactions that it was very desirable nothing should be said by
							any of us to give advantages to any person— Because you know, said he,
							one does not know to whom it might be attributed— We assented to these
							observations; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard afterwards said
							he thought they were very indelicate— Perhaps they were; but after
								<persRef ref="milligan-george">Milligan’s</persRef> expedition to
							England in August, and the circumstances attending it, I thought them
							quite excusable.— We returned home about three O’Clock, and I wrote
							until dinner time, and again all the Evening.</p>

									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— When we received last Sunday the
							Note from the <persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, with their proposals and
							alterations of our Projet, it became probable that we should ultimately
							sign a Treaty of Peace— <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> then proposed that
							we should henceforth keep the State of the negotiation exclusively to
							ourselves, and communicate the papers to no person whatsoever excepting
							our Secretary <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hughes</persRef>. This was agreed to by us all.—
							Nevertheless, <persRef ref="bentzon-adrian">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bentzon</persRef> went off the next morning for London,
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howland</persRef>
							for Havre. Bentzon called upon me, about eight o’clock of the morning of
							his departure, and was as inquisitive about the State of the Negotiation
							as he could indirectly be. With <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> he was more direct
							in his enquiries— Bentzon’s father in Law, <persRef ref="astor-john"
								>John Jacob Astor</persRef> of New-York, had before the War, made a
							settlement at the mouth of Columbia River on the pacific Ocean. A
							British Sloop of War; the Raccoon had during the War, broken it up—
							Bentzon stated to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin that Astor had
							a ship at Canton in China. That if Peace should be made, the instant it
							is signed, Astor intends to dispatch an order from England, without
							waiting for the ratification in America, to the ship at Canton to
							proceed immediately to Columbia river, and renew the settlement there,
							before the British will have time to anticipate him— Bentzon supposed
							that there was a public interest connected with this project important
							enough to induce us to communicate to him the state of the Negotiation
							and the prospects of Peace. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							observed to him that he must in that case communicate his proposals in
							writing, and we would deliberate upon them— Bentzon drew up a paper and
							gave it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, with Liberty to shew
							it to me; and perhaps to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>; but not to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell; of course we could neither deliberate upon it, nor
							give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentzon the information he desired—
							He told me this morning, that he must go to London, where he expected
							the frigate would be ready to sail for the West-Indies, on the first of
							December— He is one of the Danish Commissioners appointed to receive
							delivery of the Danish Islands from the British— He said he had
							yesterday received information from Paris, that his colleague had
							already left that City for London; which made it necessary for him to
							hasten his departure— But if he should not find the frigate there, we
							should have him back here again. I gave him a packet of Letters for
								<persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef>— Howland went off very suddenly; and we know that
							he was here with views of speculation— Shaler became so inquisitive to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, upon the state of the
							Negotiation, that Russell at last told him we had laid ourselves under
							an injunction of secrecy concerning it. Shaler took offence at this as a
							manifestation that he had lost our confidence, and the next day,
							informed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, that he wished to return immediately
							to Paris, and to the United States in the Transit— He complained much
							about the loss of our confidence, and asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell who it was that had proposed the injunction of
							secrecy— Russell told him that was a part of the secret. We have agreed
							however to ask that Shaler’s Passport from the British Admiralty to go
							by the Neptune, may be transferred for the transit. <pb n="180"
								type="ms"/>He did not chuse to go by the Herald, and was unwilling
							to lose his opportunity of going by the Neptune— This morning Shaler
							came and took leave of me. I wrote and copied a short Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford from the Mission— I also wrote to
								<persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boyd</persRef>— Called at Shaler’s lodgings and gave him the Letter—
							Walked round the Ramparts and Coupure— Went to the Theatre in the
							Evening and saw Timour the Tartar, and the Bee-hive or Industry will
							prosper—performed by the English Company of players— They announced that
							at the request of Lord Gambier, and the other English Commissioners,
							they were to perform two representations more—next Wednesday and Friday;
							and that they should also perform on Monday— While we were at the
							Theatre, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes invited me to sup with
							him at his Rooms.— Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin, Bayard,
							Forbes and Milligan were there— I left them and came home about
							Midnight. We received this morning from the British Plenipotentiaries an
							invitation to dine with them next Wednesday; but we had engaged company
							at our own house, and sent excuses.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI. </date>The arrears of this Journal, though of few days have
							become important— The transactions of the present week; from our receipt
							of the British Note and project of a Treaty last Sunday, have been such
							as made it desirable to commit them as soon as possible to writing. They
							have at the same time left me so little leisure, that I have not been
							able to keep my record even with the current of time. In the minutes I
							am here making as well of <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">our
								Mission</persRef> Meetings as of the Conferences with the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, I can only note the most important
							particulars which occur, and I have frequent occasion to remark, that
							the impression and even the understanding of what is said, differs very
							much, among different persons. I brought my narrative down this morning
							to the day before yesterday, and began upon that. A <persRef
								ref="martel-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen
								Martel</persRef> a Frenchman by birth, but who has resided some
							years in America came yesterday morning; and told me that his Uncle; a
								<persRef ref="walsh-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walsh</persRef>, an Irishman, but a Citizen of the United-States,
							had been for several years the American Consul at Cette, near
							Montpelier— That he Martel had been the Chancellor of the Consulate, and
							he produced to me his Commission from the Consul to that effect— He said
							he had just received the news of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh’s
							death, and he was desirous of obtaining the appointment of Consul in his
							place— He was connected in trade with the first commercial house in
							Montpelier, and was now here travelling upon their business, and he came
							to ask me whether I thought he could obtain the Consulate, and what
							steps it would be necessary for him to take for the purpose. I advised
							him to write to the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, informing him of the decease of the Consul, and he
							might at the same time apply for the appointment, and represent the
							circumstances which entitle him to ask for it. He came again this
							morning, and brought me the Letter, with a duplicate and triplicate,
							requesting me to forward them— He asked me, whether he could not in the
							interim, perform the duties of the Consul— I thought not; unless he
							could obtain the authority from the <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">American Minister</persRef> in France,
							to whom I advised him to apply for it.— I had a visit also this morning
							from <persRef ref="shaw-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Shaw</persRef> of New-York— He arrived last Evening from London, and
							is on his way to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg. I did not
							recollect him when he first came in, though he mentioned having been
							formerly acquainted with me in Holland, and in England— He intended to
							have proceeded on his journey this day— I wrote a short Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>—enclosed to
							her two Letters I had received from America for <persRef
								ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">father Brzozowsky</persRef>, the General of
							the Jesuits, and the packet which <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Du Roveray</persRef> sent me, for <persRef ref="krehmer-anna">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Krehmer</persRef>. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw was not prepared for a Journey to
							Russia, at this Season of the Year; and I so strongly urged him to use
							precautions against the rigours of the Season and climate that he is to
							encounter, that he concluded to have alterations made of his Carriage,
							and will thus be detained here until next Tuesday. He dined with us— And
							with a company as numerous as we could entertain—<persRef
								ref="meulemeester-jean;meulemeester-therese">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Milligan</persRef>, <persRef ref="irving-peter">Irving</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="forbes-ralph">Forbes</persRef> and Shaw— We were

							did not play— Madame Greban, who is affected with nervous complaints was
							taken unwell and declined playing— She stayed however the whole Evening;
							partly with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s chamber. She <pb n="181" type="ms"
							/>fancied she had glass legs. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw
							brought to my recollection two circumstances, one of which occurred when
							he was dining with me at the Hague; and one afterwards, at London—also
							at the dinner table— The latter was a laughable qui-pro-quo between him
							and <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Boylston</persRef>, which I perfectly
							remember— The former was some thing of a similar kind, between him and a
								<persRef ref="cutting-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutting</persRef> of New-York, who was then his fellow traveller,
							and whom as well as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw himself I had
							entirely forgotten— I now remember their having dined with me at the
							Hague— But not the incident at the dinner— Shaw says that in the year
							1807. he went with me in the Stage from Philadelphia to New-York. I had
							also forgotten this; though I remembered <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cadwalader’s</persRef> having been of
							the Company as far as Trenton or Princeton— I had some conversation this
							Evening with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornelissen on subjects of
							Literature, the Arts, Religion and Politics. The company left us about
							Midnight.</p>

								<persRef ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cornelissen</persRef> came this morning with a small Latin pamphlet,
							on the art of Stenography. It is the work of a <persRef ref="bossuyt-j"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bossuyt</persRef>, printed but
							not published. The author he said wished to dedicate it to <persRef

								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, and me, as we had all been members of Congress, and
							as it was upon an Art, chiefly subservient to that of public speaking.
							Cornelissen had with him a manuscript Latin dedication, and asked if it
							would be acceptable to us— I told him it would be quite agreeable to me,
							and I presumed to my Colleagues, to whom he would do well, to speak of
							it, and who would answer for themselves— He said the author wished
							merely to shew us a mark of respect; but that he was a man of fortune,
							and that no pecuniary compensation was in his view, or would be
							acceptable to him— I made some remarks to him on the dedication which
							was in good Latin— He asked me whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay understood Latin— I said I believed not— He said there would then
							be a difficulty in explaining the whole subject to him, and that it
							would be best to address the dedication solely to me— I looked into the
							pamphlet, but the system appeared to me inferior to that of <persRef
								ref="byrom-john">Byrom</persRef>. Nor have I ever met with one equal
							to it— I walked about two hours before dinner— The Night before last was
							the first considerable frost. Last Night was the second; and the whole
							time I was walking this day, there was a fall of snow, hail, and sleet.
							It covered the ground but all disappeared again before Night. I had a
							visit also this morning from young <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p><date>5. VI: </date>I finished at length the report of the conference on
							the first of this month and began upon the second day— <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> came into my chamber this morning immediately
							after breakfast, with a Letter to our Landlord <persRef ref="u"
								>Lannuier</persRef>, from <persRef ref="lannuier-henry">his
								brother</persRef> at New-York— It is dated 24 October, and contains
							a short account of the late political events in America— It concludes by
							saying that a Courier had that morning arrived with the news that
								<persRef ref="drummond-gordon">General Drummond</persRef> and his
							army had been totally defeated, and had surrendered as prisoners— It
							bore a Post-mark which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thought
							was Martinique, but which I took for S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Martin— From the date of the Letter, the very day that the Fingal
							sailed, and the last Article of the news in it, I suspected it to be a
							forgery; or some trick, to deceive us— But in the Evening M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee</persRef> at
							Bordeaux, dated 25 November, and mentioning that a vessel had arrived at
							La Rochelle, after a short passage from New-York—but that nothing had
							transpired of news brought by her.— <persRef ref="forbes-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes</persRef> called upon me, and
							expressed a wish to be sent as a special messenger with dispatches to
							Paris. And he asked my opinion as a friend and a lawyer, whether the
							character of a Messenger, or that of Consul at Hamburg would protect him
							from arrest; to satisfy a judgment upwards of 20000 francs, which a man
							at Nantes has against him— It was for a debt of his relations the
							Murray’s of New-York, with which he says he had no concern, excepting
							that of having lent them his name. It had been recovered in 1798 and he
							had known nothing of it until 1805 when he was informed of it at
							Hamburg. In the mean time he, and <persRef ref="forbes-ralph">his
								brother</persRef> had been unfortunate in business at New-York, and
							had taken the benefit of the bankrupt act. This was the only claim
							outstanding against him, and he had not been released from it, only
							because he had not known its existence. He now wants to go to Paris on
							account of a patent for making Cordage, the right to which he has
							purchased at Copenhagen of <persRef ref="barron-james">Captain James
								Barron</persRef>. It is by an invention, already in use in England,
							but which Barron has made his own by recollection from the mere sight of
							the machinery— Forbes said his brother was gone to Paris, and might
							perhaps conclude the business, without making it necessary for himself
							to go— But if not and I thought he would be as a messenger protected
							from an arrest to satisfy that judgment; he would apply to the mission
							to be sent as Messenger whenever there might be an occasion to send
							dispatches to Paris— I told Forbes that I did not think <pb n="182"
								type="ms"/>his character as Consul at Hamburg would protect him from
							an arrest at-all; nor the character of a Messenger, any longer, than
							merely to reach Paris, to deliver his dispatches, and perhaps to return—
							He spoke of asking <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> to attach him to
							his Legation— I told him that I thought neither M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford nor we could do any thing to rescue him by an
							official privilege from the operation of municipal laws, to the exercise
							of which against him he would otherwise be liable. If we should have
							occasion to send a Messenger with dispatches, I presumed there would be
							no objection to committing them to him— But it could not protect him for
							any stay at Paris— He concluded to wait and see, if the business could
							not be transacted by his brother— <persRef ref="shaw-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef> dined with us, and in
							the Evening we went to the Concert which was bad—<persRef ref="u"

						<p><date>8. VI. </date>I made this morning a draft of an Answer to propose
							to <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">my
								Colleagues</persRef>, to be sent to the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, to the note received yesterday from
							them respecting the seduction and sale of Negroes taken from our
							Southern States by British Officers— The note gives us an express
							assurance that any officer found guilty of such practices shall be
							punished in an exemplary manner— But it confounds together the two acts
							of seducing the slaves and afterwards selling them, and promises only to
							punish the whole.— It is the seduction of the Slaves that constitutes
							the offence against us— As to the sale of them afterwards, the British
							Government have no right to ask of us, and we have no sufficient motive
							to give them, proofs of that fact, unless they will disavow and pledge
							themselves also to punish the other— I therefore in my draft offered to
							produce the proof, if they would engage to indemnify the owners of the
							negroes, for the loss of them—and for the proof of <pb n="183" type="ms"
							/>seduction, referred to <persRef ref="cochrane-alexander">Admiral
								Cochrane’s</persRef> Proclamation, of 2. April last, of which we
							have sent a copy with one of our former Notes— I requested a meeting of
							the Mission at my chamber at Noon— It was accordingly held. I read the
							draft I had made, but there appeared much diversity of opinion as to the
							proper mode of proceeding in this case. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard is afraid of irritating the British Government. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thinks our proof weak, and seems
							to have a doubt though he does not exactly avow it, whether the fact can
							be proved— We have only one affidavit, but that is as strong both to the
							general practice and to a particular instance in the knowledge of the
							deponent, as any proof could be— <persRef ref="hughes-christopher"
								>Hughes</persRef> remarked to me however that the deponents
							christian name was Patrick; which he did not like— I asked him why? He
							answered—Irish. . . M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin was averse
							to requiring of the British Government to disavow and punish the
							seduction, because he said they would not only refuse to do it, but that
							all the opponents of the Slave-trade, would approve and justify the act.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell said he had taken much the
							same view of the subject as that in my draft, but it was finally
							proposed and agreed to postpone the answer, until we shall hear further
							from the British Plenipotentiaries, on the main subject of the Treaty— I
							began a Letter to <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>10. VI: </date>We had a meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef> at eleven this morning; and at 12 had a
							Conference with the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, at our house— Lord Gambier opened it by
							observing that the first thing to be done was to settle the Protocol of
							the last Meeting, which <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef> had drawn up, and
							which he then read.— We admitted it with some alterations which we
							suggested, and to which the British Plenipotentiaries agreed— <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> is to have a copy of it— Lord Gambier then
							proceeded to state the determination of the British Government upon the
							points referred to them after the last conference— They insisted upon
							retaining the words “belonging to” as applied to the Territory to be
							restored, but were willing to modify the expressions in such manner as
							to avoid the objection that it gave each party the right to judge in the
							first instance of what did or did not belong to the other—this
							modification might be by confining the exception to the general
							restoration to the Islands in Passamaquoddy Bay. As to them the British
							Government considered their title so clear, that it was a great
							concession in them to allow the right to them to be brought into
							discussion; and that they should be included in the objects to be
							settled by Commissioners.— I said that we could not reply to this or any
							other proposal from the British Government, until we should have an
							opportunity of consulting together— Lord Gambier then passed to the
							eighth Article. He stated that the British Government had considered the
								49<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> parallel of Latitude, agreed to as
							our boundary from the Lake of the Woods, as no more than an equivalent
							for the right of the British to navigate the Mississippi claimed by the
							part of the Article to which we had objected— His Lordship was corrected
							by his two Colleagues, who reminded him that their Government meant it
							was no less than an equivalent; that is, a full equivalent. . . Did not
							I say so, said his Lordship— His colleagues told him <pb n="184"
								type="ms"/>he had not—well, he had meant so. Because the 49<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> parallel of Latitude had given to the
							United States an increase of territory— I said that it was no increase
							of territory but rather a diminution of territory to the United-States.
							The line prescribed by the Treaty of 1783. was from the northwest corner
							of the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi due West— But this line was
							a nullity—it was not in rerum natura— A Line due west from the Lake of
							the Woods it had been found did not touch the Mississippi— But by the
							terms of the Treaty we were entitled to a line due west from the
							Northwest corner of the Lake, and that was North of 49, by accepting
							that parallel we really gave up some of our territory, perhaps half a
							degree of Latitude— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said that as
							to that, the views of the two Governments might be matter of
							controversy; but the British Government were willing to leave that <hi
								rend="strikethrough">Article</hi> part of the Article as it stood—
							They did not assent to either of alternatives—to leave out the whole
							Article; or to strike out simply the last paragraph; or to strike it out
							and substitute the provision we had proposed, confirming their rights to
							navigate the Mississippi, and our rights to the fisheries within their
							jurisdiction— But they would agree to strike it out offering a
							substitute of their own. This was that Great-Britain agreed to negotiate
							with the United States for granting the fisheries within the British
							Jurisdiction, for an equivalent to be granted by the United States— And
							that the United States agreed to negotiate with Great-Britain, for
							granting to British subjects the right to Navigate the Mississippi, for
							an equivalent to be granted by Great-Britain— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker read this Article, and it was left with us for
							consideration— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin hinted a wish
							again to amend the first part of the Article to guard against the
							possibility that the 49<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> parallel of
							Latitude should not touch the Lake of the Woods— He said the proof that
							it did consisted of a single observation taken by a <persRef
								ref="thompson-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomson</persRef> in <persRef ref="mackenzie-alexander"
								>Mackenzie’s</persRef> Journey— This was however not pressed— We had
								<persRef ref="arrowsmith-aaron">Arrowsmith’s</persRef> last map
							(1811.) of North America; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said
							he had no doubt the 49<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> degree would touch
							the Lake.— In accepting the Article proposed by the British
							Plenipotentiaries, for the periods of the cessation of hostilities, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed some alterations, both
							of the Latitudes and of the terms The most material one was to shorten
							from the term of 45 to 30 days, from the exchange of ratifications the
							period for the two channels, particularly to include the Port of
							Liverpool— The proposed alterations were taken by the British
							Plenipotentiaries for Consideration— We had some desultory Conversation
							with regard to the method of securing the transmission of the Treaty, as
							speedily as possible; that it might arrive in America before the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of March— I proposed that we should sign
							three copies of the Treaty all as originals, to guard against the
							accidents to which a single vessel will be liable— Lord Gambier said he
							had intended to propose the same thing— But D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams thought that the Great Seal of England could be
							affixed only to one Ratification— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							observed that however that might be a general rule, an exception might
							be considered proper for the peculiarity of a Treaty with a power beyond
							the Ocean— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn promised that they
							would propose it to their Government; and I proposed if the difficulty
							of putting the Great Seal to duplicates was insuperable, that the
							periods for ceasing hostilities should be dated not from the exchange of
							the Ratifications; but from the time of Ratification in America— Because
							our Government could ratify upon an authentic Copy, but the Exchange
							could only be for the Ratification under the great Seal— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams made some difficulties still about
							shortening the terms— He said there must be time for giving notice to
							the Cruizers, for those people when they had taken prizes, were very
							unwilling to give them up— I had said that the worst that could happen
							would be if a few prizes should be taken, without notice, would be that
							they must be restored— An evil not to be compared to that of keeping the
							general commercial intercourse unnecessarily closed— I observed it was
							impossible to expect the American ratification could be received in
							England earlier than March, and at that season a difference of fifteen
							days would be important to the Spring exportations from the British
							Ports to the United States— This consideration appeared to make some
							impression upon all the British Plenipotentiaries— They offered two new
							Articles, one stipulating a concurrence of measures for abolishing the
							slave-trade, and the other that the Courts of Justice should be open in
							each of the two Countries, to the Subjects and Citizens of the other—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams observed of the first that it
							was nothing at all—a matter <pb n="185" type="ms"/>of no
							consequence—binding to no particular act; and only sanctioning
							legislative acts which both had adopted— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Gallatin said the Courts in England had actually proceeded to condemn
							American Vessels, for violations of the Laws of the United States,
							against the Slave Trade; but that there would be a difficulty in the
							Courts of the United States to give a similar judgment against British
							Vessels for the violation of the English Statutes on the same Subject.
							That it could be done only by a Treaty, in which the offence should be
							assimilated to piracy; and it should be agreed to punish the offenders
							as Pirates— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that no such
							Treaty could be made— That piracy was an offence against all Nations,
							and punishable by every Nation— That a Nation might if it pleased make
							any other Act of its own subjects punishable as Piracy by its own
							Courts—but no one Nation and no two Nations could make that piracy,
							which is not recognized as such by other Nations— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he was aware of that; but
							they might assimilate it to piracy, and make it punishable in the same
							manner— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard denied that they could—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams said that the Judgment in
							England had been only in one case— He had been concerned in it, and
							named the vessel— The Lords of the Council had long hesitated, and there
							had been a great diversity of opinion among them upon it . . . they
							finally decided upon a communication of the Law of the United States, by
								<persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pinkney</persRef>, and his urgent sollicitation— As to the opening
							of the Courts of Justice, the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said
							laughing that was an Article that all the lawyers should support— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay intimated that such an Article might
							have been necessary at the Peace of 1783, but it would be unnecessary
							now— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said it could only be for
							greater security, and to quiet the apprehensions of persons who might
							think it would be otherwise— A remark was made to us that it would be
							proper to alter the title of Lord Gambier, who at the time of his
							appointment to this mission was a Vice-Admiral of the white Squadron,
							but has since been promoted and is now a Vice-Admiral of the Red
							Squadron, to this alteration we of course agreed— After a conference of
							about two hours they left us, and we continued another hour in Session—
							We considered generally the subject of their proposals; and each of us
							made his remarks upon them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin was
							much in favour of the Slave Trade Article, and had originally drawn one
							up to be proposed on our part. I had some objections to it, as tending
							to give dissatisfaction to France, Spain and Portugal, with whom Britain
							is now negotiating on the same subject, and who are very unwilling to
							yield to the British views upon it. The article for opening the Courts
							we considered as unnecessary and objectionable. But the two great points
							of difficulty remaining are the restoration of the Islands in
							Passamaquoddy Bay, and the Article about the Mississippi, and the
							fisheries. We agreed still to persist in our objection to their
							insertion of the words belonging to, and to their modifications
							excepting those Islands from the general restoration. We also determined
							to object to the proposed modification of the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> Article as altogether unnecessary, stipulating only what
							the parties may at any time agree to without stipulation, and admitting
							on our part a principle contrary to that which we have stated to have
							been prescribed by our Government— But my Colleagues were only for
							making an experiment of resistance, and I was for making it positive and
							determinate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that the only
							object they could have in offering their present proposal relative to
							the Mississippi and the fisheries was to beat us off from our own
							ground— The stipulation that the parties will negotiate hereafter
							amounts to nothing— But it admits that both the rights as secured by the
							Peace of 1783. are forfeited.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							said they had precisely inverted our proposition— We had offered the
							Navigation of the Mississippi as the equivalent for the fisheries in
							their jurisdiction; they offer to abandon the Navigation if we will
							abandon that part of the fisheries.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Gallatin said that we should certainly lose that part of the fisheries,
							that our ground for claiming them was untenable and we never could
							support it— That he was very sorry it had ever been stipulated in the
							Peace of 1783. and he would not have accepted it as an offer.— I told
							him that my name was to an official paper assuming the ground which he
							now pronounced untenable, and so was his— He said that we had only
							assumed it as the principle upon which our government had instructed us
							not to bring the fisheries into discussion— That he did not consider
							himself as pledged to it at-all as his own opinion. I told him that I
							was pledged to it as mine; and believed the ground to be perfectly
							tenable and solid— I was confident it could be supported too; for our
							people would exercise it; and could not be prevented from exercising it,
							without the constant maintenance of an armed force to drive them from it
							far more expensive than the object would be worth, and more than
							Great-Britain would maintain. I added that the present British
							proposition proved most clearly to me two things— One that <hi
								rend="italic">they</hi> did not consider our ground in <hi
								rend="strikethrough">the</hi> regard to the fisheries as weak or
							untenable, since they offered to abandon all pretension to the right of
							navigating the Mississippi, if we would give up our claim to that part
							of the fisheries, such as it is— The other that <hi rend="italic"
								>they</hi> considered that part of our fishing rights as <pb n="186"
								type="ms"/>more than an equivalent for the Navigation of the
							Mississippi; since we had offered to continue both; the one for the
							other; which they declined, and proposed to us in its stead to abandon
							both, the one for the other.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin
							admitted the correctness of my first inference, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay disputed the second. He said the
							offer of the British to abandon both rights did not prove that they
							thought ours worth more than theirs, but that they could obtain more for
							conceding it. We adjourned to meet again at eleven to morrow Morning— I
							had time only for a short walk before dinner— I passed the Evening at
								<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">our
								Mission</persRef> meeting, employed on the Journal of yesterday.
								<persRef ref="carroll-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef> arrived from London, and brought me a letter from
								<persRef ref="beasley-reuben">Beasley</persRef>, with <persRef

								Bentzon</persRef>, and a pamphlet by <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves</persRef>. The meeting was in
							my chamber, and it was near Noon before we were all assembled.— The
							questions were resumed what should be done with the present British
							proposals, and in what manner—whether by another conference or by a
							written Note— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell was averse to the
							Conference— He thought it much safer for us that the discussions should
							be in writing rather than verbal— It is evident that the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> can do nothing of themselves— They have
							no discretionary powers— They must refer every thing we propose to their
							Government— When we write they refer our propositions in our own words
							and supported by our own reasoning— When we merely confer, we leave the
							statement of our arguments entirely to them— They give them their own
							colouring, and naturally make their case as favourable to themselves as
							they can— I was of the same opinion with the additional motive of
							hastening to a conclusion of our business— We have not advanced a step
							in our conferences; nor shall we advance a step until we come to
							writing.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said the British
							Government was now evidently desirous of Peace, and of concluding as
							soon as possible— The two new Articles were proofs of that; for they
							were merely to make the Peace palatable to their Nation. I said I
							entertained still great doubts of their intentions. That my anxiety was
							much greater than it had been at any period of the Negotiation—
							Infinitely greater than when their demands had been so extravagant that
							we were sure of being supported by our Country in rejecting them— When I
							saw them abandoning every thing of any value in their demands, and
							stubbornly adhering to hairs, merely as it seemed to me to keep the
							Negotiation open, I could not but deeply distrust their intentions— They
							clung to atoms, involving principles which they had abandoned as applied
							to every thing important— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said
							that was the course of all Negotiations— That <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef> had broken off with
							Austria at Prague, merely upon a question whether he should keep or give
							up Hamburg, and Triest— That he had made war with England merely for
							Malta— But I said in those cases there was the determination of War, on
							both sides, and if they had not broken on one point they would on
							another— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said Bonaparte had on
							the contrary been very unwilling at that time to go to War with England—
							But England did intend the War— That is precisely what I apprehend now,
							and that she keeps these points open merely to gain time, to break off
							at last, and then to have the pretence that the blame of breaking off
							upon a trifle was on our side. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin
							said it was an extraordinary thing that the question of Peace and War,
							now depended solely upon two points in which the people of the State of
							Massachusetts alone were interested. Moose-Island, and the fisheries
							within British Jurisdiction— I said that was the very perfidious
							character of the British Propositions— They wished to give us the
							appearance of having sacrificed the interests of the Eastern Section of
							the Union to those of the Western—to enable the disaffected in
							Massachusetts to say, the Government<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> of
							the United States has given up <hi rend="italic">our</hi> territory, and
								<hi rend="italic">our</hi> fisheries, merely to deprive the British
							of their right to navigate the Mississippi— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell said it was peculiarly unfortunate that the
							interests thus contested were those of a disaffected party of the
							Country— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that he would do
							nothing to satisfy disaffection and treason; he would not yield any
							thing for the sake of them— But said I, you would not give disaffection
							and treason the right to say to the People, that their interests had
							been sacrificed— He said No— But he was for a War three years longer. He
							had no doubt but three years more of War would make us a warlike people,
							and that then we should come out of the War with honour— Whereas at
							present even upon the best terms we could possibly obtain we shall have
							only a half formed army, and half retrieve our military reputation— He
							was for playing <hi rend="italic">Brag</hi>, with the <pb n="187"
								type="ms"/>British Plenipotentiaries— They had been playing <hi
								rend="italic">Brag</hi> with us throughout the whole Negotiation. He
							thought it was time for us to begin to play Brag with them— He asked me
							if I knew how to play <hi rend="italic">Brag</hi>.— I had forgotten how.
							He said the art of it was to beat your adversary by holding your hand
							with a solemn and confident phiz; and out-bragging him— He appealed to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, if it was not— Aye said
							Bayard—but you may lose the game by bragging until the adversary sees
							the weakness of your hand— And Bayard added to me—M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay is for bragging a Million against a
							Cent— I said the principle was the great thing which we could not
							concede; it was directly in the face of our Instructions— We could not
							agree to it, and I was for saying so positively at once— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that there was <hi
								rend="italic">nothing</hi> left in dispute but the principle— I did
							not think so— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said I, supposing
							Moose-Island belonged to Kentucky, and had been for many years
							represented as a District in your Legislature; would you give it up as
							Nothing? M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, if it belonged to
							Delaware, would you?— Bayard laughed and said Delaware could not afford
							to give up territory— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said it
							made no difference to what state it belonged. It was to be defended
							precisely in the same manner, whether to one or to another.— It was
							agreed positively to object to the British proposals on both points—the
							first as inconsistent with the admitted Basis of Status ante Bellum; and
							the second as unnecessary, contrary to our Instructions, and a new
							demand since we had been told that they had brought forward <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi> their demands.— We also determined to ask one
							more conference before we resorted to writing—at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard’s suggestion; and because it would be expected by the
							British Plenipotentiaries, that they should have notice of our wish to
							recur to writing. It was asked by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, whether we should at this conference, in rejecting the British
							proposals, offer the general status ante Bellum, by which the renewal of
							the Treaties of 1783. and 1794 would both be included— He was for making
							it, because he thought it would be for our advantage— I was for
							repeating it, and dwelling upon it, because it was that from which alone
							I think we can obtain peace, and because I consider it as already made
							by us. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin makes a distinction that
							we only offered the Status ante Bellum upon all the subjects of <hi
								rend="italic">difference</hi> between the parties, and not upon
							subjects about which there was no difference— I have uniformly
							disclaimed this distinction; though it was upon it alone that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was prevailed upon to sign the Note
							containing the offer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay now said that
							he would not propose the general status ante Bellum, and we were not
							authorised to it by our Instructions.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Russell thought the authority in our Instructions limited to the
							restoration of territory— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							answered that we had needed no new Instruction for that; we had always
							had that authority.— I produced the Instruction of 19. October— It is
							unlimited. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that the Instruction
							was drawn without knowledge of the Indian Article to which we had
							agreed— That in assenting to that Article he had declared that was the
							utmost extent of the sacrifice, in that quarter to which he would
							consent; and with that Article, he would never sign a Treaty on the
							general status ante Bellum, including the British right to trade with
							the Indians, so help him God . . . to keep him steady to his purpose— He
							said this in the harsh, angry, and overbearing tone, which I, perhaps
							more than others, ought to excuse as the involuntary effusion of a too
							positive temper— It always offends me in him; but I took no notice of it
							this day. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, said that every one of us must act
							according to his own sentiments— But Clay stalked to and fro across the
							chamber repeating five or six times “I will never sign a Treaty upon the
							Status ante Bellum, with the Indian Article, so help me God![”]— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell declared himself against proposing
							it to-morrow, and I again urged to propose it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay then said he should object to the Conference
							altogether— We came to no express decision but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin did not
							support me in the resolution to make the proposal, so that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay actually beat again a majority by
							out-bragging us— We sent <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef> to ask a conference
							with the British Plenipotentiaries at their house to-morrow. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay it was rather late for him to come
							out with his violent opposition to the Indian Article, when I had at the
							time offered him to break upon it, and neither he nor M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell would support me, though both of
							them had since been so much against it— He said I had been the first to
							say we must admit it, and that it was even advantageous to us, by
							securing Peace with the Indians— I denied ever having said we must admit
							it— I had said I considered it advantageous to us in <hi rend="italic"
								>that respect</hi>; as it secured to us Peace with the Indians—and I
							still continue of that opinion— But I thought it otherwise so
							objectionable, that I appealed to his recollection and to that of all my
							other Colleagues <pb n="188" type="ms"/>if I had not offered to reject
							the Article, though at the hazard of breaking off the Negotiation? M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that I had on the first day when
							the Article was received said so much in favour of admitting the Article
							that he had reflected, and made up his mind to admit it; declaring that
							he would make no further sacrifice in that quarter— But however said he,
							with a laugh—you will not deny that you <hi rend="italic">signed</hi>
							the Note first, and so you must be responsible for the Article— Bayard
							said, aye but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay there was no majority
							for it, till you had signed; you made the Majority, and so you must
							alone responsible for the Article— Clay said, and I agreed with him that
							at any rate the Peace would be bad enough— As for him, he believed it
							would break him down entirely; and we should all be subject to much
							reproach for it— Bayard thought it would on the contrary be highly
							creditable to us— It would relieve the Country from such an immense
							pressure—twenty one Millions of taxes— Commerce restored, and
							substantially nothing given up— I told him that when the People were
							secure in the enjoyment of all we should obtain, they would count it for
							nothing, and only look at what we had yielded—and the very people now
							the most clamorous against the War, would then be equally clamorous
							against the concessions made by us for Peace— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin said that almost all Treaties were unpopular, and
							ours if we made one would share the common fate— I took a walk before
							dinner; and in the Evening went to the Theatre, where I saw Montano et
							Stephanie, and La Caravanne. The last is with Music of <persRef
								ref="gretry-andre">Gretry</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cornelissen</persRef> told me that he had sent to Paris and procured
							the Lettres sur La Silésie, and that he meant to republish them here— He
							asked me if I could furnish him with an English copy to compare with the
							French, but I have none.</p>

						<p><date>12. IV: </date>We had adjourned our meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>mission</persRef> until eleven this Morning; and actually met a few
							minutes before twelve— I was employed until then upon the Journal of
							yesterday. At noon we went to the house of the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> and held a conference with them until
							three. After we were seated, I stated that we had deliberated upon the
							last proposals, presented by them—the differences yet to be adjusted
							were only two; both of so small amount in point of interest that they
							could hardly be subjects worthy of two such Nations as the United States
							and Great-Britain to contend about. The first was reduced to a question
							about the temporary possession of the Islands in Passamaquoddy Bay— We
							could not consent to cede the possession permanent or temporary of any
							part of the State of Massachusetts— We could not even have authority
							from the Government of the United States to make such a cession without
							the consent of the State.— That whatever might be the opinion of
							Great-Britain with regard to her right to those Islands, our conviction
							was entire that they belonged to the State of Massachusetts as much as
							any portion of its territory.— It had been said by one of the British
							Plenipotentiaries, that this exception would be no deviation from the
							principle of the Status ante Bellum— But it was an exception to it in
							the very purport of the phrase. It was a military possession taken
							during the War which the British Government now insisted upon retaining—
							The possession in the United States had been undisturbed during the
							Peace, and we only asked to be replaced in this as in all the other
							cases in the same state which existed at the commencement of the War—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Goulburn and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams, immediately took fire, and Goulburn lost all controul
							of his temper— He has always in such cases a sort of convulsive
							agitation about him, and the tone in which he speaks is more insulting
							than the language that he uses. He said that if there could be no
							cession of territory without the consent of the State, there could be no
							safety for Great-Britain in treating with the United States at all—for
							that if any parts of the disputed territory should be finally adjudged
							to Great-Britain in the manner provided by the Treaty, the delivery of
							it might be refused on the same pretence that the State had not
							consented to it— That the possession by the United States of these
							Islands had not been undisturbed—that they had always been known to be
							within the Government of Nova-Scotia— That jurors had been drawn from
							them to attend the Courts in the Province of New Brunswick— That when
							the Government of Massachusetts had first attempted to exercise
							Jurisdiction there, strong remonstrances had been made against it by
								<persRef ref="carleton-guy">Governor Carleton</persRef>; that
							Great-Britain, merely from forbearance and to avoid hostilities, had
							avoided sending a military force to take possession; and <pb n="189"
								type="ms"/>that surely her forbearance, ought not now to be urged
							against her as an obligation of right to restore the possession of what
							belongs to her— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams repeated with less
							virulence of manner the same arguments and both of them hinted not only
							that they must refer the subject back to their Government, but that they
							were extremely apprehensive, if we did not give up the point their
							Government would break off the Negotiation upon it— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said that as to the value of the
							interest, that was no consideration whatever— That the honour of the
							British Nation was concerned in it; and what the islands were worth was
							entirely out of the question— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							replied that from the assertion by me that the territory of a State
							could not be ceded by the Government of the United States, without its
							consent, no inference could be drawn that where the right to the
							territory was in dispute, the Government of the United States was not
							fully competent to the adjustment of the dispute— If in this case the
							final decision of the referees should be in favour of Great-Britain, it
							will be that the territory never belonged to Massachusetts, and no
							consent of hers to its cession can be necessary— No cession will be
							made— Of this principle Great-Britain has already had proof by the
							decision of the Commissioners concerning the River S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Croix, under the Treaty of 1794. By that
							decision a portion of territory which had been in the possession of
							Massachusetts and was claimed by her was found to belong to
							Great-Britain, and the possession was delivered accordingly. But our
							objection was that Great-Britain by now retaining a possession taken by
							force during the war, prejudged the question of right, which by the
							Article agreeing to the reference she admitted to exist— Our
							acquiescence in her retaining that possession, would be an admission of
							a better title on her part, and would affect the validity of our claim—
							With regard to the point of honour suggested by D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams, we could not enter into argument, as undoubtedly
							every Nation must be its own judge of what concerned its own honour— But
							he trusted they would perceive that the argument applied as forcibly to
							us as to them— Our opinion of our right was as strong as theirs could
							possibly be of their’s. Our possession had been pacific; theirs was mere
							military occupation— Our possession had even preceded the peace of
							1783—though he knew we had never had a garrison there until 1808. It was
							now for the first time that he heard that Great-Britain had ever
							exercised jurisdiction there since the Peace of 1783. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said they had done so until 1798—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard repeated in substance the
							distinction already taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin,
							between the authority of the United States to cede territory and that to
							settle a question of disputed title, and he added that by delivering
							possession to Great-Britain, if the decision should finally be in favour
							of the United States we should then have ceded a temporary possession of
							territory belonging to us— I observed that my two Colleagues had so
							fully explained the distinction upon which I had first stated our
							incompetency to cede by virtue of authority from the United States,
							territory belonging to a State, without affecting our competency to
							provide for the adjustment of a dispute concerning the title to
							territory, that they had left me nothing further to say. We had
							undoubtedly authority to refer a dispute, and the possession would of
							course follow the decision— But until that decision we were bound to
							consider the territory as ours, and could have no authority to cede the
							possession of it.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that however
							that might be, and waving the consideration of it our objection to the
							alteration of the Article was that it would make it inconsistent both
							with the general and the special principle of the whole Treaty.— The
							general principle was the restoration of all territory to the state
							before the War— The special principle was the reference to
							Commissioners, and if necessary subsequently to a friendly Sovereign, of
							all the disputes respecting territory. This would be an express
							departure from both— Adams and Goulburn insisted that it was not in
							consequence of the occupation during the War, of those Islands that they
							wished to retain the possession, but because they considered them as
							their own— I observed that Great-Britain herself had more than ten years
							ago admitted in a formal convention that they were ours.— That makes
							against you, said Goulburn—for our Government refused a partial
							ratification of the Convention— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
							with a view to cite the principle heretofore insisted upon by
							Great-Britain in a similar case asked, how was the case of the Falkland
							Islands?—“why,[”] (said Goulburn in a transport of rage,) “in that case,
							we sent a fleet and troops, and drove the fellows off; and that is what
							we ought to have done in this case!” I said, I believed the gentleman’s
							recollection of the case was not exact— That as I remembered it, the
							Spaniards in that case had driven the British off, and Great-Britain had
							insisted upon being restored to the possession, though she immediately
								<pb n="190" type="ms"/>afterwards abandoned it, and the claim to the
							islands themselves— Well (said Goulburn) we fitted out a fleet and
							troops, and Spain knew that we would have taken them, and so she chose
							to give them up.— Lord Gambier, seeing the condition in which his
							Colleague had placed himself said the discussion was taking such a turn
							that he thought it would be advisable to pass on to something else. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams however in a moderated tone said
							that the case of the Falkland Islands did not at-all apply in principle
							to this— That was an act of deliberate hostility committed by Spain in
							the midst of profound peace; this was a lawful occupation in the midst
							of War— We then passed on to the substitute, offered for the last
							paragraph of the eighth Article— It is a stipulation to negotiate
							hereafter for the fisheries within British Jurisdiction, and for the
							Navigation of the Mississippi by British Subjects, for fair equivalents.
							We stated that we could not admit this substitute— As a mere engagement
							to negotiate hereafter, it amounted to Nothing— The parties could always
							negotiate, if they should both be so inclined—and if either should be
							averse to it, negotiation would be unavailing since it would be in its
							power, by demanding an equivalent which the other would not grant, to
							make it abortive— The only effect then of this stipulation would be, an
							abandonment by us, of the ground upon which we claimed the right to the
							fisheries— We considered the entire Treaty of 1783, not as an ordinary
							Treaty, liable to be abrogated by a subsequent War between the parties;
							but as a compact containing the terms upon which two parts of one People
							mutually agreed to constitute two Independent Nations— By that Treaty
							British subjects were entitled to the right of navigating the
							Mississippi—our principle recognized the continuance of that right;
							Great-Britain however had asked of us a new stipulation to confirm it—
							If we agreed to it, a corresponding stipulation became necessary to
							confirm our right to that part of the fisheries. We asked no new
							stipulation in either case— We did not ask of Great-Britain to abandon
							her construction of the Treaty— But this demand on her part was a new
							claim, brought forward after we had been expressly assured that the
							British Note of 21 October contained <hi rend="italic">all</hi> they had
							to ask— Lord Gambier said that they did not consider the fisheries
							within their Jurisdiction, as rights; but merely as privileges granted—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said that it would be very
							easy to draw a proviso, by which it should be agreed to negotiate upon
							the two subjects, and yet without implying an abandonment on the part of
							the United States, of their claim.— I said if he thought it so easy, I
							would thank him to undertake it—I did not believe it possible— We had
							drawn up, and now proposed a general Article, founded on a precedent in
							the Treaty of 1794—engaging to negotiate upon all the subjects of
							difference unadjusted; which would include those of the Mississippi
							Navigation and the fisheries within British Jurisdiction— They read our
							Article and immediately rejected it, finding the word commerce in it—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed to leave that word
							out— Adams and Goulburn still refused the Article— Adams still said we
							might draw a proviso reserving our Construction of the Treaty of 1783.
							and agreeing to negotiate on the two subjects—and added that he
							mentioned it, because he believed that if the other question about the
							Islands could be got rid of, the British Government would be disposed to
							some accommodation upon this. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard
							drew a proviso for the purpose and handed it over the table— They read
							it and Lord Gambier immediately said, I for one can never agree to that.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard asked what the <hi
								rend="italic">object</hi> of the Article as proposed by the British
							Plenipotentiaries was— Adams and Goulburn said it was sent to them from
							England—they were not to account for the <hi rend="italic">motive</hi>,
							of their Government in proposing that or any other Article— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said he did not ask them for the
								<hi rend="italic">motive</hi> of their Government, but for the <hi
								rend="italic">object</hi> of the Article— He supposed Gentlemen
							would at least be authorised to explain that. D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Adams said they had sent us the Article as they had
							received it, and we must construe it for ourselves; he had only said,
							and it was merely his individual opinion; he would not wish to be
							understood as pledging the opinion of his Government or even of his
							Colleagues, but he had said he thought we might easily agree to an
							Article, with a proviso reserving our <pb n="191" type="ms"/>claim to
							the right by the Treaty of 1783— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							asked, if we could find any expedient to come to an agreement upon the
							other Article, the British Plenipotentiaries were authorised to accede
							to any modification of this, so that we might sign the Treaty without
							another reference to England— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn
							said they did not know— We had sent them three alternatives for their
							last paragraph of the eighth Article— One of these alternatives had been
							adopted in England—and sent back to them modified into this Article— We
							had offered them the Navigation of the Mississippi, clogged with
							Conditions which would render it of no effect—confining their access, to
							a single point, and upon a payment of full duties upon merchandize,
							intended merely to pass through our territories for exportation. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that had not been our
							intention— The access would be given, sufficient for all the purposes of
							transporting the merchandize, and by our laws a drawback from the duties
							was allowed upon the exportation of goods the benefit of which would be
							allowed of course to the merchandize only passing through for
							exportation— But surely said he you could not expect to introduce into
							the United States, your goods and merchandize duty free— And, said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, as you had drawn the first
							paragraph, you might have gone from Quebec; through any part of our
							territories— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said no; that was
							not their intention. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin then took
							the Mississippi and fisheries Article, proposed some alterations to it,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn hesitating upon them,
							Gallatin said that we laboured under great inconvenience and
							disadvantage in the negotiation— We had no opportunity of communicating
							with our Government; and were continually obliged to take responsibility
							upon ourselves, while they referred to their Government for every
							detail. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said they were so near
							that the inconvenience was but small, and upon the whole he considered
							it as a fortunate circumstance; as had it been otherwise we should not
							now have been here— He did however attempt to draw a proviso, admitting
							some of the alterations to the Article suggested by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin; but upon shewing it to Lord
							Gambier he said it amounted to the same thing as M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard’s. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn thought
							there was a great difference between them; but at last found an
							objection to his own draft, that it admitted a claim of Great-Britain to
							the Navigation of the Mississippi, by the Treaty of 1783.— I asked him
							upon what other ground than that of the Article in the Treaty of 1783.
							Great-Britain could now demand the Navigation of the Mississippi? He
							gave no direct answer to this question— The British Plenipotentiaries
							consulted together upon the Article and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Goulburn’s proviso. they at first suggested a wish that the conference
							might be adjourned to this Evening or to-morrow Morning when they would
							give us a definitive answer, whether they could conclude without a new
							reference to England; but they finally preferred receiving a
							communication from us in writing, and requested us to give them our
							ultimatum, upon the two points.— We told them with regard to the other
							two new Articles proposed by them, we did not think it necessary to
							discuss them until the other questions should be disposed of—but we
							thought it proper in candour to say, that we should admit in substance
							that relating to the Slave-trade, and that we should object to the
							other, which we considered as unnecessary, and hoped to convince the
							British Plenipotentiaries that it is so. It was agreed that the Protocol
							of this day’s conference should be only that the Plenipotentiaries met
							and after much discussion upon the subjects yet unadjusted, adjourned—
							At three O’Clock we returned home, and were in Meeting, until our dinner
							time, conversing in a desultory manner, upon the substance of the Note
							to be sent— The whole tenour of the Conference had confirmed me in the
							opinion that the British Government have insidiously kept these two
							points open, for the sake of finally breaking off the Negotiation, and
							making all their other concessions proofs of their extreme moderation to
							put upon us the blame of the rupture— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay was so confident that the British Government had resolved upon
							peace, that he said he would give himself as a hostage, and a victim to
							be sacrificed, if they broke off upon these points— It was thought by
							him and by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin that a note in a
							single page would be sufficient— I said it would be enough if we were to
							yield the points in controversy; but if we were to stand out upon them,
							it would be necessary to send a note of sixteen pages.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was for conceding the point
							respecting the Islands in Passamaquoddy Bay, and for standing out to the
							last extremity upon that of the fisheries—even if we should break upon
							it— Immediately after dinner, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							advised the <persRef
								ref="todd-john;gallatin-james;hughes-christopher;milligan-george"
								>young Gentlemen</persRef>
							<pb n="192" type="ms"/>to go and dress for the Ball, and we continued to
							discuss the subject among ourselves, until seven O’Clock. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin said that he was like myself;
							halting between two opinions; and unable to bring his mind to a
							conclusion which course would be the best. He must sleep upon it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was requested to draw up his Note in
							a single page to be presented for consideration at the meeting at eleven
							O’Clock to-morrow Morning— I did not attend the Ball, though Hail
							Columbia, was announced to be played, a Grand Orchestre!!! and was
							actually performed— But I passed the Evening in my chamber making a
							draft of a Note to be sent to the British Plenipotentiaries— I gave it
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, after he returned from the
							Ball, to make such use of it as he should think proper— It prolonged my
							Evening until near Midnight.</p>

								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin brought mine, with an unfinished one which he had drawn
							himself. They were all discussed, and there was a great diversity of
							opinions as to the course most proper to be pursued.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was for persisting in the rejection
							of both the British demands, but with the determination finally to yield
							both. He thought that by insisting equally upon both, we should most
							probably obtain a concession upon one— My draft had insisted upon both,
							with an intimation that if the case of the islands should be made an
							ultimatum we should rather subscribe to it though without authority,
							than break off the negotiation—but that we could not concede the point
							of the fisheries— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard was for giving
							up explicitly and without qualification the islands, and he was prepared
							to be much more flexible upon the fisheries than he had been yesterday.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell declared himself in favour
							of my draft, but was for yielding eventually if necessary upon both the
							points— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had taken the statement
							made yesterday by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn that the
							British had exercised Jurisdiction over Moose-Island, since the Peace of
							1783. as the motive for our concession upon that point—but his draft
							intimated too distinctly that we should ultimately yield on the other
							point if it should be pressed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							confined his observations chiefly to the Moose Island question— He
							inclined much to the opinion that the British argument was better than
							ours. That they were right upon the principle— At any rate we could not
							break upon it— We should not be supported in it by our own people—nor by
							the general opinion of Europe— We had at the commencement of the
							Negotiation thrown the blame of the War upon them— Europe and America
							had pronounced their demands extravagant and absurd— They had raised a
							powerful opposition against the War among their own people— They might
							be now playing a similar game against us. They might only want to draw
							us out to refuse concession upon these trifles, then to break off,
							retort upon us the blame of continuing the war, and make an ostentatious
							display of all the concessions they had made, only to ensnare us, as
							proofs of their moderation, and of our insincerity— Their own people
							would support them on this ground of rupture— Ours would not support
							us—the only chance we could possibly have of a successful continuation
							of the War was that our whole People should embark, heart and soul in
							it— They never would do so, for a war on the only ground now left us—
							Our divisions would become infinitely more dangerous and formidable— Our
							finances were in ruins— Enormous taxes such as our people have never
							known are the only means by which the War can possibly be carried on— A
							War is nothing to the British Government— They have now no other Enemy
							upon their hands— In a thousand years there could not happen again a
							concurrence of Circumstances under which War would be so unequal between
							us— So much to their advantage, and so disadvantageous to us— He was
							against hazarding the possibility of a rupture upon the Moose-Island
							question, and was for frankly giving it up at once.— I declared my
							concurrence in all these Sentiments. I said I had made my draft
							according to them, and under the full conviction of their weight— I had
							distinctly shewn our intention to yield the point, and had only
							continued to resist upon it, that they might declare it on their part an
							ultimatum— I wanted that to convince our Country that we had done every
							thing in our power to secure the object, and finally yielded, only to
							prevent the continuance of the War. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin thought that if we told them we had no authority to make the
							concession while intimating to them that we should make it, they might
							insidiously make that the pretext for breaking off. <pb n="193"
								type="ms"/>It was observed that they had already accepted one
							Article, with that Understanding; and therefore could not object to
							taking another on the same footing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin however was unwilling to give them the opportunity— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was still very urgent for holding out
							upon both the points, for the sake of obtaining one.— I said that the
							result of our measure was altogether conjectural— It was possible that
							concession upon one point, would obtain concession upon another more
							easily than resistance upon both— Our experience had been rather in
							favour of this anticipation— For the greatest concessions that we had
							obtained, were immediately after we had agreed to the Indian Article— We
							adjourned from one to three O’Clock; for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin to finish his draft, after this discussion— I walked round the
							City, and part of the Coupure; where I met M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard walking— I returned with him— He said he had been
							reflecting upon this Moose-Island question until he had convinced
							himself that the British were right in their pretension.— Their
							possession was a lawful possession—though taken in time of War, they did
							not claim to hold it by the right of Conquest, but by their own title,
							of which they say we had wrongfully dispossessed them— On the same
							principle they might have refused to leave the question to reference,
							and have insisted upon keeping it as their own— I admitted that they
							might— But if they fairly and honestly waved all claim of conquest they
							could not pretend that their title was unquestionable— They knew on the
							contrary that our claim was strong, they certainly never would otherwise
							have agreed to the reference— But when they did agree to refer, it was
							begging the very question in dispute, to retain possession as upon a
							valid title— It was also manifestly inconsistent with the Status ante
							Bellum— As to the lawfulness of the possession; all possession taken in
							War was lawful— Their possession of Moose-Island was no more or less
							lawful than ours of Fort Erie. He had made a distinction too, which the
							British Plenipotentiaries had attempted to take, that the War had been
								<hi rend="italic">declared</hi> by us—as if the rights of either
							Nation could be affected by the question which party <hi rend="italic"
								>declared</hi> the War— No such distinction was acknowledged by the
							Law of Nations— The rights of the two parties were precisely the same,
							and it was one of the worst features in the practice of the British
							Nation that they always began war without declaring it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard admitted this, but said it did not
							at-all affect the argument— He said that the War would wean vast numbers
							of people in America from their attachments to England; and that British
							influence would never again be so powerful in America as it had been.— I
							called upon <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> as we were returning
							home; at three O’Clock we met by adjournment, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had got his draft ready; with a
							clause of an Article to propose relative to Moose Island— After some
							further discussion it was agreed that we should successively take and
							examine M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s new draft, and meet
							again to-morrow morning finally to decide upon it— We all dined with the
							British Plenipotentiaries— There was no other company present; and the
							party was more than usually dull, stiff and reserved.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn attempted to be courteous, and
							told me he hoped I should pay a visit to England after we have finished
							here— I said I certainly should if they would permit me. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had some conversation with him, and
							with Lord Gambier— He expressed a wish that we could come to a
							conclusion without a new reference to England, which I believe to be
							impossible. Lord Gambier impressed him with the belief that they would
							ultimately insist upon our subscribing to an Article abandoning our
							claim by the Treaty of 1783. to the fisheries within British
							Jurisdiction— Lord Gambier said to him that we surely could not rely
							upon that as a right. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he did
							not wish to enter upon that discussion— Lord Gambier said that if we
							should not make the stipulation, our fishermen would continue the
							practice, and that would produce a new quarrel—that there had been many
							complaints against our fishermen, and representations made, to which the
							British Government were obliged to pay attention. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay therefore wished us to reconsider our
							determination, and still to insist upon both the open points for the
							sake of obtaining the concession upon one.— It appears to me by his own
							account of his Conversation with Lord Gambier, and particularly by
							declining to discuss our claim of right upon the construction of the
							Treaty, he gave our adversaries encouragement to adhere upon the point
							of the fisheries as well as upon the other— We came home between eight
							and nine in the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>14. V.— </date>Began upon the Journal of the day before yesterday,
							and wrote until eleven, the hour of <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james">our
								Mission</persRef> Meeting, which was again held in my chamber. I had
							proposed several alterations, chiefly erasures from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s new draft of the Note to the
								<persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>. The most important was one in which he
							expressed our willingness to agree to an Article for negotiating
							hereafter concerning the Mississippi Navigation, and the American <hi
								rend="italic">liberties</hi> in the fisheries, provided our claim to
							those liberties, by our Construction of the Treaty of 1783 should be in
							no wise considered as impaired thereby— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard had proposed an additional amendment stating that we were <pb
								n="194" type="ms"/>forbidden by our Instructions to enter upon a
							discussion respecting the fisheries— I had intended to propose the same
							amendment, but omitted it merely from an apprehension that it would not
							be adopted— I supported that proposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard; but he himself did not, and it was not admitted— The passage
							which I wished to be stricken out was also retained, and others inserted
							expressly and explicitly with the view ultimately to give up the point
							if necessary— I contended for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s
							amendment and for erasing the passages which I thought objectionable, as
							long as argument could have any effect— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Russell at length said that he would insist for the fisheries as long as
							possible; but he would sooner give them up than continue the War for
							them— I appealed again to our Instructions, and shewed them to him— He
							said he understood them as referring only to the general right; and not
							to the liberties within the British Jurisdiction. I asked him how they
							would be construed by our Country men after we should have given them
							up? He said he supposed some would construe them as I did, and some as
							he did. He supposed there would be a great clamour about it; but that
							must be disregarded. He believed it more for the interest of the Country
							to give up the point rather than continue the War to maintain it— I
							finally told my Colleagues, that I saw the difference between them and
							me was that they had determined ultimately to give up the point and I
							had not. I believed the ground we had originally taken to be good and
							solid.— I could make no distinction between the different Articles of
							the Treaty of 1783. If I admitted this day that a half of one of its
							Articles was abrogated by the War, I should give the enemy an argument
							to say to-morrow that the other half is abrogated equally— If we gave up
							the Liberty to day we might be called to give up the right to-morrow—
							Our Instructions were in general terms— They authorised no such
							distinction as that now made; and no new Instruction concerning the
							fisheries has been given us since our Government knows the pretension of
							Great-Britain— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he had
							always thought our ground upon that point untenable—that I had now
							almost a majority against me; and he did not wish we should commit
							ourselves to any thing precluding us from abandoning our ground at
							last.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell said that he considered
							every thing of a permanent Nature, and founded on natural right in the
							Treaty of 1783. as not affected by a subsequent War; but privileges
							granted by the Treaty, and which we should not have enjoyed without it,
							he thought were abrogated by War— I said there was no grant of new
							privileges in the Treaty— The liberties as well as the rights were
							merely a continuation of what had always been enjoyed— It was necessary
							for the fishermen to go to the parts of the coast frequented by the
							fish, and when by the Independence of the United States it became a
							foreign Jurisdiction, we had a right to reserve the liberty of
							continuing to fish there, and the circumstance of the Jurisdiction alone
							occasioned the change of the expression— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay said he did not wish to make up his mind upon the subject, untill
							it should be absolutely necessary. He saw we should make a damned bad
							Treaty, and he did not know whether he would sign it or not— But he
							could draw in five minutes an Article agreeing to negotiate concerning
							the Mississippi and the fisheries, without impairing our claim to them
							by the Treaty of 1783. he drew an Article accordingly, which I read and
							told him I had no other objection to it than that it would be instantly
							rejected by the British Plenipotentiaries— I further said that as they
							were all determined at last to yield the fishery point I thought they
							were wrong not to give it up now, and sign the Treaty without another
							reference to England; as well as without my signature— I could not sign
							it, because I could not consent to give up that point— But if I were of
							their opinion, I would make sure of the Treaty now— They were setting
							every thing afloat by another reference; and it was errant trifling to
							be still cavilling about a point upon which they had resolved ultimately
							to yield— They said they preferred making one effort more; and the Note
							was adjusted and given to <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef> to be copied fair and
							taken to the British Plenipotentiaries— We adjourned from half past one
							to half past three O’Clock, when we met again at my chamber, and signed
							the Note— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell came in after the rest
							of us had signed and when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes had
							already gone in search of him— I told him again I thought they were
							wrong in not making sure of the Treaty now if they had resolved to give
							up the fishery question at last— I said I felt myself under peculiar
							obligations to defend this interest, besides those, incumbent upon the
							other members of the Mission. He said he supposed it was because
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> had obtained them
							before— I said I could not be insensible to that consideration; but that
							was not all— It was an interest in which the people of Massachusetts
							were exclusively concerned— As a Citizen of Massachusetts I owed a duty
							to the State, distinct from that which we all owed to it as a member of
							the Union— I was called upon to make a double sacrifice, both in this
							and the Moose-Island question, and it had placed me in one of the most
							painful dilemmas I had ever experienced. He said he was now a Citizen of
							Massachusetts also; though <pb n="195" type="ms"/>though he was not born
							there— That he should yield upon these points with extreme reluctance,
							and should be sorry to lose my signature to the Treaty— But he did not
							think we could continue the war, for them.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hughes carried the Note, and <persRef ref="baker-anthony"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baker</persRef> wrote him a

								<persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							begun, they had in the Hall itself a counter-order, and stayed.—
							Meulemeester also said to me that coming to Europe had been of great
							service to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— Un Siècle en arrière,
							said he, n’est ce pas?— I did not confirm him in his opinion— From M<hi

							which is described and painted in <persRef ref="leclerc-george"
								>Buffon’s</persRef> natural history— This one is about six feet
							high, ten feet long, and weighs 4800 pounds. His horn had fallen off
							about three months ago, and a new one is now growing out. The same thing
							had happened to the other when I saw him— The keeper told us that the
							horn fell one in three or four years like the antlers of a stag.— He
							also told us that he could run, as fleet as a horse, which from his size
							and unwieldy form, the shape and shortness of his legs I think
							impossible— It is the most deformed and hideous of quadrupeds, and has
							particularly the most misshapen head— The ears are like those of the
							Ass, and the eyes certainly not bigger than those of a swine. The horn
							is in the centre of the forehead, and the eyes far below it almost at
							the end of the snout— It is a graminivorous animal, and the keeper told
							us that he eats 160 lb of hay daily, besides rye bread and oats.— He is
							quite tame— After seeing him I walked with M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rossiell</persRef>.
							The carding and spinning of the cotton is done by the operation of a
							steam engine. The works are extensive in one large building of five
							Stories. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rossiell regrets the French
							Government, and is abhorrent of the English, whose competition ruins the
							manufactures of this Country— His among the rest.— Not half of his
							machines are now employed— He says he told the <persRef ref="william-i"
								>Prince of Orange</persRef>—“When we were French, they were all at
							work, Night and day”— I went afterwards with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cornelissen, and saw the Library of a <persRef
								ref="lammens-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lammens</persRef>, who lives in the house of one of the old
							suppressed Convents, the Dominicans— The collection of books is large
							and valuable, but with scarcely any modern books— After returning home,
							I walked round the Coupure, and as I was coming back met in the Street
								<persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bayard</persRef>, who told me that the answer from the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, to our last Note had been received—
							That it accepted our proposal to say nothing in the Treaty about the
							fisheries or the Navigation of the <pb n="197" type="ms"/>Mississippi,
							and indeed placed the remaining points of controversy at our own
							disposal. As soon as I came in to my chamber, <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> brought me the Note. It agrees to be silent upon
							the Navigation of the Mississippi, and the fisheries, and to strike out
							the whole of the eighth Article, marking the boundary from the Lake of
							the Woods westward. They also refer again to their declaration of the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August, that Great-Britain would
							not hereafter grant the liberty of fishing and drying and curing fish
							within the exclusive British Jurisdiction, without an equivalent— They
							accepted our proposed paragraph respecting the Islands in
							Passamaquoddy-Bay, with the exception of a clause for their restitution
							if the contested title to them, should not be settled within a limited
							time— Instead of which they gave a declaration that no unnecessary delay
							of the settlement should be interposed by Great-Britain— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin asked me whether I thought, as
							they had referred to their declaration of 8 August, concerning the
							fisheries, it would be necessary to write a note, referring again to our
							Construction of the Treaty of 1783. and to our right to the fisheries
							under it.— I said that as we had twice stated it and in terms peculiarly
							strong in our last Note, I did not think any further written declaration
							upon the subject necessary. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							asked me to write immediately a Note to <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd</persRef>, requesting him to be
							himself, and to direct the Captain of the Transit to be ready to start
							at a moments notice, which I did— <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> soon after came into my
							chamber, and on reading the British Note, manifested some Chagrin— He
							still talked of breaking off the Negotiation, but he did not exactly
							disclose the motive of his ill-humour, which was however easily seen
							through.— He would have much preferred the proposed 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> Article with the proposed British
							paragraph, formally admitting that the British right to navigate the
							Mississippi, and the American right to the fisheries within British
							Jurisdiction were both abrogated by the War. I think his conversation
							with Lord Gambier on the subject last week, at their dinner the day
							before we sent our Note, had the tendency to induce the British to
							adhere to their paragraph, and that Clay is disappointed at their having
							given it up.— And he has so entire an ascendancy over <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>, though a New-England man, and claiming to be a
							Massachusetts-Man that Russell repeatedly told me last week, when I
							assured him that I would not sign the Treaty, with an Article admitting
							that our right to any part of the fisheries was forfeited, that he
							should be sorry to sign a Treaty without me; but that he did not think
							that part of the fisheries an object for which the war should be
							continued— That he was for insisting upon it as long as possible, but
							for giving it up at last if the British would not sign without it—
								<persRef ref="bayard-james">We</persRef> agreed to meet at half-past
							seven O’Clock this Evening— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornelissen
							dined with us— At half-past-seven in the Evening we met, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay continued in his discontented humour—
							He was for taking time to deliberate upon the British Note— He was for
							meeting about it to-morrow Morning; he was sounding all round for
							support in making another stand of resistance at this stage of the
							business— He evidently thought himself sure of Russell’s vote— He said
							that as to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard he knew they were too eager, for
							Peace— At last he turned to me and asked me, whether I would not join
							him now, and break off the Negotiation— I told him no— It was now too
							late— I had offered to break off on the Indian Article, which he had not
							chosen to do— There was nothing now to break off upon— Well! said he;
							will you be of the same opinion to-morrow?—perhaps not, said I; but you
							can easily ascertain; by asking the question again to-morrow.— Gallatin
							and Bayard, who appeared not to know where it was that Clay’s shoe
							pinched him, were astonished at what they heard, and Gallatin shewed
							some impatience, at what he thought mere unseasonable trifling— He said
							at last that he had no objection to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay’s amusing himself in that way, as long as he thought proper— But as
							soon as he should chuse to be serious, he Gallatin would propose that
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> should be requested to call this Evening upon the
							British Plenipotentiaries, and ask a conference with them for
							to-morrow.— Clay was still for taking time, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Russell, called for the vote— He put the question himself, I
							suppose to avoid voting himself— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and myself voted to ask for
							the Conference, and Clay voted against it— After the meeting adjourned I
							went and passed an hour at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi

								>We</persRef> were to meet this morning at eleven O’Clock previous
							to the Conference— <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef> sent me a note to say
							that the <persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef> would meet us at twelve O’Clock
							at our own house. I was engaged until the time of meeting in writing to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; and of
							course my work of copying must again be suspended for several days. We
							met before twelve, and <pb n="198" type="ms"/>agreed upon the manner of
							opening the conference. The British Plenipotentiaries came at the
							appointed time, and when we were seated I informed them that we had
							determined to accept the proposals, contained in the Note we had
							yesterday received from them—that we had asked for the conference to
							make the final arrangements for the conclusion of the Treaty, and should
							be ready to sign it, whenever it would be agreeable to them— Lord
							Gambier expressed his satisfaction that the Negotiation had been brought
							to this favourable result; and we proceeded to make the definitive
							amendments for completing the Treaty.— <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef> read the Protocol of
							the last conference which was very short— We have at all the late
							meetings taken the Protocol, as drawn by them. In the first Article they
							agreed to fix the cessation of hostilities, and the consequences of that
							event, from the ratification of the Treaty by both parties, instead of
							leaving it, from the exchange of the Ratifications— They consented to
							execute triplicate copies of the Treaty, upon either of which the
							Ratification, in the United States, might be given— But as the
							Great-Seal of England could be affixed only to one Ratification, and as
							the American Ratification could be given in Exchange only for that, if
							any accident should befall it, the hostilities might be continued for
							several months on a mere formality— But in agreeing to date the
							cessation of hostilities from the ratification, and not from the
							exchange, the British Plenipotentiaries insisted upon inserting words
							importing that it should be a ratification without alterations; because
							they said the American Government sometimes ratified Treaties with<hi
								rend="strikethrough">out</hi> exceptions— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin said that those were not ratifications at all—that
							they were merely the advice and consent of the Senate to the President
							to ratify with the exception— If the other contracting party did not
							consent to the exception there was no ratification— They still however
							insisted upon having the words— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							proposed to them the words “in manner and form as herein
							contained[”]—but they preferred the words “without alteration by either
							of the contracting parties,[”] and they were inserted— The first Article
							was also definitively settled in regard to the restitution of captured
							territory and the exception of the Islands in Passamaquoddy Bay— After
							making several successive amendments in the Article concerning the
							restoration of vessels captured at Sea, after the peace, it was thought
							best to present it in a new draft, saying [“]the Article was altered so
							as to read as follows.”— This proposition was made by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin. We took the Article offered by
							the British Plenipotentiaries as the basis; and they agreed to the
							alterations shortening the times, and extending the Latitudes and
							Longitudes as proposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin.— The
							Article concerning the release of prisoners, proposed on the British
							side, it was agreed should stand as the third.— The <hi rend="italic"
								>Exchange</hi> of Ratifications was the date from which the release
							was to take place, and it was first proposed to let it so stand— I
							remarked that in case of the accident to the Ratification from England,
							against which it was our object to guard, the operation of the Article
							as it stood, would be to prevent the release for some Months, of the
							British prisoners in America— Upon which the British Plenipotentiaries
							desired the alteration in this Article, to make it correspond with the
							others which was done. There was a provision for the repayment of the
							advances, made by each Government for the sustenance and maintenance of
							prisoners taken from the other; and the words in specie were interlined—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that all the advances
							made by the British Government for American prisoners had been in paper—
							He did not suppose they wished to make ten or twelve per Cent on the
							repayment— He thought those words should be struck out— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said that their paper was not
							depretiated— That some of their payments were made in specie— That all
							their troops in America were paid in Specie, and all their advances for
							Prisoners should be in specie at Halifax— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard proposed that the repayment should be in the same currency in
							which it was paid— The British Plenipotentiaries, preferred the payment
							in Specie, on account of its simplicity. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Adams said we had ourselves offered an Article in which it was proposed
							to be made in Specie; but that Article was rejected, and had it been
							accepted the payment would have been of sums to be awarded by
							Commissioners for indemnities, and the awards would have been made with
								<pb n="199" type="ms"/>a full consideration of the mode of
							payment—but here was to be a repayment in specie for a payment in Paper,
							under a discount of ten per Cent or more— The British Plenipotentiaries
							however persisted, until M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he
							thought it was not worth while to say any more about it— I proposed to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to request that the motion
							to strike out the words should be inserted on this day’s protocol; but
							he said no—that he thought a paper payment in England must pass for the
							stipulated payment in specie— There is nothing that more distinctly
							characterizes the temper &amp; Spirit, of the British Plenipotentiaries
							in this negotiation than this artifice to filch a profit of fifteen or
							twenty per Cent, upon a sum of perhaps fifty thousands pounds Sterling,
							and their inflexible adherence to it— The other alterations were of no
							material consequence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed a
							slight one in the Article concerning the abolition of the Slave-trade,
							which was adopted. After all the other points were settled, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn brought forward again the
							proposed Article, stipulating that the Courts of each Country should be
							open to the suitors of the other. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin said that it would have no operation— That as we had in
							abandoning the Article of Indemnities reserved the claims for those
							which be due for damages suffered prior to the war, we relied upon
							having access to the British Courts, although the same object might also
							be treated of between the two Governments. That our own Courts would be
							equally open to British Subjects and we had thought our declaration to
							that effect in our Note would be equivalent to an Article in the Treaty—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said that for the Government
							and for him it would be sufficient— But in the Office to which he
							belonged, (the Colonial department) he was very often troubled with
							persons who came with complaints on the Subject, and he wanted to have
							an answer to give them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said that
							as the Courts of the United States, would of course be open to British
							Subjects without any such Article, and as it would be known that the
							British Courts would also without stipulation be open to our Citizens,
							it was to be apprehended that our judges, inferring that the Article
							must be intended for some thing would affix to it a meaning different
							from that intended and a constructive operation which is not meant— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn said that if we definitively
							objected to it, they must give it up—but it would be quite a
							gratification to them to have it— I observed that I had another
							objection, which I did not wish to be understood as expressing for any
							of my Colleagues, but for myself alone— It would be known by all the
							world that such an Article would have no sort of operation in England—
							It would therefore be understood as being unilateral—applying only to
							the United States; and would thus bring an imputation upon them which
							they did not deserve, and which I was not willing to expose them to—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn at last requested if we
							would not admit the Article, that it should be entered on the protocol
							as having been demanded by them, and objected to, by us—to which we
							agreed. The Conference was of about three hours, and terminated by an
							agreement that we should meet at three O’Clock to-morrow afternoon at
							the house of the British Plenipotentiaries, for the purpose of signing
							and sealing the six copies of the Treaty; three copies to be made by us
							to be delivered to them, and three by them to be delivered to us— They
							told us that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker would go off with the
							Treaty to-morrow Evening for England with one copy of the Treaty; and
							that he was to go out to America, with the English Ratification. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay proposed to us that we should send
							out <persRef ref="carroll-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef>, his private Secretary with one of the Copies; and
							he asked the British Plenipotentiaries, if there would be any objection
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll’s going out in the same vessel
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker— They thought there would not,
							and promised to recommend it, to their Government— After the adjournment
							of the Conference, it was agreed that a dispatch to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> should be written to
							go with the Treaty— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes promised to
							have two copies of the Treaty ready by three O’Clock to-morrow
							afternoon, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay promised to make one
							copy for him— We made a short dinner, and I was engaged until ten at
							Night in making the draft of a dispatch to the Secretary of State. I
							took it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s chamber, but he was
							gone out.</p>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams had our three copies comparing them in like manner—
							There was a variation between the Copies, merely verbal, which arose
							from the writing at full length on both sides the dates which in the
							drafts were in arithmetical figures. All our Copies had the Treaty of
							Peace of seventeen hundred and eighty-three— All the British Copies had
							it one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three— There was the same
							difference in the date of the signature of this Treaty. It was not
							thought necessary to alter either of them— A few mistakes in the Copies
							were rectified and then the six Copies were signed and sealed by the
							three British and the five American Plenipotentiaries— Lord Gambier
							delivered to me the three British Copies, and I delivered to him the
							three American Copies of the Treaty, which he said he hoped would be
							permanent; and I told him I hoped it would be the last Treaty of Peace

							six O’Clock. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker had a Carriage in the
							yard, waiting for him, to start for Ostend where there is a vessel in
							readiness to take him over to England— It was agreed that the signature
							of the Treaty should not be divulged here until to-morrow Noon, so that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker may have an opportunity to

							since he returned from London.— The Danish frigate, the Pearl, which was
							to have gone to England there to take him and the other Danish
							Commissioners to receive the Danish West India Islands, is lost. She
							sailed at first from Copenhagen, and returned dismasted— She sailed a

							this day received the news of this last Event, and that he must now go
							to England there to find a passage to the West-Indies as he could. I
							asked him when he should go— He said to morrow, or perhaps this Night—
							He lingered with us some time after dinner, and then went to M<hi

							of which was liable to be abrogated by the subsequent War— M<hi

								rend="italic">thought</hi> it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell made out the fair copy of the
							dispatch to be sent; on reading it over to compare it with the original
							draft and amendments I perceived this alteration, and immediately
							objected to it. I insisted upon substituting the word <hi rend="italic"
								>must</hi> for <hi rend="italic">might</hi>—to read we contended the
							Treaty of 1783 <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be considered &amp;c. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard agreed to this amendment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay were gone to dine at <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Caneghem’s</persRef>;
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes came to take the despatches to
							them there to be signed— I shewed him the alteration, and desired him to
							give notice of it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay before he
							should sign the dispatch— Hughes took up the despatch, read it over, and
							exclaimed in a great passion—there now! my name is not once mentioned in
							the whole Letter— I looked it over, and said coolly it was not; but that
							it was mentioned in my separate Letter to the Secretary of State— I
							assure you said he <pb n="201" type="ms"/>that it (meaning the omission)
							takes away great part of my satisfaction in being the bearer of the
							Treaty— Neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard nor myself made
							him any reply— Bayard asked me after he was gone, what he could mean— I
							said I supposed he meant we should have introduced into our despatch a
							high-flown Commendation of his Merits— Bayard said that it would have
							made both him and ourselves ridiculous. Hughes renewed his complaint at
							Van Caneghem’s to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, who told him that
							if it was proper to mention him by name, it was not too late; but he
							believed it was not usual in diplomatic dispatches, though customary in
							military affairs. Hughes wrote me from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Van Caneghem’s that upon his advice he had concluded with the
							approbation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, to start at 4. O’Clock to-morrow
							Morning— About 8 in the Evening we had every thing in readiness for him,
							and delivered to him all his despatches. I then went to the <persRef
								ref="dhanedesteenhuyse-jean">Intendant’s</persRef> where I found
							assembled a party of about one hundred and twenty persons, almost all at
							Cards— We received the Congratulations of the Intendant and his family,
							and of many others, upon the signature of the Peace, and frequently with
							expressions of pleasure that its conditions were understood to be
							advantageous to us— The party broke up about ten in the Evening.— We
							received shortly after dinner a Note from the Intendant, informing us
							that he had just received an official communication of the conclusion of
							the Peace; and inviting us to dine with him on Wednesday next to
							celebrate the Event— We had however invited the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> to dine with us on that day.— <persRef
								ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> had
							company at his chambers this day; and at twelve O’Clock announced to
							them the conclusion of the Peace— <persRef ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornelissen</persRef> who was present,
							afterwards gave notice of it at the Exchange.</p>

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef>; and as we have reason to believe the Herald will
							be prevented by the ice from sailing from Amsterdam, I wrote to <persRef
								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef> requesting him to inform us if there should be
							soon any other opportunity from England, to send dispatches to the

								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, to enable him to Land in England
							without having his despatches taken from him. D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Adams told him they could not give one; that such was the

							the first nobleman of the Country— But Lord Gambier thought they might

							Just before he went away, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll told

							that Carroll, during the whole time he had been with him had possessed
							his entire Confidence, and recommending him in very strong terms as
							Secretary of Legation either to England or France— M<hi

							We had a meeting of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>Mission</persRef> in my Chamber at one O’Clock— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had suggested last Friday,
							immediately after we had come to the agreement to sign the Treaty of
							Peace, that we ought to make to the British Government an official <pb
								n="202" type="ms"/>communication of our full-power, to negotiate a
							Treaty of Commerce— The proposition was now renewed, and after some
							discussion it was agreed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							should make a draft of a Note for that purpose. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard proposed that <persRef ref="jones-reuben">Captain
								Reuben Jones</persRef>, an American Citizen now at Dunkirk should be
							dispatched as a special messenger with the third copy of the
							Treaty;—that he should be written to for that purpose, and dispatched by
							the Herald— I made some objections, it being probable that the departure
							of the Herald will be prevented by the ice— This Captain Jones wrote
							about a month ago to the mission, requesting to be sent as bearer of
							dispatches, if we should need one— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Bayard received the letter, and has kept it to this day, without
							communicating it to the mission— An inadvertence which has occurred
							several times, with regard to letters of little importance— This subject
							was not definitively decided this day— The subject of an answer to the
							Note from the <persRef ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william"
								>British Plenipotentiaries</persRef> of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> instant respecting the Sale of Negroes taken from the
							Southern States, in the West-Indies was further considered. I proposed
							that the Peace being now made, we should send a copy of the affidavit,
							furnished us by the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>— This was opposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay, and he engaged to make a draft of an answer, referring it to the
							American Government to give or to withhold the proof requested.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had made a minute of the objects
							still to be determined upon by the mission; and among them was the
							disposal of the Books, Maps, other effects and Papers— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed that the Books and other
							Articles except the papers should be packed up and sent to <persRef
								ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beasley</persRef> for the use of the Mission to London hereafter—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought they ought to be sent by
							the Neptune to the Department of State— Then came the question about the
							Papers— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay was very earnest to have
							them with him in the Neptune, because he had no copies of them at-all,
							and he thought they ought to be deposited in the Department of State,
							where he could have access to them hereafter— He said they might
							hereafter be interesting as historical records, and the Department of
							State was the proper place for them— I said that according to the usage
							in similar cases, and the precedent in the case of the former mission I
							considered that the custody of the papers, would at the termination of
							the mission devolve upon me, subject to the orders of our Government—
							And I should take charge of them accordingly— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay immediately kindled into a flame, and said that he
							should both physically and morally revolt at any such pretension—that
							because I happened accidentally to be in possession of the papers, I
							should assert a right to keep them— I said it was not because I was in
							possession of the papers; for I would instantly or at any other time put
							every one of the papers into his possession if he desired it; but I
							should still consider myself entitled to the keeping of them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin declared himself to be of the
							same opinion. It was asked where were the Papers of the prior Mission;
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he had them all; having
							received them from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris the Secretary—
							I mentioned that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin had then
							distributed the papers at his own discretion; and had given to me the
							Full-power to treat of Commerce with Russia, and to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard the powers to treat of Peace and of
							Commerce with Great Britain— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he
							did not pay any regard to the precedent of the former Mission, and knew
							nothing about the usage— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell called
							for its being put to vote— I said I should not put it to vote; not
							considering it as a point to be decided by a vote. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay seemed to consider this as arrogating
							a superiority over the other members of the mission—as a claim of
							prerogative at which he was excessively indignant— He said it was well
							known the circumstance of my being first named in the mission was merely
							accidental; I said I was perfectly sensible of that; and had any other
							person been first named I should have considered him as entitled to the
							custody of the papers after the termination of the mission.— I claimed
							nothing but what I had acquiesced in when I was not the first named of
							the Mission— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin proposed to leave
							the subject for further consideration hereafter, which was done— After
							dispatching my Letters for S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, I
							spent part of the Evening at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s</persRef> lodgings.</p>

							God-Save the king; and immediately after it Hail-Columbia! Lord Gambier
							immediately proposed as a toast “the United States of America[”]— I
							requested his permission previously to give <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>His Britannic Majesty</persRef> to which he assented— Both the

							<persRef ref="william-i">Sovereign Prince of the

							National air, but they sent me word they did not know it— The Intendant
							then desired to give a toast, and gave the Congress at Ghent, in return
							for which we gave the City of Ghent, and its prosperity— We left the
							table about 8 O’Clock and had one Card table for the Intendant’s Lady—

							had met this morning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams and given them the information.
								D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Adams said that their Powers were

							Clay brought forward again the subject of the Books, Maps, effects and
							papers belonging to the Mission; and expressed his opinion that they
							ought all to be sent to the Department of State by the Neptune— He had,
							he said no copies of the Papers; he did not like the trouble of copying—
							He wished therefore the papers might be in a place where he could have
							access to them, if he should have occasion; and they might be hereafter
							useful as historical archives— It would be convenient to him to have
							them in the Neptune; and it could be no inconvenience to me as by my
							laudable Industry I had taken copies of all the papers— I said I had
							taken copies of a part of the papers received from the <persRef
								ref="gambier-james;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, but not of any of the Papers received
							from the Department of State, for the very reason that I had considered
							it unquestionable that they would remain with me.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he thought it would be
							ridiculous to send back to the Department of State, Instructions and
							Papers sent from that Department to us— That when there was only one
							person in a Mission there could be no question in the case— The
							Ministers <pb n="204" type="ms"/>from the United-States invariably kept
							the papers addressed to them; but as in a Commission of five persons,
							every member could not have them, he thought that in propriety and
							according to general usage they should be left with the first named
							member of the Mission.— I referred again to the precedent of the former
							mission; which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay said again he
							considered as Nothing— I replied that I must consider it as something,
							because it was then unanimous, and the three members of that mission
							formed a majority of the present one— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard took no part in this debate, but made some observations to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clay, in a separate Conversation, which I
							did not hear— He then asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin what
							was done with the Papers of the former Mission— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin said that he had taken all the papers with him to
							the time he had withdrawn from the Mission, and they were in one of his
							trunks on board the Neptune— That there was but one dispatch from the
							Department of State received after they arrived in S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg; that of 23. June 1813. of
							which we all had originals— I added that the day before they left S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin had given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
							the full-powers to treat of Peace and Commerce with Great-Britain, and

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay however still recurring to his right,
							I said I supposed he would at least acknowledge that I had an <hi
								rend="italic">equal</hi> right with himself—he said, yes, he
							admitted that— I then said that I would deliver up the papers to any
							person, named to me in writing, by a majority of the mission, and
							authorized to give me a receipt for them— The papers which I should
							deliver being also specified— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said
							he would draw up <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a paper, and we passed to
							another subject— No vote or Resolution was passed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard at least in my hearing did not give
							an opinion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell said to me “I believe
							I should be against you upon the principle,” and added “but I shall not
							vote to have the papers taken out of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Adams’s hands, to be put into those of <hi rend="italic">any other
								member of the Mission</hi>.” I expected another discussion when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s draft of the requisition to me
							should be presented for consideration.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard again brought forward the proposal for dispatching the third Copy
							of the Treaty— I have a letter from <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourne</persRef>, mentioning that the
							Herald is fast locked up by the Ice. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard now proposed that <persRef ref="jones-reuben">Captain Reuben
								Jones</persRef>, should be sent with the Treaty, to England, to take
							passage by the first opportunity that shall occur— I objected to the
							expence, and said we should have to maintain him all the time he should
							be waiting to go; besides his travelling expences— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said we might limit him to a
							particular sum and proposed to give him the same that had been allowed
							to <persRef ref="carroll-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef>—£150 Sterling— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Russell proposed £120, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard
							promised to write to Jones who was supposed to be at Dunkirk, directing
							him to come immediately here, if the terms should suit him.— The
							remainder of the morning until dinner time I was engaged in removing
							from the Hotel de Lovendeghem, Rue des Champs, to the Hotel des
							Pays-Bas, on the Place d’Armes, where I took the chamber N. 16— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, and his Son <persRef ref="gallatin-james">James</persRef>, and
							myself dined there together at 1/2 past 4. In the Evening we all went to
							a Concert and Ball at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								De Naeyer’s</persRef>, to which we had been invited— The
							performances of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Naeyer</persRef> on the Harp and of <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Ramond</persRef> on the Piano were very excellent— The singing not
							so good; but Miss Ramond with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Denaeyer,
							and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van der
								Vliet</persRef> sung a trio from the Matrimonio Segreto of <persRef
								ref="cimarosa-domenico">Cimarosa</persRef> which was amusing— I
							played at whist with a couple of old Ladies one of whom asked me in what
							part of England I resided— Returned to my lodgings between ten and
							eleven in the Evening— We received this day a Note from the British
							Plenipotentiaries, in answer to our last; and informing us that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll would be allowed to go out to
							America in the same Vessel with <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>— Also that a Duplicate
							of the British Ratification under the great seal would be sent— As M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell intends to leave the City
							to-morrow Morning for Paris, I was much engaged in preparing a dispatch
							for the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, and an
							answer to a Letter from <persRef ref="vonbrockhausen-karl">Baron
								Brockhausen</persRef>, the Prussian Minister at the Hague, for him
							to sign. The draft of this answer was made yesterday by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin while we were in Session— I made
							considerable alterations of it, with his approbation, and this Evening
							wrote it off to be ready for signature.</p>

							his chamber. <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> came about one O’Clock to my chamber; and delivered
							to me an open Letter, signed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
							himself and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, dated yesterday, and
							requesting me, in conformity with the Resolution of the majority of the
							Mission of the same day, to cause to be packed up all the Books, Maps,
							and other Articles purchased at the public expence for the use of the
							Mission; as also all the original Notes, papers, and communications
							received from the British Government, from the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">British Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, and from
							other persons; and to cause the whole to be transmitted to the Neptune,
							at the public expence, to be carried to America and deposited with the
							Department of State. After reading this paper I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that it was very unexpected to
							me—that I had not been aware that any vote or Resolution of a Majority
							of the Mission had been adopted yesterday— He said that I could not say
							so with truth— That after we had finished our business here, he did not
							wish to part at enmity with any person—that if the leaving of the papers
							with me had been put on the footing of courtesy, it would have been a
							different thing; but he could not admit my right to keep the papers
							merely because I accidentally had possession of them— I said that there
							certainly had been no vote or resolution yesterday upon the subject—
							That my claim to keep the papers was not founded upon my accidental
							possession of them— I had made him the offer, and would now repeat it to
							put every one of the papers into his hands if he desired it; but that
							the question would remain precisely the same— That as to parting in
							enmity I saw no sort of reason for that— It was merely a question with
							regard to the disposal of the papers— He had one opinion, I had another,
							I saw no sort of necessity, for any further difference between us
							because we differed upon that— It was not a mere act of courtesy that I
							required. It was a claim founded upon what I conceived to be the usage,
							and with which I had acquiesced in the case of the former mission— I
							asked nothing but what I had granted— It was not a point of Law— It was
							very true as he had said that my being first named in the full-powers
							was accidental— But that accident as I conceived had assigned to me the
							custody of the papers subject to the orders of the Government— There was
							no <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, which authorized me to sign my name the
							first, merely because I was first named in the full-powers— If in any of
							the Dispatches or papers we had signed, he had insisted upon signing his
							name before mine, I knew of no <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, that would
							have warranted me in claiming the right of signing first— I considered
							it as resting upon usage, and that the custody of the papers stood on
							precisely the same foundation— This illustration appeared to nettle him,
							for it conveyed to him my sense of his whole procedure— A piece of
							chicanery upon a trifle— Appeals to Law, and Right upon an object not
							worth a straw— The pretence that I am arrogating prerogative and
							superiority, because I claim as the first named member of a mission, the
							custody of its papers, subject to the orders of the Government—
							Cavilling upon a Bagatelle; merely because it would be convenient to
							himself to have the papers— As to the precedent of the former Mission,
							he said that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard did not agree in their account of
							it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard did not admit that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had the papers; and it appeared
							to him, Clay, utterly absurd that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin should have kept them— After the rejection of his nomination by
							the Senate he had not even been a member of the mission— I said that
							only proved that my claim now was stronger than his could be then— That
							the fact was so. He had distributed the papers <hi rend="italic">at his
								discretion</hi>, and his distribution had been acquiesced in without
							discussion by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard and myself— I
							finally told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I should take the
							paper which he had brought me into Consideration, and act upon it as I
							should think proper.— We all dined at <persRef ref="vanaken-norbert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norbert van Aken’s</persRef>,
							the brother of <persRef ref="meulemeester-therese">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Meulemeester</persRef>— He is the
							President of the tribunal of Commerce, and has been the Banker of the
							British Legation— They were all there— I came home about nine in the
							Evening.</p>
