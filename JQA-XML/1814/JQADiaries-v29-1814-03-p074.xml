							the examinations of the Young Ladies who have completed their Education
							there, and are now about leaving the school. It was in all respects
							similar to that which I attended at the same place, three years ago,
							excepting that the examination in experimental philosophy was omitted,
							the teacher in that department having been long ill. The examinations in
							the German Language, Arithmetick, French Literature, Grammar, Logick,
							and Rhetorick were short— The most trying of the Exercises, was the
							translation of passages from a French Book, opened at Random by the
							visitors; and of which a few Sentences were read into Russian by several
							of the young Ladies. The music and the dancing took up at least three
							fourths of the time. The whole examination was finished about 2 in the
							afternoon— The works in Embroidery, artificial flowers, Carpet-work, and
							drawing were exposed as usual, and all done in the ordinary style of
							perfection— There was a Cold Collation served in one of the outer Halls—
							Of the two most distinguished of the young Ladies who exhibited, one was
							a french name, <persRef ref="u">Mademoiselle Prévot de Lumian</persRef>;
							and the other a German, <persRef ref="u">Engelbach</persRef>.— The first
							was most remarked for her beauty, and elegant accomplishments— The
							other, less handsome, was nearly as conspicuous in the literary
							exercises, and surpassed all the rest in the specimens of needle-work,
							tapestry, and embroidery— The crowd both in going and returning was
							impassible— The heat oppressive— No other of the foreign Ministers was
							there but <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef>; I sat
							near <persRef ref="u">Baron Klinkowström</persRef> and had much

							balances due to me from some persons, and from me to others, when the

								>Malebranche</persRef>, and has <persRef ref="locke-john"

								<hi rend="italic">Intelligence</hi>— It draws closely to the
							absurdities of the Greek Philosophers who thought Water, Air, Fire, and
							what not, God— The Count was particularly harsh upon Locke, for his
							doctrine that we have no innate ideas— He insists that all our ideas are
							innate, and that a child can never learn any thing but what he knows
							already.— He expressed a very mean opinion of Locke’s genius, and said
							he was the origin of all the materialism of the 18<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="kant-immanuel">Kant</persRef>, the German

						<p><date>26. VI. </date>Made some little further progress in my

								>Sully’s</persRef> Memoirs. I read them more than twenty years ago
							in the English Translation, which is not a good one. I find them now
							more interesting; but want the original Edition to see what really
							belongs to Sully, and what to the <persRef ref="delecluse-pierre">abbé
								de L’Ecluse</persRef>— Sully’s Education was imperfect, which I
							suppose was the reason why his Memoirs were so immethodical and
							confused, as to give rise to this transformation of them. He was
							presented in his 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year by <persRef
								ref="debethune-francois">his father</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="henry-iv">Henry 4</persRef>. then King of Navarre, and attached
							himself to him from that time— It was just before Henry’s marriage and
							the massacre of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Bartholomew, from which
							Sully escaped almost by a Miracle. From that time he abandoned all Study
							of the learned Languages, but applied himself assiduously to the
							Mathematics, History, and the Exercises that give strength and grace to
							the body. He was one of those beings so happily constituted by Nature
							that in reading his life it seems as if Virtue itself was a gift of God,
							so entire as to take away all responsibility from human action— His
							personal Courage had so much of rashness in it, in his Youth, that he
							must have perished on many occasions but for that unseen Spirit that
							protects the favourites of Heaven, which we call Fortune. His presence
							of Mind in the midst of danger, was as great and extraordinary as his
							valour; and saved him on many occasions when others must have fallen— He
							had from his childhood a Spirit of order and economy, which became one
							of the firmest Pillars of his greatness, yet blended with a liberality
							which on proper occasions made with cheerfulness the greatest pecuniary
							sacrifices— His controul over the Passion of Love was perhaps to
							complete; for he married by the advice of his Valet de chambre one
								<persRef ref="debethune-anne">Lady</persRef>, while he was deeply in
							love with another; merely because the Lady whom he finally fixed upon,
							was richer and of higher rank than the other. He and his father were
							both believers in judicial Astrology;—and were convinced he was to be a
							great man, because it had been predicted— Indeed from the instances he
							gives of his own genius and discretion, in his infancy, the Astrologers
							needed no supernatural light to foretel his future greatness. There was
							a stubbornness of Resolution, and Perseverance in his Composition which
							I believe indispensable to all truly great characters; but it sometimes
							betrayed him into faults which he candidly acknowledges. There is one
							instance of it at the close of the first Book, which arose upon a point
							of false honour, in which he gave great offence to his Master, and
							deeply aggravated it by persisting in it, with what he himself terms
							insolent language. But his character and that of Henry 4. were so
							exactly adapted to each other that it was impossible for them to be
							permanently separated. Among the reflections which arise from the
							perusal of this Book, the mind can scarcely credit the strange and
							horrible picture of civil Society, which they exhibit— The rapid and
							continual alternations of Peace and War; the mixture of Debauchery and
							Devotion, of Marriage and Massacre, of festive entertainments, and
							pillaged Cities, Treaties made and broken every year, Treachery,
							Assassination, and Poison, all upon the pretext of Religion—bad as is
							this age, that I think was worse.</p>

						<p><date>28. </date>Took <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to
							school in the sleigh, and walked home. I had risen at V:30. and employed
							the first morning hours with my Chronology. Had a morning visit from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman</persRef>,
							who informed me of his intention of going to England. He assured me that
							he had formed no definitive commercial Connection with <persRef
								ref="brown-lawrence">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef>,
							and that if he should <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> would have no
							interest in it, at least before the Peace— He also told me that from the
							time the American trade here had declined in 1812, untill within a week
							before Harris left this City, <persRef ref="meyer-jc">Meyer</persRef>
							had treated Harris more like a Mooshik than a Gentleman. That he had on
							settling the accounts of their partnership thrown upon Harris all the
							debts in America— That Harris was much dissatisfied but took the
							accounts just as they were presented. That Meyer had cast off Harris
							with undissembled contempt, though he had made two millions of Rubles by
							the connection with him;—but that the last week before Harris went away,
							Meyer courted him again, and made him very handsome offers. Norman
							hinted that he thought it probable Meyer had succeeded in renewing the
							connection with Harris— He complained of Meyer’s conduct towards
							himself, and said Meyer was his Enemy— He also told me of his own
							ineffectual attempts to bring about a connection in business between
								<persRef ref="lewis-john">Lewis</persRef> and Harris, the failure of
							which I suppose is the principal cause of Lewis’s inveteracy now against
							Harris. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman brought me the Power which
							Harris left with him, as his Agent to transact the business of the
							Consulate, and asked me if I thought he could endorse it— As it
							contained no Power of Substitution, I thought he could not— He therefore
							left the Power with me— He waits for the arrival of the English Mails,
							of which there are now twenty-one due, and asked me to obtain a
							Courier’s Passport for him when he should be ready to go—which I
							promised him I would.— I read the third Book of <persRef
								ref="sully-maximilien">Sully’s</persRef> Memoirs, which attach my
							attention more and more— It is probably the most interesting Book of the
							work, by the variety and importance of the Events related in
							it—containing the Deaths of the <persRef ref="louisconde">Prince of
								Condé</persRef> and of <persRef ref="catherinedemedici">Catherine of
								Medicis</persRef>— The assassinations of the <persRef
								ref="henryofguise">Duke</persRef> and <persRef ref="louisofguise"
								>Cardinal de Guise</persRef> by <persRef ref="henry-iii">Henry the
									3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi></persRef>— That of Henry the
							third himself by <persRef ref="clement-jacques">Jaques
							Clément</persRef>—the final alliance of Henry 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d:</hi> and <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry 4<hi rend="superscript"
									>th:</hi></persRef> against the Ligue, and the Battles of Arques
							and of Ivry; the whole interspersed with many excellent moral and
							political reflections. The particulars respecting Sully himself are also
							curious and important— The death of his wife— His house shut up against
							him, while she was dying, by his own brother; the dangers he escaped
							from, and the wounds he received at the Battle of Ivry; his four
							Prisoners who surrendered themselves to him alone, and in the most
							forlorn condition, his quarrel with d’Andelot a Son of <persRef
								ref="coligny-francois">Coligny’s</persRef> for the Standard of the
							House of Guise, and the singular triumphal procession devised by his
							Ecuyer Maignan, are all incidents so striking that I am surprized at
							having no recollection of them from my former perusal of the book— After
							dinner I walked to the Summer-Garden Bridge— Met <persRef
								ref="destutt-victor">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Tracy</persRef> who walked with me—still feeding himself with
							flattering delusions though far reduced from the Confidence of his
							hopes, when here last week— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis spent
							part of the Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

						<p><date>29. VI. </date>But I was obliged again to suspend my Chronology.
								<persRef ref="colombi-maria">Countess Colombi</persRef> and her
								<persRef ref="bode-clementine">Sister Clémentine</persRef> paid
							visits to our <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef>. I went to <persRef ref="u">Grabit’s</persRef>, to
							compare my minute of purchases at the sale with his Account, and found
							the Auction was not finished— His book agreed exactly with my minute,
							and I asked him to give a credit to <persRef ref="desenovert-etienne"
								>General Senovert</persRef>, and charge me for one Book which he had
							purchased and agreed to let me take— After a walk I returned home, and
							read the fourth Book of <persRef ref="sully-maximilien">Sully’s</persRef>
							Memoirs— It introduces a new Military Personage, and a great General,
								<persRef ref="farnese-alessandro">Alexander Farnese</persRef>,
							Prince of Parma, opposed to <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry 4</persRef>—
							This Book like the rest is full of instruction for a General and a
							Statesman; but the best Book in the world is like the Pipe that <persRef
								ref="hamlet">Hamlet</persRef> offers to <persRef ref="rosenkrantz"
								>Rosenkrantz</persRef> and <persRef ref="guildenstern"
								>Gildenstern</persRef>— It will discourse excellent Music only to
							those who know how to govern the ventages. Sully tells his Story with
							candour, occasionally acknowledges his own faults and even though more
							gently those of his Master— One of Henry’s faults was the rashness with
							which he exposed his person in Action— A signal example of it is given
							in this Book, <pb n="81" type="ms"/>at the affair which Henry used
							afterwards himself to call the <hi rend="italic">error</hi> of Aumale.
							But I believe it impossible to acquire the reputation of Courage so
							indispensable to a military Commander, without committing many such
							errors. On that occasion Henry must have perished or at least been taken
							Prisoner, which to him and his cause would have been the same thing, but
							for an error of the opposite kind, excess of Prudence in the Prince of
							Parma, who thinking it impossible that Henry should expose himself as he
							was actually doing, suspected an Ambuscade, and lost the opportunity of
							taking or destroying his Enemy without danger, and without possibility
							of failure. Yet the Prince of Parma was personally brave, and Henry’s
							courage was tempered with sound Judgment and Discretion— He had
							Vigilance, Activity, and the natural faculty, improved by the Study of
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="scipio-metellus">Scipio’s</persRef> lives, of seizing the
							critical moment, and moving with rapidity— <persRef ref="sixtus-v"
								>Sixtus V</persRef> said that he could not fail of conquering
							Mayenne, because the <hi rend="italic">Béarnois</hi> spent less time in
							bed than the other did at table.— It was said of him too, that he wore
							out more Boots than shoes— Qualities, all suited to form a great
							character— His temper too seems to have been expressly adapted to his
							situation. It would seem as if Sully was the only man, who had ever any
							real attachment to his person— Between the Catholics and the
							Protestants, filled with all the Furies against one another, he was
							obliged to share his favours, and his armies and his Councils were
							composed of Elements more at War with themselves than with his
							adversaries.— His Catholic troops were ever ready to join his Enemies on
							account of his Religion; and the Protestants, for want of pay; while his
							financier a treacherous Catholic purposely kept his coffers drained, to
							produce the mutinies which might hasten his ruin. Then the private ends,
							the selfish projects, the jealousies and rivalries of his principal
							officers and adherents, the unsteadiness of some, the imbecility of
							others, and the profligacy of almost all were such perpetual obstacles
							to his success that one can scarcely believe it possible that he should
							have surmounted them. He told Sully after the Battle of Ivry, that
							untill then he had never been in a conditon to form <hi rend="italic"
								>Designs</hi>—that he had only felt <hi rend="italic">Desires</hi>.
							His greatest, or rather his only vice was his Passion for Women; which
							was so excessive that in my Mind it casts a foul and indelible stain
							upon his character. It is indeed one of those Vices for which Mankind
							always had and ever will have great Indulgence. But to Men in such
							Stations, and placed under such Circumstances as his it is one of the
							most pernicious and fatal of Vices. Whether it is so Constitutional in
							some men and was in him, as to be uncontroulable I cannot undertake to
							say— But I can never consider the disgrace of a Goat, as the honour of a
							Man. On the other hand his Good-humour, his attachment to his friends,
							his humanity, his sacred regard to his word, are such admirable virtues,
							that it gives us a poor opinion of human nature to see how little they
							availed to gain him the affection even of his own partizans.— I rode out
							after dinner, and walked on the Quay’s with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Adams</persRef>— Then worked a couple of hours in my chamber, at my
							Collection of State-Papers, and at ten closed the Evening.</p>

							a smile.— That begins with two or three Spenserian Stanza’s, and then
							breaks off into the dull, monotonous couplet. It would have been much
							better to have persevered with the Stanza, throughout, and the Poem is
							so short that it could not have been very difficult.— But Crabbe’s
							poetical Powers, are not of a very high order; and like <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Walter Scott</persRef> he appears unable to step

						<p><date>31. V.45. </date>Received the Books I had purchased at the Auction;
							and among them I found three Volumes of the Miscellaneous Works of a
								<persRef ref="daignan-anne">Marquis d’Orbessan</persRef>— I had
							never heard of this writer before, and his name is not to be found
							either in the Dictionnaire Historique, not in the Dictionnaire de
							Bibliographie— His fame has therefore not circulated very widely— In
							turning over the Pages of his Book, I found a Translation into French
							Prose, of <persRef ref="moore-edward">Moore’s</persRef> Fable of the
							Sparrow and the Dove, and a formal parallel, between it and <persRef
								ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine’s</persRef> two Pigeons. The
							comparison had occurred to me (v. Journal 29. April 1812.) but the
							Marquis prefers the French Fable, and I the English one. He perceives
							none of the faults in La Fontaine which struck me, and thinks that
							Moore’s Sparrow is not sufficiently punished, and that his Dove is too
							much of a scholar— There may be something in this last objection, but I
							think it a very slight error in comparison with La Fontaine’s
							Brother-Lovers, and his cowardly caution against travelling to see the
							world— <pb n="82" type="ms"/>I read the 5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							Book of <persRef ref="sully-maximilien">Sully’s</persRef> Memoirs which is
							at least equally interesting with any of the preceding Books— It shews
							Sully as a great Statesman and Negotiator, as well as a military
							character— Many of the incidents have an air of Romance about them which
							raise an involuntary suspicion that there is a little colouring added to
							the narrative— Yet they are told with such particulars of detail, as
							have all the appearance of truth— Such is the account of his Mine, by
							which the Castle of Dreux was taken; and that of his obtaining all the
							Papers of Secret Negotiation between the <persRef
								ref="charlesdelorraine">Duke de Mayenne</persRef> and Spain, and
							those of the third Party, whose project was to raise the <persRef
								ref="debourbon-charles">Cardinal de Bourbon</persRef> to the throne,
							and to get rid of <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry 4</persRef> by
							assassination— The characters of the <persRef ref="debourbon-charles2"
								>Count de Soissons</persRef> and of the <persRef
								ref="lavalette-jean">Duke d’Epernon</persRef> are well drawn— Those
							of <persRef ref="jeannin-pierre">Jeannin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="denuefville-nicolas">Villeroy</persRef>, the <persRef ref="u"
								>Abbé de Bellozane</persRef>, and <persRef ref="duperron-jacques"
								>Cardinal Duperron</persRef> sketched with a masterly hand. Sully
							ascribes entirely to his own Advice the king’s change of Religion, the
							Resolution for which was first adopted upon mere motives of policy— This
							is a very delicate point in the estimate of Henry’s character, and it is
							treated by Sully with great delicacy and circumspection— He says he
							believes that Henry’s conversion was in the last result sincere— That he
							finally came to the conclusion that the Catholic Faith was the safest—
							But in the controversial discussions between the divines of the two
							Sects, which he attended to fix his Creed, it was a tacit understanding
							on both sides that the Catholic Doctors should have the best of the
							Argument, and the Protestants had complaisantly consented to be
							defeated— Such State-jugglery in a matter of Religion is not very
							creditable to any of the parties, and very disgraceful to the Protestant
							Champions. It seems to me that both the Wisdom and the Virtue of Henry’s
							Apostasy are very equivocal. Had he firmly adhered to his first Faith,
							the Protestant Religion would have prevailed in France, and the
							Intolerance, the Persecutions; the Monkish Bigotry, and the perfidious
							Tyranny of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. would never have
							desolated that Country.— Yet it is hard to say that the measure was not
							indispensably necessary; when it was so considered by so sound a head
							and so firm a Heart as Sully; an inflexible Protestant himself; yet the
							first to advise his Master to that change, in which he could never be
							prevailed upon to follow the example.— One of the remarkable features of
							those times is the secrecy with which Henry was obliged to cover his
							Confidence in Sully, who for many years was his most intimate friend and
							Counsellor, without holding under him any office of apparent importance,
							and without being able to obtain the Government even of the Places,
							taken by himself— They were obliged to appear in public upon the coldest
							and most distant terms of reserve, and Sully was habitually introduced
							to the king’s Apartment in the Night, for the most important
							Consultations, to elude the Jealousy and Envy of the Catholic Nobles.— I
							walked before and after dinner, and wrote to the Secretary of State—
							Evening, engaged with the State-Papers.</p>
