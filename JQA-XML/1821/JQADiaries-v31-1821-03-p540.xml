						<p><date>1. V:30.</date> Thursday. <persRef ref="moore-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Moore</persRef> a member of the
							House of Representatives from Pennsylvania; and <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M.
								Johnson</persRef> Senator from Kentucky called at my house. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore’s object was to request me to send
							to <persRef ref="patterson-robert2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef>, the Director of the Mint at Philadelphia, a
							copy of the Report upon Weights and Measures, when it is printed— I
							promised him that I would; and told him that having been applied to from
							various persons for one or more copies of it, and wishing to send copies
							of it to some learned Societies and to several individuals in Europe as
							well as in this Country, it would be an accommodation to me, if the
							House in ordering the Report to be printed would direct one hundred
							copies to be placed at the disposal of the Department of State— The
							Senate had in fact passed such an order: but I was apprehensive the
							number given by them would scarcely be sufficient. Moore said he would
							obtain an order of the House to the same effect— I had last week at the
							President’s drawing Room, asked <persRef ref="simkins-elred">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Simkins</persRef> a member of the
							House from South-Carolina, to move this in the House, when the Report
							should be sent in, the next Morning. Simkins had consented to make the
							motion, but with an intimation that there might in the temper of the
							House be some question made about it— I therefore wrote him a line when
							I sent in the Report, requesting him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to make
							the motion— The Report when received by the House was merely ordered to
							lie on the table. In the Senate an Order passed that 600 copies should
							be printed 500 of which for the use of the Senate and 100. for the use
							of the Department of State— Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Johnson’s
							call was upon a claim set up by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> for 4500 dollars, or
							half an outfit as Minister Plenipotentiary for the Negotiation of the
							commercial convention with England of 3. July 1815— Clay’s Accounts for
							his Mission to Europe were settled in 1816. five years ago— For an
							absence of about eighteen Months he received upwards of twenty-six
							thousand dollars— His passage out was in a public ship, and at the
							public expence. He was alone in Europe, without any part of his family,
							and lived at less expence than any other American Minister who ever was
							in Europe. It is impossible that his expenses in the eighteen Months
							should have exceeded 10000 dollars, and now five years after account has
							been settled at the Treasury he comes and claims this new allowance of
							Half an outfit. He made the demand directly to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> by Letter. Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson was exceedingly anxious that it
							should immediately be complied with. I told him that it could not be
							done without an act of Congress; and he urged that the President should
							send a Message to Congress <pb type="ms" n="541"/>recommending such an
							Act, which he said would pass both houses without a dissenting voice— It
							is of very great importance to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson
							to be well with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay; and they help each
							other to draw from the Treasury, as long as it will bleed— There was a
							Cabinet Meeting at the President’s; when he read the address which he
							had prepared to deliver at his second inauguration; next Monday. But he
							proposed for regular consideration whether he should deliver any address
							at-all. <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy expressed again his
							doubts of the propriety of making any such speeches, which he observed
							were not required by the Constitution, and for which he said he did not
							see any adequate reason— The uniformity of the practice on former
							occasions might he said be a motive for continuing it; but if it were a
							new question he should be opposed to it.— My opinion was otherwise—
							Independent of the uniform usage, I thought there was a propriety in the
							thing itself. The inauguration, was the only occasion presented by our
							Institutions for direct intercourse between the Chief Magistrate and the
							Nation. It was very proper, at his first election, to avail himself of
							it, to declare succinctly the principles upon which he proposes to
							conduct his administration; and when reelected, there is equal propriety
							in reviewing before the world the progress of past events as connected
							with the principles which have been pursued, and in announcing the
							perseverance with which they will be continued. There was nothing in the
							Constitution which required that the President should address Congress
							at the Commencement of every Session. But there was a manifest propriety
							that he should, and the practice was accordingly so. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson did not press the discussion, and
							the other members of the Administration agreed that there was no
							adequate reason for discontinuing the practice hitherto uniformly
							observed— The Address itself was then discussed— It announces a
							persevering attachment to the course of policy of preparing by extensive
							and systematic fortifications for the defence of the Country— It
							intimates the determination if the deficiencies of the revenue should
							continue to recommend the re-establishment of a system of internal
							taxation, and it expressed in general terms a disapprobation of the
							expedient of resorting to loans— There were expressions favourable to
							the manufacturing interests to which <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> made some
							objections, and which were slightly modified. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> as usual objected to nothing, but upon some
							observation that I made, anticipating the revival at the next Session of
							Congress of <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin’s</persRef> tariff bills, Crawfords aversion to them, and
							his delight at their failure, discovered themselves by an involuntary
							burst of exultation— I requested the President to reconsider, the
							stigmatick mark of censure which he had inserted upon <hi rend="italic"
								>loans</hi>— I thought it unseasonable at the very moment when we
							were under the necessity of resorting to a considerable loan; impolitic;
							as it would furnish a weapon against himself; if as was very likely he
							should want further loans hereafter; and incorrect in principle, as
							giving countenance to a popular prejudice against loans, which I thought
							altogether unjust. Loans should never be made to meet or cover
							extravagant expenses, and it ought to be the earnest object of
							Government to raise within the year the means of providing for the
							expenditure of the year— So should an individual— But there were
							numberless occasions upon which the most judicious and frugal economist
							might find it useful to borrow money, and a superstitious antipathy to
							it as a mode of raising money, was neither wise policy nor sound
							morality. The president said he concurred in this opinion; and he
							altered the passage in the address; omitting the general declaration
							against loans— I spent the Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thorntons</persRef>— There is a
							small comet, within these few days visible in the Square of Pegasus.</p>

								<persRef ref="smith-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> Senator from South-Carolina came and introduced to
							me a <persRef ref="hunt-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hunt</persRef> of that State. I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> upon various <pb type="ms"
								n="542"/>subjects— The appropriations for the Ghent Treaty
							Commissions; the numberless applications for Offices in Florida, and for
							the Commission of Claims under the new Treaty— The Claim of <persRef
								ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade</persRef>, the Interrogatories for
							the trial of <persRef ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef> vs
								<persRef ref="lewis-william">W. D. Lewis</persRef>—the Negociation
							with the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef>,
							and the nominations to several Offices, upon which the Senate must pass
							this day or to-morrow. This multiplicity of business tends to
							distraction— <persRef ref="gracie-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Archibald Gracie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								King</persRef> of New-York came to the Office to request a new
							interposition of the Government, specially urging that of France to
							indemnify M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gracie, for the arbitrary
							seizure of a Cargo of Colonial produce, at Antwerp in 1808 by the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>. There
							were six other claims in the same condition— The property was seized and
							sold and its proceeds confiscated without a form of process— It was a
							bare act of public robbery. But every application to the justice, and
							even to the sense of decency of the French Government, to obtain
							indemnity for it has proved abortive— Two Years ago M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gracie went himself to France, in the
							pursuit of his claim, and then at his own instance and that of his
							relative <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
								King</persRef> of the Senate obtained an Instruction from the
							Department of State to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, particularly to
							press this claim, upon the Consideration of the French Government—though
							without disparagement to any other claim— Gallatin accordingly presented
							a Note and received an unsatisfactory Answer— He was also dissatisfied
							with this mode of proceeding, as being less likely to succeed than a
							general application in behalf of all the claims— But the French
							Government have lately compromised one claim for property taken during
							Napoleon’s Government, in the Isle of France, upon which there had been
							a decree of Restitution— Gracie and Charles King now came to solicit a
							special recommendation of this claim, to the French Government through
							the French Minister de Neuville— I told them I would speak of it to him,
							but it could not be otherwise than in general terms and connected with a
							recommendation of all the other claims of Citizens of the United States
							upon France— We had company to dine with us. <persRef

						<p><date>3. VI:</date> Close of the sixteenth Congress; and of the first
							term of the Administration of <persRef key="monroe-james">James
								Monroe</persRef>. This morning <persRef ref="cook-daniel">Daniel P.
								Cook</persRef> of Illinois called at my house; to recommend friends
							for appointments and to converse upon politics— He says that the
								<persRef ref="bond-shadrach">Governor of the State</persRef> refuses
							to give him a certificate of his election to the next Congress, though
							he was chosen by a majority of near three thousand votes. There was some
							defect or irregularity in the Law of the State under which the election
							was held; but before the election both the candidates pledged
							themselves, not to take exception to it, however the result might turn
							out. The Governor however not being a party to this agreement, and being
							opposed to Cook, who may thereby be disabled from taking his seat, and
							subjected to the chances of another election— I was at the President’s;
							and found him occupied about this Postliminary claim of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> for a
							supplementary half outfit of 4500 dollars; M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay himself, and his friend <persRef ref="johnson-richard"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef>
							for him, both pressing for the allowance in a very urgent manner. It is
							contrary to every precedent and every principle; but the President to
							whom Clay applied for it directly by Letter to himself, feels an
							awkwardness at deciding it against him, precisely because Clay, has
							pursued a course of insidious hostility against his Administration. He
							has however concluded to postpone <pb type="ms" n="543"/>the
							determination of it for the present. The President requested me to
							attend at the Capitol, between four and five O’Clock this afternoon—
							Between one and two I received a Resolution from the Senate passing a
							Negative upon the nomination of <persRef ref="appleton-john">John James
								Appleton</persRef> as Chargé D’Affaires at Rio de Janeiro— At this I
							was much surprized and disappointed; apprehending that it was because
							some of the Letters most warmly recommending him had not been sent with
							the nomination. I had a search made for them at the Office, and they
							were sent to the Senate. I dined at four O’Clock, and immediately
							afterwards went to the Capitol, where I found the President had already
							arrived. I met <persRef ref="eustis-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Eustis</persRef> at the door of the South Wing, and
							spoke to him about Appleton. He said he had been earnest in recommending
							him, but he understood that one or more of the Senators had taken a
							fancy to go to Rio de Janeiro themselves, and were not averse to going
							in the capacity of Minister Plenipotentiary— But no objection had been
							made to Appleton but his Youth— Notwithstanding this hint I spoke in
							Appleton’s favour to <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Barbour</persRef> the Chairman
							of the Committee of Foreign Relations of the Senate, whom I intreated to
							lay before the Senate the additional recommendations which had at first
							not been sent. He said he would, but told me that unless they could add
							to the years, and experience of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton
							they would be of no avail: the opinion of the Senate being unanimous
							that a person of the first talents, and highest standing of character
							ought to be sent immediately as Minister Plenipotentiary to Rio de
							Janeiro— A resolution of the Senate of that purport was in the course of
							the Evening brought in to the President, by <persRef ref="cutts-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Cutts</persRef> their
							Secretary— The wisest bodies are not always perfectly consistent— In the
							Estimates for the present year, I had inserted an outfit and Salary for
							a Minister Plenipotentiary at Rio de Janeiro. While those estimates were
							before the Committee of Ways and Means of the House, their Chairman,
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> S.
								Smith</persRef>, wrote me a Letter, enquiring among other things
							whether the appointment of a Minister to Brazil could not for the
							present year be dispensed with. The President, not without some
							hesitation authorised me to answer that it might; but that it would then
							be necessary to appropriate an outfit, and Salary for a Chargé
							d’Affaires. This was accordingly done, in the general Appropriation
							Bill— The outfit and Salary for a Minister were struck out, and those
							for a Chargé d’Affaires were inserted— This General Appropriation Bill
							the Senate passed this day, with the Appropriations for a Chargé
							d’Affaires, and without those for a Minister—and on the same day they
							unanimously pass a Resolution recommending the immediate appointment of
							a Minister— I observed to the President, that the Law spoke one language
							and the Resolution another, directly the reverse, both emanating from
							the same body, on the same day; and as the law received his sanction it
							expressed the Sentiment both of the whole Legislature and of the
							Executive, while the Resolution expressed the sense of only one branch
							of the Legislature, and that in direct opposition to their own opinion
							likewise expressed in the Law. It would look very odd, if after signing
							the appropriation act this day with an outfit and Salary for a Charge
							d’Affaires, he should next week appoint a Minister, without any previous
							appropriation; and in these economical times would not escape the
							animadversion of the House of Representatives at the next Session— The
							President said he should be in no hurry to act upon the Resolution of
							the Senate, but would take ample time for consideration— There were
							thirty-Bills and two Resolutions this day presented to the President for
							his signature—and upon two of them the Military Appropriation, and the
							loan Bill, there was disagreements between the two Houses which were
							settled only by conferences— While the President remained in the
							Committee Room, I passed a part of the Evening in the House of
							Representatives.—There was little debate, and less confusion than usual—
							Though it was difficult to keep together a Quorum— I conversed with
							several of the members, on various subjects.— <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallary</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee on the Ghent
							Commissions, came and told me that they had made the appropriation for
							the year, which I had recommended in my last Letter to him— I said <pb
								type="ms" n="544"/>they had however reduced the Salaries, not only
							of the Agents, as they had the right to do, but of the Commissioners
							which I thought a very harsh measure as regarded individuals, and
							contrary to the understanding and intent if not to the Letter of the
							agreement under the Treaty. That if either of the Commissioners should
							resign upon the passage of this Act, as they would have the right to do,
							and as I think I should do, in their place, it would throw the whole
							business into a very awkward predicament and much increase, instead of
							diminishing the expence. He said he did not think they would resign. And
							then observed that he was glad the Florida Treaty had terminated in a
							manner so entirely satisfactory— <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef> the Chairman of the
							Committee upon the expenditures of the Department of State told me that
							he had made this morning, a Report to the House approving altogether the
							appointment of <persRef ref="delafield-joseph">Major
							Delafield</persRef>, after the close of the last Session of Congress,
							and declaring generally the correctness of the Accounts of the
							Department of State, so far as the Committee had examined them. He spoke
							as if he was ashamed of his motion which was intended as an attack upon
							me; and ashamed also to make public the justification which he had not
							been able to withhold— This is the last day of Storrs’s present
							political existence. He has no prospect of being elected to the next
							Congress. He has considerable talents, and some taste for literature;
							with which I have always a strong sympathy. But he wants both judgment
							and firmness. The Missouri question has blasted him, and the loss of his
							popularity at home, with the loss of all his influence in the House,
							have driven him to vicious habits, and made his career as a Statesman
							abortive— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay moved a vote of thanks to
							the Speaker, <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef>,
							prefaced by a short, studied, but grossly indelicate speech— As however
							it was quite conciliatory, as to the sentiment, it passed without
							animadversion— The <persRef ref="dougherty-thomas">Clerk of the
								House</persRef>, put the question, and there was only one voice
							answered in the negative— That was <persRef ref="reid-robert">R. R.
								Reid</persRef> of Georgia. About an hour afterwards the Speaker
							shortly addressed the house in answer to the vote of thanks. His speech
							was both in matter and delivery much better than Clay’s— It was past
							twelve O’Clock at Night before the business of the two Houses was
							finished; and a half an hour later before the last Bills were examined
							and signed by the President, and notified to the two Houses as thus
							completed. A joint Committee, consisting of <persRef ref="holmes-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef> of Maine and
								<persRef ref="hunter-william">Hunter</persRef> of the Senate, and
								Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> S. Smith and <persRef
								ref="cushman-joshua">Joshua Cushman</persRef> of the House of
							Representatives came, and informed the President that they were ready to
							adjourn, unless he had any further communication to make to them; to
							which he answered that he had none. It was near one in the Morning when
							they adjourned— And thus finished the sixteenth Congress of the United
							States— I walked home, in company as far as his house, with <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>—
							I found him in some degree dispirited by the results of the attack
							systematically carried on through this whole Congress but especially
							through the Session just expired against his management of the War
							Department. He thinks that the present embarrassments in the
							Administration, all originated in two measures of the first Session of
							Congress under it. The repeal of the internal taxes, and the profuse
							pension Act— The present falling off in the revenue he says ought to
							have been foreseen; and also that on the failure of revenue, the War
							Department would naturally be the first upon which the scythe of
							retrenchment would fall. He observed also the Coalition of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford’s</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Clinton’s</persRef> and Clay’s partizans,
							though with views quite hostile to each other, in the assaults of this
							Session, against the administration. The vote of thanks proposed by Clay
							to the Speaker, Taylor; the appointment by Taylor, of the most violent
							opponents to the Administration upon Committees. The combinations of the
							Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky New-York and Vermont members, devoted to
							their respective leaders, and joining all their forces against the
							Administration— All this is unquestionably true— There have also been
							transactions in the War Department, in the Post-Office, and in the Bank
							of the United States, which have unfortunately given handle to every
							class of disaffection— <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef>
							Seminole Campaign, the Florida Treaty, and the South American insurgents
							have all been used in turn as weapons of annoyance— By the practical
							operation of our Government, the whole system of our Politics is
							inseparably linked with the views of aspirants to the Presidential
							succession; and by the peculiarity of our present position, the
							prospects of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Candidates in reserve for
							the next Presidency, excepting the Vice-President, and setting aside the
								<pb type="ms" n="545"/>Secretary of State depend upon the <hi
								rend="italic">failure</hi> of the present Administration for their
							success. The worst of it is, that this applies more forcibly to
							Crawford, a leading Member of the Administration himself than to any
							other— Crawford has been a worm preying upon the vitals of the
							Administration within its own body— He was the instigator, and animating
							Spirit of the whole movement, both in Congress and at Richmond against
							Jackson and the Administration— In all the vicissitudes of the Spanish
							Negotiation, wherever there has been difficulty or prospect of failure,
							he has been felt, when he could not be seen, and all the attacks against
							the War Department, during this Congress have been stimulated by him and
							promoted by his partizans— An essential impulse to this course on his
							part is the knowledge he has obtained that Calhoun, is not prepared to

							the Treasury, and Crawford’s utter inability to devise <hi rend="italic"
								>any</hi> other source of Revenue but loan upon loan, very naturally
							lead him to favour any kind of retrenchment, and especially such as will
							not bear upon any of his friends— It has been the policy of all the
							parties, to keep hostilities in reserve against me this Session; and to
							assail the War Department as an out work. At this Moment standing on the
							Isthmus between the past and the future, I look back with satisfaction
							solid and pure at what has been accomplished of public service, with
							humility and regret that more has not been effected, and with unbounded
							Gratitude to the disposer of all results— Forward, the prospect is beset
							with difficulties and dangers— Let me advance cheerily to meet the
							dispensations of Time; pursuing with singleness of Soul the path of
							duty; imploring for the faculty to will and to do—“to move in Charity,
							to rest in Providence, and to turn on the Poles of Truth.”</p>

							attired in a full suit of black broad cloth, of somewhat antiquated

							But on alighting at the Capitol, a great crowd of people were <pb

							House were so choaked up with persons pressing for admittance, that it
							was with the utmost difficulty that the President made his way through

							this Crowd unable to obtain admission— We got in at last after several
							minutes of severe pressure. There was not a soldier present, nor a
							constable distinguishable by any badge of Office— The President took a
							seat on a Platform just before the Speaker’s Chair— The <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice</persRef> was seated at his right
							hand, the other judges of the Supreme Court, in Chairs fronting him; the
								<persRef ref="gaillard-john">President of the Senate</persRef> and
							late Speaker of the House at his left hand. The Heads of Department
							side-long at the right and the Foreign Ministers in the Seats of the
							Members at the left— The House and Galleries were as thronged as
							possible— There was much disorder of loud talking, and agitation in the
							Gallery; not altogether ceasing even while the President was reading his
							Address; which he did immediately after taking the Oath— At this
							Ceremony the Chief-Justice merely held the book, the President repeating
							the Oath in the words prescribed by the Constitution. The Address was
							delivered in a suitably grave, and rather low tone of voice— After it
							was finished several persons came up to the President and shook hands
							with him by way of congratulation— At his departure from the House,
							there was a cheering shout from the people in the Galleries—and the
							Music of the Marine Band played both at his entrance and departure— I
							returned home with my family; and immediately afterwards went to the

									>r</hi> Sanford</persRef> late Senator from New-York, called at
							my house this morning to take leave. I have entertained a very
							favourable opinion of his talents and principles, from his public
							conduct in the Senate these four years, and his private deportment has
							been invariably kind and friendly to me— About three years since he
							intimated to me that the appointment of Minister to France would be
							acceptable to him, if, as was then expected a vacancy there should
							occur. I mentioned it to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> at that time, but the vacancy did not then
							occur; nor has it yet taken place— But it is still expected, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford said if it should happen, the
							appointment would yet be agreeable to him. I told him it was doubtful,
							whether <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> would return this year. And if he should return I
							could not say who would be the person appointed to France in his stead—
							All I could say was that my good wishes would be with him. We had some
							further conversation; but as he had not appeared disposed last Tuesday
							to speak of the New-York State-politics, I did not now, nor did he
							allude to them— On leaving me he appeared to be much affected— I was so
							myself— I wished him with great cordiality health and happiness; and on
							taking my hand at parting he assured me with earnestness of his
							friendship; adding that he would at a proper time give proof of it. This
							was not only spontaneous on his part, but entirely unexpected on mine— I
							made no reply; but took it as a momentary effusion of good will
							intending a reciprocation of the friendly sentiments which I had
							manifested towards him. The day was almost wholly absorbed at the
							Office, with visitors. <persRef ref="parrott-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parrott</persRef>, Senator for
							New-Hampshire came to renew a recommendation of a friend for a Consular
							appointment— <persRef ref="terrell-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Terrell</persRef> member of the late House from Georgia
							came to take leave; having declined a re-election to Congress— There
							were published in the Charleston City Gazette in January of the last
							year two long and elaborate attacks upon me, addressed to me under the
							signature of Sagittarius— Terrell told me a short time after their
							publication that he knew who was the author of them: and told it as if
							he meant to tell me— I did not ask him however, neither did he tell me.
							As it is very likely I shall not see him again, I determined now to
							ascertain whether he would tell me or not— I reminded him therefore of
							what he had said last winter, which he recollected, and asked <pb
								type="ms" n="547"/>him, as he knew the author of Sagittarius, if he
							had any objection to tell me who it was. He looked very much
							embarrassed; and answered slowly and doubtingly—no—he believed not—he
							thought he could tell me; but he did not tell me; and I soon relieved
							him from his perplexity by changing the subject of Conversation— Why he
							told me last Winter that he knew the and why he now so awkwardly evaded
							telling me who it was, I shall probably never know.— <persRef
								ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef> the
							member of the house from Missouri came to ask for a new application to
							the Spanish Government, for the liberation of <persRef
								ref="bard-unknown">Bard</persRef>, <persRef ref="mcknight-unknown2"
								>M’Knight</persRef> and some other American Citizens who have been
							several years imprisoned in Mexico. Notwithstanding the late decree of
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef> for the release
							of all Citizens of the United States detained as State prisoners in the
							Spanish dominions, Scott says these persons have not been discharged,
							and some of their relations wish for Passports to go to them— I sent to
								<persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, who furnished
							Letters to serve as Passports. <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>
							two years ago had refused them— <persRef ref="baker-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. M. Baker</persRef> came to
							supplicate for some appointment under the Florida Treaty. His Situation
							is truly distressing. A <persRef ref="sweney-unknown">M<hi

							of recommendation from <persRef ref="gregg-andrew">Andrew
								Gregg</persRef>, now Secretary to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
							and with whom I formerly sat in the Senate of the United States— Sweney
							came all the way from Pennsylvania, to ask for an Office in any of the
							Public Departments; but there is no vacancy. <persRef ref="hurd-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John R. Hurd</persRef> of
							New-York called at the Office— He has been some time here upon business
							before Congress— As he was the first person who called for an official
							investigation of <persRef ref="harris-levett">L. Harris’s</persRef>
							conduct as Consul in Russia, I enquired of him whether he had known any
							thing of it other than what he had stated to me, in his Letter of
							September 1817. He knew nothing but by hearsay. But he gave me a written
							statement of two English vessels, who bought admission as Americans, by
							the Certificates of Harris, in 1808—the names of the vessel, master, and
							sum paid, as told by <persRef ref="rodde-diedrich">Diederich
								Rodde</persRef> to <persRef ref="bates-unknown">Captain
								Bates</persRef> and by Bates to Hurd— I spoke to him also of a Straw
							Bonnet, made at Weathersfield sold some months since at New-York as an
							extraordinary specimen of American manufacture; which Hurd bought and
							sent as a present to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>— I told Hurd that while in the public situation which
							I hold, I made it a principle to accept no valuable present from any
							one. It was very harsh to interdict the acceptance of presents offered
							to my wife, and it gave me pleasure to see her giving countenance
							according to our means to the productions or ingenuity of our Country— I
							had therefore consented to her acceptance of his present, and should
							only take some opportunity to ask his acceptance of some equivalent in
							return— He said he hoped I should not think of it, and mentioned his
							reason for sending the bonnet to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams,
							which was merely because he thought, it would give it the best
							opportunity of attracting notice— I did not press the conversation
							further. I called at the President’s to consult upon measures to be
							taken, for carrying into execution the Florida Treaty.— The Appointment
							of Commissioners—Secretaries, Revenue and judicial Officers is yet in
							deliberation, and the measures for taking possession of the Florida’s
							are yet to be settled. I wrote also the monthly despatch to <persRef

							of Illinois called on me this morning, and took leave; I had some
							conversation with him upon political affairs— He is under some concern
							about the irregularity of his election to the new Congress— Cook is a
							man of fair mind and honourable principles, and makes a very handsome
							appearance in the House as a Speaker— He is yet under thirty and gives
							the promise of a useful and distinguished Statesman, but his health is
							very infirm and his Constitution so feeble that its duration is more
							than ordinarily doubtful. His political fortune at present is very
							curiously contingent upon the issue of intrigues bearing upon the
							Presidential Election; and before he was last chosen, last Summer, in
							the newspaper was waged against him in the State of Illinois, his regard
							for me was made one of the principal topics of charge to run him down—
							He manfully avowed it however, and carried <pb type="ms" n="548"/>the
							election by a large majority. By some defect in the State-Law, very
							probably devised for the occasion, there is a prospect that this
							election will be vacated; which besides putting Cook to the trouble and
							expense of travelling 2500 Miles from his residence here and back, will
							leave the State unrepresented in the House nearly the whole of the next
							Session— <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> came to the Office; and left with me <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef> Spanish pamphlet upon the Florida
							Treaty. The object of this publication was to defend himself against the
							charge of having signed a Treaty disadvantageous to Spain— He takes
							infinite pains therefore to prove it highly advantageous, but specially
							values himself upon the flaw by which he had secured to the king, as he
							reasons the right to ratify the Treaty or to reject it at his pleasure—
							The pamphlet like all the writings of Onis, is full of
							misrepresentations and falsehoods. Forsyth spoke to me also about the
							claim of <persRef ref="meade-richard">Meade</persRef>: but very
							cautiously— He said that a large part of the sum of Meade’s demand as
							liquidated by the Spanish Government was as indemnity for his
							imprisonment. <persRef ref="lee-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richard Bland Lee</persRef> came to make enquiries whether certain
							claims in which he had some interest were included in the Treaty or not—
							I told him that this question must in all cases be for the
							consideration, and decision of the Commissioners. He was not satisfied
							with this answer and renewed the question in various shapes to all of
							which I gave in substance the same answer. <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus</persRef> came to ask
							for <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> an interview with me—which I immediately granted.—
							It was the first time he had asked it in this formal manner, and the
							first interview, at the Office since the warm scenes of the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							last January. His object was to enquire if I had any further
							propositions to make to him in relation to the co-operation for the
							suppression of the Slave-trade— I had none— He had perhaps formed some
							expectations from the Report of the Committee of the House of
							Representatives to whom the documents communicated by the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> were referred, and from the
							knowledge that the members of that Committee were in favour of the
							stipulation of mutual search— The House did not act upon the Report of
							the Committee, and I told M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Canning that
							the views of the President upon the subject had not changed. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning indulged himself in invectives
							against the Slave-trade, a topic upon which I had neither inclination or
							motive to contradict him— He finally said that he could only justify
							himself to his own Government, by satisfying them that he had done every
							thing in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> power, to prevail upon that of the
							United-States to join in the concert of measures in which several other
							Nations had agreed to concur with Great-Britain— And he asked if there
							had been any omission, on his part of any exertion which might have
							contributed to its success— I told him by no means—that he had with
							great earnestness and perservance urged every argument, which could have
							operated as persuasion to us— That the answer on our part having been in
							the first instance altogether explicit, and having been given repeatedly
							both to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> and
							himself as well as the insuperable reasons upon which it was founded, it
							would henceforth be as agreeable to us, not to be further urged upon it—
							He made no further reply, but rose and took leave. <persRef
								ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef> of
							Missouri was again at the Office; and received the Passports and the
							Letters from <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>, for which

							determined to appoint <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> Governor of the whole territory—and wrote to
							inform him of it directly— The reduction of the army, by the act of

								ref="brown-jacob">Brown</persRef> as the eldest commissioned of the

								>Scott</persRef> and <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef>
							are to be the two Brigadiers— Jackson therefore from the first of June
							will be out of the military service, and this Office of Governor of
							Florida presented itself as a fortunate occasion to save the Nation from
							the disgrace of even appearing to discard without compunction a man to
							whom they are so deeply indebted— The Commissioners of claims under <pb
								type="ms" n="549"/>the eleventh Article of the Treaty are also to be
							appointed. The President mentioned all those who by themselves, or their
							friends solicited the appointment— Their respective pretensions were
							canvassed, but the President came to no determination— Among the
							candidates is <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Hay</persRef>, the husband of the <persRef ref="hay-eliza"
								>President’s eldest daughter</persRef>; recommended by a number of
							very respectable persons in Virginia. The opinion was unanimous that
							there was no individual proposed more thoroughly qualified for the
							appointment than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay, but it was
							suggested that from his domestic relation to the President there would
							arise some public animadversion— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> said that the
							President himself could alone determine how far that consideration ought
							to have weight— I said the question appeared to me to be, whether the
							President would appoint M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay, if there was
							no personal relation between them. For if that was certain I did not
							think the personal affinity ought to operate to his exclusion— I
							proposed to the President <persRef ref="forbes-james">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> James Grant Forbes</persRef>, as
							Commissioner to carry the order from the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii"
								>king of Spain</persRef> to the <persRef ref="cajigal-juan">Governor

							our usual dinners during the Session of Congress, when we have from

							and scarcely acquainted together. It was between nine and ten in the

								ref="townsend-unknown">Townsend</persRef> of Alexandria mentioning

							the Secretary of State, and the only possible way of communicating with
							Norfolk in time to stop the Sale, is by the Steam-Boat which starts
							about 9 O’Clock to-morrow Morning from Alexandria. I immediately
							understood that the Books were a small part of the entire Edition of
							three volumes of the secret Journals of the old Congress printed at
							Boston by <persRef ref="waite-thomas">Wait</persRef> and there shipped
							by him for this place. As his contract was to deliver them at a fixed

							but I felt great anxiety for the publisher whose loss will be heavy
							unless he is insured. I felt obliged to do everything in my power to
							alleviate the loss on whomsoever it may fall, and my first concern was
							to take measures to stop the Sale. As this however was obviously to take
							place under some Statute of Virginia, to which I had not the means of
							immediate recurrence, I sent to <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey’s</persRef> lodgings requesting
							him to come to me. He was not at home. Half an hour afterwards, I sent
							for him a second time, and he came— In the mean while I was writing a
							Letter to the <persRef ref="mallorey-charles">Collector at
								Norfolk</persRef>, requesting him to put in a claim to the property
							for the Department of State, and object to the Sale. On consulting with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey, he offered to go immediately
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt the Attorney General, who has
							been long a practitioner in Virginia, and enquire of him the state of

							himself to Norfolk if necessary. He found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt yet up, and was informed by him that the sale might be stopped by a
							suitable and seasonable application— I wrote an Instruction to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey to go to Norfolk if necessary, and
							to take the proper <pb type="ms" n="550"/>measures for stopping the Sale
							in concert with the collector of the Port. But if on arriving at
							Alexandria, he should find any person going in the Steam-Boat, to whom
							he could with entire reliance trust the Letter to the Collector; he will
							send the Letter by such person, and return himself here. It was between
							one and two O’Clock when he left me, and I retired to bed.</p>

									>r</hi> Bailey</persRef> went this Morning to Alexandria where
							he found <persRef ref="foster-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Foster jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> of
							Boston, going in the Steam-Boat to Norfolk— He gave him the Letter to
								<persRef ref="mallorey-charles">the Collector</persRef> on the
							Assurance that he would deliver it in person. I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and met there <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson.</persRef> The President is still deliberating upon the
							selection of Commissioners upon the Claims under the Florida Treaty.
							Among the persons recommended is <persRef ref="munro-peter">Peter Jay
								Munro</persRef> of New-York, who was a friend and Correspondent of
							mine, from 1783 to 1785. since which latter period I have never seen him
							more than once or twice— We started in life together; being within a few
							Months of the same age. He was in Europe with his uncle <persRef
								ref="jay-john">John Jay</persRef>, during our revolutionary war, and
							it was at the negotiation of the Peace at Paris, in 1783, when I was
							there with <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, that I became
							acquainted with him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Munro has been a
							practising lawyer in the City of New-York, with a very good, but not a
							brilliant reputation. The <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice President
								Tompkins</persRef> was one of his pupils, and two or three years
							since earnestly recommended him, for the Office of U.S. District Judge
							in New-York— He has now written a Letter to the President, and two to
							me, one public and one private, very urgent for his appointment as one
							of these Commissioners. I read the Letters to me, to the President, but
							the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>,
							immediately objected to the appointment. He said he knew the
							Vice-President had a great partiality for Munro, but he was an unsteady
							man, who in Politicks had been all round the compass— I told the
							President all the motives that I had for favouring M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Munro. The friendship of early life— His
							relation to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Jay, one of the most
							distinguished founders of our national Independence, and the energy of
							the Vice President’s recommendation— The President still proposes to
							deliberate on this selection— I wrote to the Spanish Minister <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>; informing him of the
							appointment of <persRef ref="forbes-james">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> J. G. Forbes</persRef>, as Commissioner to receive the
							Florida Archives, and the order of delivery from the <persRef
								ref="cajigal-juan">Governor of Cuba</persRef>, and requesting him to
							send me the Royal Order to the Governor, and a Letter from himself to
							introduce Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Forbes to the Governor.
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> called at the Office— He is pressing upon the
							President, his claim for a half outfit for the Negotiation of the
							commercial Convention of 3. July 1815 with Great-Britain. I told him I
							thought it could not be allowed, without a special appropriation for it
							by Congress, to which he said he did not know that he should have any
							objection. But he wants the money now. Clay is one of the Commissioners
							for taking my Answers to interrogatories in the case of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">Levett Harris</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="lewis-william">W. D. Lewis</persRef>— I agreed if I could have
							them ready in time to call at the Capitol, where he is in attendance on
							the Supreme Court, and be sworn to them, Monday or Tuesday. I had some
							conversation with him on political topics, and on his own present
							retirement from public life. I asked him if it would be consistent with
							his views, in case there should within two or three years be a vacancy
							in any of the Missions abroad, to accept an appointment to it— He said
							he was obliged to me for the question, but it would not— The state of
							his private affairs, and his duty to his family had dictated to him the
							determination of a temporary retirement from the public Service. But by
							a liberal arrangement with him, the Bank of the United States had
							engaged him as their standing Counsel in the States of Kentucky and
							Ohio. He expected that in the course of three or four years this would
							relieve him from all the engagements in which he had been involved and
							enable him to return to the Public Service— In that case he should
							prefer over all others the Station from which he had just retired, a
							Seat in the House of Representatives, because that would be the place
							where he could hope to render the most useful service, to the Country.
							But he said he considered the situation of our Public Affairs now, as
							very critical and dangerous, to the Administration— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had just been re-elected with
							apparent unanimity; but he had not the slightest influence in Congress—
							His Career was considered as closed— There was nothing further to be
							expected by him or from him. Looking at Congress, they were a collection
							of <hi rend="italic">materials</hi>, and how much good, and <pb
								type="ms" n="551"/>how much evil might be done with them,
							accordingly as they should be well or ill directed. But henceforth there
							was and would not be a man in the United States possessing less <hi
								rend="italic">personal</hi> influence over them than the President—
							I saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s drift in these remarks which
							was to magnify his own importance, and to propitiate me, in favour of
							his outfit claim— His total forbearance of attack upon me, either by
							himself or his underlings in the late Session of Congress, and his
							advance through <persRef ref="brush-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Brush</persRef>, I attribute to the same cause. I told
							him the President must rely as he had done upon the public sentiment and
							upright intention to support him, and with these his Administration must
							get along as well as it could— He said he regretted that his views had
							differed from those of the Administration in relation to South-American
							Affairs— He hoped however that this difference would now be shortly
							over. But he was concerned to see indications of unfriendly dispositions
							towards the South-Americans, in our naval Officers, who were sent to the
							Pacific, and he was apprehensive they would get into some quarrel there
							which might alienate the minds of the People in the two Countries from
							each other— I said the Instructions to the naval Officers were as
							positive and pointed as words could make them, to avoid everything of
							that kind— I hoped no such event would occur, as we could have no
							possible motive for quarreling with the South-Americans— I also
							regretted the difference between his views and those of the
							Administration, upon South-American Affairs. That the final issue of
							their present struggle would be their entire Independence of Spain I had
							never doubted. That it was our true policy and our duty to take no part
							in the contest I was equally clear. The principle of neutrality to <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi> foreign Wars, was in my opinion fundamental
							to the continuance of our Liberties and of our Union— So far as they
							were contending for Independence I wished well to their cause; but I had
							seen and yet see no prospect that they would establish free or liberal
							Institutions of Government. They are not likely to promote the Spirit
							either of Freedom or of Order by their example. They have not the first
							Elements of good or of free Government. Arbitrary Power, Military and
							Ecclesiastical was stamped upon their education, upon their habits and
							upon all their Institutions. Civil dissension was infused into all their
							seminal principles; War and mutual destruction was in every member of
							their organization; moral, political and physical— I had little
							expectation of any beneficial result to this Country from any future
							connection with them, political or commercial— We should derive no
							improvement to our own Institutions by any communion with theirs— Nor
							was there any appearance of a disposition in them to take any political
							lesson from us. As to the commercial connection I agreed with him that
							little weight should be allowed to arguments of mere pecuniary interest;
							but there was no basis for much traffic between us— They want none of
							our productions, and we could afford to purchase very few of theirs.— Of
							these opinions, both his and mine, <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> must be
							the test; but I would candidly acknowledge, nothing had hitherto
							occurred to weaken in my mind the view which I had taken of this subject
							from the first— He did not pursue the discussion. Clay is an eloquent
							man with very popular manners, and great political management. He is
							like almost all the eminent men of this Country only half educated— His
							school has been the world, and in that he is a proficient. His morals,
							public and private are loose, but he has all the virtues indispensable
							to a popular man. As he is the first very distinguished man that the
							Western Country has presented as a Statesman to the Union, they are
							proportionably proud of him, and being a native of Virginia, he has all
							the benefit of that Clanish preference which Virginia has always given
							to her Sons. Clay’s temper is impetuous and his Ambition impatient— He
							has long since marked me as the principal rival in his way, and has
							taken no more pains to disguise his hostility, than was necessary for
							decorum, and to avoid shocking the public opinion— His future fortune
							and mine are in wiser hands than ours; <pb type="ms" n="552"/>I have
							never even defensively repelled his attacks. Clay has large and liberal
							views of public Affairs, and that sort of generosity which attaches
							individuals to his person. As President of the Union his Administration
							would be a perpetual succession of intrigue and management with the
							Legislature.— It would also be sectional in its Spirit, and sacrifice
							all other interests to those of the Western Country, and the
							Slave-holders. But his principles relative to internal improvements
							would produce results honourable and useful to the Nation. We spent this
							Evening at <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>10. V:30.</date> I received a Letter from the <persRef

							that he had twice taken the Official Oaths upon his re-election; once on
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March and again on the 5<hi

							during the late Session of Congress— A special messenger was sent to him
							by the President to inform him of his re-election, and he took the Oath
							at New-York— <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ninian Edwards</persRef> the Senator from Illinois
							called at my Office and took leave. I had some conversation with him,
							upon political affairs and the state of Parties—especially with regard
							to the systematic attack upon the War Department and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							which has been carried on through both Sessions of the late Congress—
								<persRef ref="cocke-john">Cocke</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cannon-newton">Cannon</persRef> of Tennessee, personal enemies
							of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, a
							personal enemy of Calhoun have been its principal leaders— With them
							have concurred, all the partizans of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>; and partly, though
							not completely, <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and his band.
							Combined, they constitute a decided majority of the House of
							Representatives— But their ulterior views are discordant. Clay operates
							for himself, and is too impatient to brook the delay incident to a full
							coalition with Crawford. He may finally settle into a Coalition either
							with Clinton or with Tompkins, and would specially prefer the latter.
							Edwards says that about the middle of the last Session, Crawford had
							lost so much ground in the public opinion, and in Congress, that his
							friends had almost given up the hope of running him as a Candidate
							at-all— But the appearance towards the close of the Session had
							encouraged them again— That he has indisputable information, that the
							Movement in Congress against Jackson’s Seminole Campaign, was instigated
							and supported by Crawford— That the whole system of Crawford’s conduct
							is War in disguise against the Administration of which he is a member—
							That he has had a long conversation with <persRef ref="hay-george"
								>George Hay</persRef>, the President’s Son in Law, upon this
							subject, on which he has very explicitly given him his opinion. That Hay
							spoke of it doubtingly— That he, Edwards, had last Evening had a long
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, whose
							disposition he found excellent, and who had no views to himself, for the
							next Presidency. <persRef ref="fisher-charles">Fisher</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, was also very well disposed— He had formed a very
							unfavourable opinion of Crawford from the course be had pursued on the
							Seminole War debate— On that question Fisher himself had been against
							Jackson; and while the debate was in progress, he had occasion to call
							with two or three other members, upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford for some other business— That Crawford then fully opened
							himself to them against Jackson and the campaign, which Fisher says,
							although concurring with his own opinion as to the merits of that case,
							disgusted him with the character and conduct of Crawford— Edwards spoke
							also of <persRef ref="barton-david">Barton</persRef>, the Senator from
							Missouri, as a man of good intentions, though exasperated by the Slave
							question, and the delay to the admission of the State into the Union—
							Two or three angry and foolish Letters from Barton, written here, during
							the late Session have been published in the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Louis Enquirer, a Missouri Newspaper, of which <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef>, the other Senator is half
							owner and was Editor— I spoke of those Letters, which glanced
							insultingly at me without naming me— He said that they were written
							under embittered and prejudiced feelings: but that notwithstanding them,
							Barton was a reasonable and well-intending man— I said that might be;
							but he had shewn me neither public justice nor private civility; nor did
							I expect anything better from him in future— Edwards further said to me
							that if I would look into the Louisville, Kentucky Public Advertiser, I
							should find it a well edited Newspaper— This is the paper, which at the
							strong solicitation of <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef>, was
							appointed to print the Laws of Congress at this last Session. What are
							Edwards’s connections with Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
							Johnson, I do not know— Johnson’s politics are too deeply involved with
							his private interests, and too dependent upon them— His popularity and
							influence in Kentucky and the Western Country have neutralized Clay’s
							hostility, and perhaps prevented the opposition which Clay at one time
							intended to have moved against the re-election of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— I am afraid that this advantage
							has been purchased by compliances with private interests and
							speculations of Johnson and his relatives in which the public interests
							have not been so rigidly guarded as they ought to have been. I am not
							without suspicion that the weight and influence of the <pb type="ms"
								n="553"/>Kentucky Johnsons is at market to the highest bidder—
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. is a man of great intrigue
							and management, and I believe warm and honest hearted—but plunged
							irrecoverably into private bank, land and money speculations, till he
							has lost the thread of his morals. Such men are not my natural friends;
							and one of the things to which whatever may be my fate, I will never
							submit, is that of applying a different scale of morality to my friends
							and to my adversaries— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> James G. Forbes
							also came and took leave— He is to sail from New-York in the Hornet
								<persRef ref="read-george">Captain Read</persRef>. His Instructions
							and the documents which he is to take with him are not yet quite ready,

								Harris</persRef> against <persRef ref="lewis-william">W. D.
								Lewis</persRef>— In this case Harris prosecutes Lewis for Slander,
							in publishing of him, what Harris at the same time knows to be true. He
							lays his damages at a hundred thousand dollars, and has fee’d all the
							most eminent lawyers in Philadelphia, to carry him through the suit. I
							very unwillingly give my deposition in this case, but am legally
							summoned, and believe it indispensable to the ends of Justice that I
							should answer fully and explicitly. Harris is one of those mixed
							characters who with some very good qualities and great address, has not
							the firmness to withstand the temptation of profitable venality. His
							situation at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg and the
							circumstances of the times gave him both temptation and opportunity such
							as perhaps was never presented to any other public officer of the United
							States, and he availed himself of it precisely to the extent which he
							thought he could do and escape detection— He made a princely fortune, by
							selling his duty and his office, at the most enormous prices. His
							premium pudoris was unconscionable. Yet he sold his signature for little
							as well as for much, and was like the lady who while exacting a thousand
							guineas from one lover, was ready to grant the same favour to another
							for a shilling— I was very slow, and dull of sight, even before
							admitting in my mind a <hi rend="italic">suspicion</hi> against Harris’s
							integrity— When I could no longer resist that, I was much more reluctant
							at yielding my belief to his prostitution; and even after being
							convinced beyond a doubt of that, I was still unwilling to expose him—
							He now avails himself of all my former partiality, indulgence and
							forbearance in his favour, to avow the intention of using it to
							discredit my testimony against him— This and his late attempt to bully
							or buy off my testimony through the intervention of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">president</persRef>, I consider as the
							desperation of a drowning man. The duty that I feel to be most incumbent
							on me is, not to suffer it to have any effect upon my testimony; and I
							am re-examining all my papers having reference to those transactions to
							bring all the facts as fresh as possible to my recollection— I suspect
							Harris has been more successful in his expedients to ward the testimony
							of others.</p>

							here. It is a convenient practice for men who wish to keep themselves
							forever in the public eye— It is for such men a triple alliance of
							Flattery, Vanity and Egotism— The toast is always a fulsome compliment
							to the man, made to his face, and he makes it the occasion to manifest
							his rosy pudency in receiving it, and then delivering another
							semi-transparent panegyric upon himself, filled with professions of his
							gratitude, and his patriotic principles. Clay makes it also an occasion
							for doling out his politics in driblets— It gives what they call in
							England a clever man an opportunity of saying smart things and setting
							clap-traps, but in England when they have once begun, they go round the
							table— Every body is toasted, and <pb type="ms" n="555"/>every body
							makes a Speech of acknowledgment— It is a mixture of wit and dulness,
							eloquence and nonsense, which I always found exceedingly irksome and
							tedious. And there is always one general character belonging to it, and
							inseparable from it, that of disgusting egotism.</p>

								>President’s</persRef>, and he told me that he had thoughts of

								<persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Caesar A. Rodney</persRef> of Delaware,
							and <persRef ref="johnson-chapman">Chapman Johnson</persRef> of
							Virginia— I had some days since recommended King, <persRef
								ref="hay-george">George Hay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Eligius Fromentin</persRef>— The President
							now told me, that besides the difficulty of the family relation
							subsisting between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay and him, this
							appointment had been made quite an affair of party in Virginia, and he
							had recommendations very numerously signed for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hay on one side, and for this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Johnson on the other. I had never heard the name of Chapman Johnson
							before; but I told the President that as he was a Virginian, his
							qualifications could not but be well known to him, and I should be
							perfectly well-satisfied with his appointment. But that I hoped he would
							reflect further before he should appoint M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rodney, whom I knew to be an amiable, and able man, but whom I thought
							of an unsteady, somewhat weak, and rather unsafe character— He wanted
							both firmness and judgment. He had been sometime Attorney-General, and
							resigned that Office, as I had heard, dissatisfied without cause. He had
							been then sent as one of the three Commissioners to Buenos-Ayres— In
							that service, he had quarreled with one of his Colleagues, and had a
							misunderstanding with the other— He had disagreed with <persRef
								ref="graham-john">Graham</persRef>, one of the mildest and most
							prudent of men— Had evaded in no very handsome manner making a joint
							Report with him; so that instead of one unanimous Report, exhibiting a
							fair and well-observed statement of the actual condition of the Country
							to which they had been sent, from which safe and useful conclusions
							might have been drawn for the guidance of our own policy, we had three
							Reports, as to the most important points of observation conflicting with
							each other; and like the briefs of lawyers on the opposite sides of the
							same question. Of these Reports that of Rodney was all panegyric— He had
							seen nothing but what was to be admired— It fell in with and flattered
							the current of popular delusion, which partially prevailed here, and
							served as effectually as it could the factious opposition which <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was
							struggling to raise against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							Administration— The subsequent events at Buenos-Ayres had so thoroughly
							contradicted the whole substance of this Report, as to have demonstrated
							to my mind, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney’s discernment had
							either been blind folded by his prejudices, or had been too obtuse to
							see that which was immediately before him. In either case, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney upon that Mission had not served,
							but greatly disserved the Administration, which had employed him— He had
							therefore no claim upon it for further employment. His conduct on that
							occasion had manifested qualities both <pb type="ms" n="556"/>of mind
							and temper peculiarly unsuited to the office of a Commissioner under the
							Florida Treaty. The President said it had not occurred to him to review
							the conduct of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney; but he would
							reflect upon it further— I was occupied in making out the Commissions
							for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, which are
							three—one as Governor of the Florida’s—one as Commissioner for receiving
							them; and one with special powers, which may be required by particular
							exigencies: and also his Instructions— The Precedents in the case of
							Louisiana were consulted, and so far as they were applicable, followed—
							There was an extraordinary change of weather this day—<persRef

						<p><date>19. VI:</date> There was a <persRef ref="bedwell-thomas">M<hi

							from Philadelphia, to make application for an appointment as Consul, at

								Forsyth</persRef> called at the Office being upon the point of

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, attended by all
							the members of the Administration excepting <persRef ref="wirt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the
							Attorney-General who is confined by illness— The object of the Meeting
							was to determine what should be done with regard to the fortifications
							upon Dauphin Island at the Mouth of the Mississippi river. They are part
							of an extensive system for fortifying the whole Coast of the United
							States, for their protection in the event of any future war, against
							such invasions as we suffered in the last War with England. The
							President who formed this project, chiefly from the experience of the
							defenceless state of the Country in that War, had set his heart upon its
							accomplishment, and looks to it as one of the great objects by which his
							administration may be signalized in the view of posterity. Large
							appropriations <pb type="ms" n="557"/>have been made to effect it, for
							several successive years by Congress; but now, in the penury of the
							Treasury, and the passion for retrenchment they have not only reduced
							the amount of appropriations but withheld them for the fulfilment of
							contracts already made— For that of Dauphind Island in particular. It
							happens that there is a balance of a former appropriation, unexpended,
							of which Congress were not aware when they passed this Military
							Appropriation Act— The person who has made the contract for finishing
							the works and has consequently made provision of the materials and
							engaged the workmen, may be ruined by the failure on the part of the
							public to perform the contract; and the question was whether this
							unexpended balance of appropriation for another object may now be
							applied to the fulfilment of this contract, thus proceeding to complete
							the works, contrary to the sense of Congress, so strongly manifested by
							their withholding the Appropriation— The opinions went various upon it.
							One of the reasons upon which Congress withheld the appropriation was an
							opinion that the fortifications at that place would be useless, though
							recommended by a board of able engineers who have been for years
							employed in surveying the whole Coast for the special purpose of fixing
							upon the sites proper to be selected with a view to a system of defence.
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> the Secretary at War seemed inclined to think that
							this unexpended balance might be applied to the fulfilment of the
							contract for the Dauphin Island fortification, in the confidence that
							Congress at their next Session would review their opinion and approve
							the expenditure— The President not only adheres to the opinion of the
							usefulness and importance of the works, but feels a deep interest in
							their continuance as necessary to the completion of his design. The
							injury to the public interest by the abandonment of the works in their
							unfinished state; the double cost which must be occasioned by canceling
							the contract already made and resuming the work hereafter, the flagrant
							wrong to the contractor by breaking the contract with him, and leaving
							him with all his collected materials, and engaged labourers upon his
							hands were all taken into consideration. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> according to his
							custom gave no direct opinion, but spoke of the impression of Congress,
							and particularly of <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S.
								Smith</persRef>, Chairman of the late Committee of Ways and Means of
							the House, at whose instance the appropriation was struck out, that
							these works would be useless, because there was not depth of water for
							any naval force to approach within reach of the battery; and Crawford
							himself countenanced this idea. Calhoun strongly contested it, and to me
							it was quite incredible that a board of Engineers specially commissioned
							to survey the whole coast and select spots for defence should have
							committed such an egregious blunder— The board too consisting of
							distinguished Officers, and their report being admired, as of the first
							ability. I was nevertheless of opinion that the unexpended balance
							should not be applied to this expenditure— For, it could not regularly
							be so applied. And Congress with a full knowledge of all the
							Circumstances having refused the appropriation, to apply other money for
							the object reprobated by them would bring the executive in direct
							conflict with them, the Executive not having the law on its side— The
							position would be the most unfavourable possible for such a contest, and
							from the disposition manifested by the last Congress, I had no doubt the
							next would be still more stimulated to make a quarrel with the
							Executive— If it must come, I thought it very desirable should have all
							the aid that it can derive from the Law. As to the additional expence of
							abandoning and resuming the work, Congress and not the Executive must be
							responsible for that— It was doubtful to me, whether they would resume
							it at all— As to the wrong suffered by the individual in the failure of
							his contract, it was most respectful to Congress to suppose that when
							the case shall be properly brought before them, they will make suitable
							provision to indemnify him, so that the public faith may be preserved—
							It was finally determined that the <pb type="ms" n="558"/>balance of
							money should not be applied to this object— But the contractor should be
							informed that the opinion and wish of the president is in favour of
							continuing the work; and that this will be made known to Congress at
							their next Session— That if the contractor chooses to proceed upon the
							work with this view, and by means of his own funds, the Executive
							considers the contract as binding upon the United States, although
							Congress alone can provide the means of its fulfilment— <persRef
