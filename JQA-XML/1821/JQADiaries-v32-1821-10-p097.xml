						<p><date>1. VI.</date> This Morning <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, with my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>,
							and the domestics <persRef ref="elizabeth3"
							>Elizabeth</persRef><space/>and <persRef ref="abbott-joseph">Joseph
								Abbot</persRef> the Coachman, left <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								fathers</persRef> House at Quincy to return to our own residence at
							the City of Washington— As she travels with our own carriage, and of
							course slowly, we agreed that they should depart this day, and proceed
							by such Stages as to reach New-London on Thursday; and I am to overtake
							them there, by going in the Stage of that day from Boston— We propose to
							proceed thence together in the Steam-Boats to New-York, sending the
							carriage and horses round by land— From New-York, I am to proceed
							immediately, having written to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> that my purpose is to
							reach Washington, the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month.
							My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went with
								<persRef ref="shaw-william">W. S. Shaw</persRef> in the Stage to
							Boston, and thence to Cambridge where the term at the University
							effectually commences this day. After bespeaking a seat in the Stage to
							Boston for to-morrow Morning, I went with <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to Boston and thence to Cambridge— I stopped at
								<persRef ref="kirkland-john">President Kirkland’s</persRef>, and
							spoke to him on the subject of my Sons— I told him I had been much
							mortified and surprized at discovering their low standing as Scholars in
							their classes. I asked him if there had been any thing exceptionable in
							their moral conduct? He said, absolutely nothing— He had never heard so
							much as a word against either of them. This, I told him was a great
							consolation to me— But it was best to deal perfectly in candour with
							him— My eldest Son, left the University, with a deep impression, that
							justice had not been done him other in the standing attributed to him,
							or in the part assigned to him at Commencement: and I shared with him in
							the opinion— He stood rated in his Class number 30—and his part was one
							of the lowest, assigned for the day. Now I would advert to the following
							facts— At the Boylston prize-declamations of the last year, George took
							the first prize— His performance on Commencement day, was distinguished
							as one of the best, by the public approbation, and even noticed as such
							in the public Journals— But one of his Classmates who on the recitation
							lists stood within the first twenty had applied to George to write his
							part for him; George wrote it; and it was actually delivered— When
							George presented to <persRef ref="channing-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing</persRef> before Commencement
							his own part, it was returned to him without remark either of
							approbation or censure— But when the part which had been written by
							George for his friend, was brought up to the professor, he had in
							returning it, expressed himself of it, in terms of high commendation—
							Dr. Kirkland said that one subject might present more opportunity for
							elegant composition than another— I was aware of that, and added that
							neither of these incidents was decisive in itself— It was the
							combination of them which wrought upon me— He said he had thought George
							was satisfied with the standing and the part assigned to him. I assured
							him it was far otherwise; but that as he had finished his career at the
							University, I should not have complained, but that I have yet two Sons
							there, for whom it is my duty to obtain Justice— I had been informed
							that John had at the close of his freshman year received a private
							admonition for neglect of his studies. This was cause of deep regret to
							me, because I must presume he had deserved it— But he and his brother
							had both solemnly assured me that he had since that time been a close
							and regular student. Yet I found his standing had been raised no more
							than from 47 to 45. And his mark upon recitation to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing was among the very lowest, rating
							him at 5—while in fact he had declared to me, that he had a peculiar
							fondness for that study, and would appeal to his whole class, whether he
							had not been constant in his attendance and correct in his recitations—
							If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing’s mark had been, as I
							believed it ought to have been at least 9. that would have raised John’s
							standing upon the general scale above 40. And now upon my son Charles’s
							examination, it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing again who
							fixed upon him the stigma, of a Condition— It had been my fortune two
							years ago, quite unwillingly, but from the conviction of duty to be made
							the vehicle of communications to the Board of Overseers, objecting
							against his appointment of professor of Rhetoric and Oratory— I supposed
							this was known to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing. I was
							unwilling to believe that <pb type="ms" n="98"/>he indulged his
							resentments against me by injustice to my children— Yet this peculiar
							severity applied to them all, could not be without a cause— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Kirkland said he hoped that no such
							prejudice would operate upon the mind of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Channing— That as to John, it was the usage of the Government not to
							give the Parents of the young men notice of the first admonition; but
							they did give notice when there was occasion for the second. He shewed
							me that John’s mark in Greek, the recitation of which was to <persRef
								ref="popkin-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Popkin</persRef>,
							rated him still lower than he was rated in rhetoric by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing. He said if he had lately studied
							more, without much rising, it might be owing to his frequent absences
							upon leave; which though not subjecting him to punishment, could not but
							have an effect upon his recitations. He said it was John’s principle,
							and that of many others, to avail themselves of every indulgence and
							relaxation which could escape from actual punishment. With this
							principle they may pass through college, but cannot make distinguished
							Scholars. I finally said that having disburthened my mind, I should wait
							for the result of another year; I hoped I should have no further cause
							even for suspicion of injustice towards my sons. Should it be otherwise
							it would be very painful to me to remove them; but my duty to them would
							require it. I could not witness their mortifications, and
							discouragements, from partialities operating against them upon their
							teachers; and would place them elsewhere— I then went to John’s chamber,
							and took leave of him and Charles—told them they were to pass their next
							Winter vacation, at my fathers at Quincy— That I should expect they
							would both pursue their studies steadily and assiduously— That the
							winter after next if I should then be still residing at Washington, my
							permission to them to come there would depend upon their standing as
							Scholars, but it must be much higher than that now held by John— I
							enjoined upon them a persevering attendance upon all the exercise, and
							forbad them to take out their names for absence even to go to Quincy
							during the term— I saw they were much affected, John especially by the
							loss of the visit to Washington next Winter, but my determination was
							taken, and they did not venture to remonstrate— I went immediately to
								<persRef ref="reed-reuben">Read’s</persRef> for my Chaise; came to
							Roxbury where I dined with <persRef ref="amory-rufus">R. G.
								Amory</persRef>, and in the Evening returned to my father’s house at
							Quincy— There was a party of fourteen or fifteen Gentlemen, at Amory’s,
							among whom were <persRef ref="davis-john">judge Davis</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="prescott-william">W. Prescott</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="livermore-edward">E. S. L. Livermore</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="stockton-robert">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								Stockton</persRef>, whom I agreed to meet to-morrow Morning at ten
							O’Clock, in Boston— I rode in a heavy rain almost the whole of this
							day.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:30.</date> This was a training day at Quincy, and all the
							neighbourhood was under arms or upon the field— The Stage in which I had
							engaged a seat did not go to Boston, but they sent me in a Chaise in its
							stead— I passed through regiments of militia from <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> house to Neponset Bridge, and
							crowds of Spectators, flocking by their sides— I reached <persRef
								ref="jenks-alice">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jenks’s</persRef>
							just in time to meet <persRef ref="stockton-robert">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Stockton</persRef> at ten. He gave me
							the written statement of particulars respecting the capture by him of
							four Schooners on the Coast of Africa, under French Colours— He also
							shewed me a very polite note from <persRef ref="sullivan-william2"
								>William Sullivan</persRef>, with a summons to appear on the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of <hi rend="italic">next</hi> October
							before the Circuit Court at Boston, to answer for the capture of the
							Schooner Eliza; damages bid at twenty thousand dollars. Stockton said
							that as it was deferred till October next he should have time enough for
							preparation; but I told him it was merely a mistake of the clerk in
							making out the summons, and that the time of appearance was the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the present month; but as he was not
							held to bail, he would not be personally detained, but might go to Sea,
							and appear in Court by his Attorney. As to the delivery of the captured
							vessel now here to the <persRef ref="devalnais-joseph">French
								Consul</persRef>, he said he should not object to it, if he was
							considered as relieved from all responsibility for the capture. He is
							now under sailing orders and expects to go in a few days. He told me he
							proposed to go to Quincy and see my father, at his invitation to-morrow—
							After this <pb type="ms" n="99"/>interview, I called upon <persRef
								ref="dearborn-henry">General Dearborn</persRef> the elder, according
							to appointment at 11. O’Clock; and found with him his son in Law,
								<persRef ref="wingate-joshua">General Wingate</persRef>— This
							Gentleman is an inhabitant of the State of Maine and was an unsuccessful
							candidate, at the recent election of Governor there. In this contest the
							late <persRef ref="king-william">Governor King</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>
							took part against him, and in favour of judge <persRef
								ref="parris-albion">Albion K. Parris</persRef>, who was elected.
							This will occasion a vacancy of the office of U.S. District judge, and
							General Dearborn told me he was apprehensive there would be efforts
							made, to precipitate the appointment of <persRef ref="ware-asher">Ashur
								Ware</persRef>, now Secretary of State in Maine, as District Judge.
							He said he had written to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, suggesting to him the wish that the
							appointment might be deferred until the meeting of the Legislature in
							Maine; when the wishes of a majority of the members might be consulted
							in the appointment of the judge— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ware was
							not a proper person for that office— He was a young man who had not been
							more than five years a resident in the State, having had very little
							experience or reputation as a lawyer— There were two other persons
							either of them better qualified for and suited to the place— <persRef
								ref="whitman-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitman</persRef>, a federalist, but a man of talents, a sound
							lawyer, of irreproachable character—and <persRef ref="ames-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>now Speaker of the House
								of Representative</persRef>, an eminent lawyer, and whose
							appointment would give general satisfaction— But the appointment of
							Ware, would be, as the election of Parris had been a part of the system
							for securing the election of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, as successor to
							the present President— To this end the vote of the State of Maine, was
							considered as of very great importance— About three years ago, he
							understood <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rufus King</persRef> wrote a letter to his brother <persRef
								ref="king-william">William</persRef>, expressing the opinion that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford would carry the next
							election—for President, by the superiority of his talent for
							electioneering management— William King thereupon immediately determined
							to be of the strongest side; went to Richmond in Virginia, where he made
							his arrangements— Then returned home, stopping at Washington City, where
							he was promised in the event of success, the Office of Secretary of War,
							the great object of his ambition.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes
							has since been secured by the promise of a foreign Mission, and <persRef
								ref="chandler-john">General Chandler</persRef> by his connections
							with the others; and now King since his return from Washington last
							June, has been canvassing the State openly and with such profusion of
							promises that it reminded him of a recruiting Officer, who always
							enlisted men by promising every individual that he should be made a
							Sergeant. He had no doubt that if they should succeed not one officer of
							the United States within the State, removable by the Executive would be
							suffered to keep his place— Every one would be turned out— But there
							were not enough of them—there were ten promises or more for every
							office, and the disappointments would be so much more numerous than the
							fulfilments, that ultimately there would be more enemies made than
							partizans— But his object in asking to see me before my return to the
							seat of Government was to caution me, with regard to my relations with
							these men— I might rely upon it, they would keep a continual watch upon
							me, and would snatch at any thing I might do or say that they could
							possibly turn to my disadvantage— I told the General that I was obliged
							to him for his kindness. That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. King had
							long been canvassing for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford in the
							State of Maine, was well known to me, and that he had freely assigned
							that Gentleman’s superior talent for political management, as the
							presage of his success, I had also heard— Of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Holmes my information had not been so positive, but from his
							late coalition with King, and the part he had taken in the late State
							Election of Maine, I had inferred what his course would be with regard
							to the next Presidential Election. I could certainly not answer that I
							should always be so guarded in my conduct, as to give them no power to
							injure me, if they should be so disposed— I ought not to expect it from
							them; but I was aware that my security would only be in proportion to my
							discretion. As to the appointment of District judge I had no doubt the
							President would use due deliberation before making it. The General asked
							if there was any person at Washington, to whom he could write freely,
							should any thing occur, of which he might wish to give me information— I
							said perhaps some one of the Representatives from the State, but I was
							not acquainted with the new Members. Wingate mentioned <pb type="ms"
								n="100"/><persRef ref="herrick-ebenezer">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Herrick</persRef> as a well disposed man; I said
								<persRef ref="hill-mark">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M. L.
								Hill</persRef>, so far as inferences could be drawn from his
							Conversation was a trusty person— They said he would be too much under
							the influence of the others— General Dearborn, asked me, whether
								<persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>, might be considered as a confidential man— I told
							him, entirely so— This conversation was of about two hours duration, and
							I have only here minuted its material points. Dearborn, and Wingate are
							irritated, not only at the failure of the latter, but at the coarseness
							and intemperance with which King and Holmes have carried on the
							electioneering campaign against him— Whether King has been so prodigal
							of his promises, and whether he or Holmes have received such promises as
							Dearborn affirms, I pause, absolutely to believe; but that King, from
							selfish motives, and from his confidence in Crawford’s superior talent,
							at political intrigue, has made himself his partizan, and drawn Holmes
							into the same course, I have no doubt. That in producing this result,
							Rufus King gave the first impulse to his brother is new to me, but not
							surprizing— Rufus King has himself been, and wishes again to be a
							candidate for the presidency; and although personally a friend of mine
							of long standing, he is not unwilling to guard against the possibility
							of my standing in his way. This is not the first occasion upon which I
							have felt the effects of this disposition— Yet I do not agree to the
							characteristic which <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> gave me of
							him last Spring—that he was “a hollow-hearted, insincere man.” He is
							upright in principle; and occasionally frail in practice— Leaving
							General Dearborn’s, I met <persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Cruft</persRef> in the Street,
							and called with him at the Fire and Marine Insurance Office— Thence I
							went to the Marlborough Hotel, and engaged a seat in the Stage for
							New-London, for Thursday Morning. As it starts from the House at 3. in
							the morning, I bespoke a lodging for to-morrow night— Dined with
								<persRef ref="hall-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hall</persRef> the Sheriff— Besides his family the only other guest
							present was <persRef ref="amory-n">Nath<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Amory.</persRef><persRef ref="degrand-peter">De Grand</persRef>
							called there after dinner to remind me that I had promised to meet him
							and a Committee of Memorialists to the President; it had entirely
							escaped my Memory. I promised to meet them to-morrow Evening at seven. I
							sent to <persRef ref="spurr-zephaniah">Spurr’s</persRef> for a horse and
							Chaise, and calling at <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Welsh’s</persRef> persuaded <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet</persRef> to go with me out to Quincy,
							to pass the remainder of the week at my father’s. We met multitudes of
							Carriages, returning from the training, all the way from the Neck to
							Neponset Bridge; and thence to my father’s house were annoyed by the
							straggling militia men, and fragments of companies returning home after
							the review. <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Marston</persRef> and <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> passed the Evening
							with us at my father’s. Marston stated to me in a very pathetic manner
							his distressed circumstances which I wish, it were in my power to
							relieve.</p>

							that I was obliged to leave the Settlement incomplete— He will forward

							said to me, “be thou faithful, as thou hast been, unto the death, and
							thou shalt surely have a crown of glory, here and hereafter.” I was too

							took up another, a <persRef ref="newman-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Newman</persRef>— From Providence we travelled by a new
							Turnpike road, over an extraordinarily barren and desolate country 17

							New-London, with the Steamboat Passengers— Among them was <persRef
								ref="king-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> William
								King</persRef> the Commissioner of Spanish Claims, returning from
							the second adjournment of the Commission— He told me there was great
							sickliness prevailing at Washington—but that <persRef

								ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy’s</persRef> daughter
								<persRef ref="thompson-louisa">Louisa</persRef> had so far recovered
							that he had left Washington, with his family for New-York— After dinner
							we proceeded 18 Miles to Stonington; nearly the whole way within sight

							and found M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams had lodged there last
							Night. Thence we came 16 Miles, and crossing the Thames, alighted at
								<persRef ref="shepherd-unknown">Shepherd’s</persRef> tavern in
							New-London, just at 9 in the Evening— Here I found my wife and family,
							as well as I could have expected, with the exception of the <persRef

							violent fever, and to whom a physician, <persRef ref="perkins-nathaniel"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Perkins</persRef> had been

							and belongs to New-York— We arrived at New-Haven about 3. in the

								ref="stiles-ezra">Stiles</persRef> and <persRef ref="dwight-timothy"

							unceasing sarcasms upon the female sex, and caustic Satire upon some of

							through Princeton 28 Miles to Trenton, which we reached about 9 in the

							with him <persRef ref="chew-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Benjamin Chew</persRef> came in— Towards evening I called at
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef>,
							and not finding him at home, at his brother <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll’s</persRef>, with whom I
							had some conversation concerning the cause of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="lewis-william">W. D. Lewis</persRef>. I left with him <persRef
								ref="hurd-john">J. R. Hurd’s</persRef> Letter to me of <space/>
							September 1817. and requested him to have a supplementary deposition of
							Hurd taken to prove that he did write me that Letter. The trial is to
							come on in November. While I was with Ingersoll, <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-jared">his father</persRef> came in; and afterwards
							his brother Charles, with whom I walked to his house. I had received
							from him a few days before I left Boston, a Letter, requesting me to
							call on him as I should pass through Philadelphia, for something
							concerning which he wished to speak to me; and to dine with him— But
							learning on my arrival here that <persRef ref="ingersoll-mary">his
								wife</persRef> had been a few days since almost dying, and was yet
							confined to her bed with this raging disease, I had concluded he could
							with no convenience receive company to dinner, and had conditionally
							promised J. Sergeant to dine to-morrow with him— The point upon which
							Ingersoll had wished to speak to me was this— He asked me whether, at
							the Negotiation of the Treaty of Ghent, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had
							proposed to grant to the British the right of navigating the Mississippi
							River, as a compensation for an extension of our right to the fisheries.
							I said no— <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had made no such proposition— But
							that the British Plenipotentiaries had notified to us <pb type="ms"
								n="104"/>that they considered our rights of fishing within the
							British provincial jurisdiction, stipulated by an Article of the Treaty
							of Peace of 1783 as annulled by the War, and that they would not renew
							that Article. At the same time they demanded an Article in the proposed
							Treaty, securing to them the right of navigating the Mississippi— Our
							answer insisted that the Treaty of Peace of 1783 was not and could not
							be annulled by the War. That to pretend otherwise would be to say that
							our Independence was annulled by the War— But in that Treaty of 1783.
							there was a stipulation that the British should enjoy forever the right
							of navigating the Mississippi, and holding as we did that Treaty to be
							binding we declined agreeing to any new stipulation to that effect— In
							the course of the discussion we made a proposal to the British
							Plenipotentiaries, to adjust the difference by renewing both the
							Articles— To this <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> objected, but he finally signed the Note
							which made the offer, Saying that he reserved to himself the right, if
							the whole Treaty should displease him finally to decline signing it—
							There was another proposal <hi rend="strikethrough">of the British</hi>,
							to renew an Article of <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jay’s</persRef> Treaty giving access to the British
							traders from Canada, to the Indians within our Territories. To this
								<unclear>. . . .</unclear> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							declared that if it should be agreed to, and also the Article giving
							them the Navigation of the Mississippi, he would not sign the Treaty.
								<unclear>. . . .</unclear><hi rend="strikethrough">would have signed
								the Treaty to include both the Articles</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Clay wished to give prodigious importance, to this British
							right of navigating the Mississippi, and fancied they would eagerly
							snatch at it, as an equivalent for the old fishing Article— But the
							truth was that they set so little value by it that they rejected our
							proposal without hesitation; and offered us a counter-proposal, to <hi
								rend="italic">renounce</hi> the rights on both sides, which we in
							our turn rejected, and I then declared if it should be accepted that <hi
								rend="italic">I</hi> would not sign the Treaty— Ingersoll said that
							it was intended to make use of this incident upon a future occasion
							against me. And that I shall be charged as specially the person who
							would have yielded to the British the right of navigating the
							Mississippi, for an extension of the fisheries— I said I had no doubt it
							would be used against me, wherever and whenever it could serve a turn.
							It had already been used against me in the Kentucky newspapers, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay in one of his speeches to the House
							of Representatives in Congress had made a statement of this incident,
							not in the most candid manner. For he had represented the proposal for
							allowing to the British the Navigation of the Mississippi, as having
							been made by <hi rend="italic">a Majority</hi>, of the American
							Plenipotentiaries, he being in the minority, without acknowledging that
							he had signed the note by which the offer was made, and without
							disclosing how very lightly the concession of which he would fain make
							so much was estimated by the British, and how promptly they had rejected
							it— But in fact I was not the person who made the proposal for renewing
							the two Articles; it originated with <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, who knew and
							insisted that it could never be any thing to the British but a mere
							naked right, and of no more detriment to us than use to them— I told
							Ingersoll that I could shew him at Washington, in my private papers, all
							the documents exhibiting the true state of this affair, including the
							copy of the Note to the British Plenipotentiaries, containing the
							proposal, signed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, as well as by
							all the other American Commissioners— Ingersoll released me from the
							engagement to dine with him to-morrow, on account of his wife’s illness.
							I came back to my lodgings, about nine in the Evening.</p>

							I saw <persRef ref="walsh-unknown">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u;u">two children</persRef>. He was already at his office.
							Called next at <persRef ref="ewing-samuel">S. Ewing’s</persRef>, and
							found him indisposed, having had a slight return of his fever— Then at
							the Athenaeum, where I met <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef> of Louisiana, and
								<persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duponceau</persRef>— Found Walsh at his office and had an hour’s
							conversation with him. He spoke of the state of public affairs in
							New-York, where the Convention is yet sitting at Albany, and where there
							is said to be as much canvassing for the next Presidential election, as
							repairing of Constitutions. He says that <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt"
								>De Witt Clinton</persRef> is politically speaking so completely
							broken down that he can never rise again. That in his private concerns
							he has a debt of 70000 dollars upon which from day to day he can
							scarcely keep the sheriff from his door; and that all his friends give
							up his case as absolutely desperate.— Walsh said also that Clinton had
							made last year a very foolish attack upon the National Administration,
							which he had utterly failed of supporting. But he added that New-York
							was of all the States in the Union, that most addicted to political
							bargaining and he thought the ultimate influence of the State would
							altogether depend upon caballing combinations. He hinted that it might
							very possibly be for <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>— He said there were now occasionally breaking
							out in the Newspapers, in various parts of the Country, articles looking
							forward to the next Presidential election— Their general tenour was that
							it was too soon to open the discussion— But he was for breaking ground
							at no distant period; against the intriguing, bargaining, caucussing
							system, which is already in full operation— Walsh spoke likewise of the
							critiques which have appeared upon my fourth of July Address, and of his
							own comments upon it in the National Gazette of which he is the Editor;
							and he mentioned a series of numbers now in the course of publication,
							upon my Report on Weights and Measures. The reviewer was he said a
								<persRef ref="plitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Plitt</persRef>—a man well disposed, and familiar with the subject—
							From Walsh’s Office, I returned to <persRef ref="shinn-elizabeth">Miss

							Visits from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>, of the
							Michigan territory, and <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General
								Macomb</persRef>.— A young Frenchman by the name of <persRef
								ref="laborie-unknown">Laborie</persRef>, brought me two Letters from
							the <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Prince de Talleyrand</persRef>;
							one, thanking me, for the copy which I sent him of my Report upon

							Laborie himself. At the Office <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward
								Wyer</persRef> called; and <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef>, the British
							Minister— He came to enquire, whether we could deliver up a certain
							Captain of a British fishing vessel, belonging to the Island of
							Newfoundland; who ran away with his vessel, and her fare of fish, and
							after disposing of part of his Cargo by smuggling on our Coast, entered
							one of our Eastern ports; and was there seized for a breach of our
							Revenue Laws— The crime of which this man is impeached is a Statute
							piracy, both by the British Laws, and our own. But our tribunals can
							take cognizance only of offences against our own Law, which can operate
							only upon offences within our jurisdiction; they cannot try this man,
							either upon our Statute, which he has not, or upon the British Statute
							which he has transgressed. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							that I thought we could not deliver up this man; and referred him to
							several cases of a similar character which have occurred before. He made
							some question as to the obligation by the Laws of Nations, to deliver up
							atrocious criminals—and referred to a passage in Vattel to that effect—
							I admitted that there was such a passage in <persRef ref="vattel-emer"
								>Vattel</persRef>; but said it was voluntary Law. In practice,
							Nations did as they pleased, some did, and some did not deliver up
							foreign criminals. England I believed did not— I mentioned to him the
							case of the pirates and murderers, on board the Schooner Plattsburg.
							Four of these were taken up in Denmark; one in Sweden; one in France and
							one in Prussia. We had demanded the delivery of them all; Denmark and
							Sweden had delivered; and we had tried, convicted, and <persRef
								ref="williams-john2;frederick-francis;peterson-nils;rog-john"
								type="multi">executed the men</persRef>— But France and Prussia, had
							refused to deliver; France alledging that she could deliver only after
							proof of the man’s guilt, which could be proved only by the trial, and
							Prussia, which took the trouble of sending the man from Dantzig to
							Elseneur, where ample testimony was produced against him, still refused
							to deliver him up because he did not confess his guilt— But with us the
							question was of the authority to deliver up— The Executive had no such
							authority; and if a warrant to take up the man should issue, the first
							judge upon whom he should call, would discharge him upon a
							Habeas-Corpus— [“]Ay, said Canning, this comes of a Republican
							Government.” Why, said I, we must take Republican Government like
							others, for better for worse: the personal security of individuals is a
							favourite object of Republican Government, but the want of authority was
							not confined to them. It had been the answer given by the Governor of
							Canada, to our application for the delivery of fugitive Slaves— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning had not been informed of this. I
							told him, if in this case he should make an application, I presumed the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would refer it to
							the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> for a Report;
							but to save time I would send his papers to the Attorney General before
							transmitting them to the President— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning mentioned the case of a man named <persRef
								ref="milligan-unknown">Milligan</persRef>, charged with forging Bank
							Bills, in the State of New-York, who had been delivered up by the
							Government of Canada, but I was not acquainted with any of the
							particulars of the affair—nor was he. I walked this Evening with
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, down to
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							has also been dangerously ill, and <persRef

							told me that 17 persons have been affected by it in his family more or
							less— Many of them after apparent recovery have relapsed two, and some
							of them three times— They are now all convalescent, excepting his second
							son, <persRef ref="crawford-nathaniel">Macon</persRef>— He himself rides
							out, and is able to attend to business; but complains that he has not
							yet recovered his appetite, and said that yesterday for the first time,
							he found his usual symptom of health; a relish for a glass of cold
							water. Trimble is going to Boston— He is very lately from Kentucky;
							where, and in all the Western Country it has been as sickly as in this
							neighbourhood— Trimble said he had himself but just recovered from a
							severe bilious fever— On returning home I resumed my Diary and wrote
							till dinner time. Spent the Evening at <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s</persRef> alone with him—
							Conversation chiefly upon the recent incidents in Florida— <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Judge Fromentin</persRef>, and the late
							Spanish Governor, and <persRef ref="callava-jose">Commissioner
								Callava</persRef>— Jackson committed Callava to prison. Fromentin
							issued a writ of Habeas Corpus, with the intention of discharging
							Callava— Jackson summoned Fromentin before him to answer for having
							interfered with his authority— Fromentin first alledged sickness for not
							going; and afterwards went; not as he alledges, in obedience to the
							summons, but merely to give amicable explanations— There were violent
							scenes of altercations, between the parties; Callava has published a
							long protest against Jackson’s proceedings in the newspapers— Jackson
							and Fromentin have complained of each other to the Government, and all
							the newspapers are full of discussion upon the subject; generally taking
							side against Jackson, because they have seen hitherto little, but on one
							side of the questions— Among the rest the Richmond Enquirer a paper
							edited with considerable ability, and the organ of the new Virginia
							faction, under the auspices of <persRef ref="roane-spencer">Spenser
								Roane</persRef>, chief Justice of that State has come out with great
							virulence— The Enquirer, under constant professions of esteem for
							Jackson’s public services has always betrayed a rancorous and malignant
							hostility against him. But Wirt has been himself heretofore a
							Correspondent of the Richmond Enquirer, and almost worships Spenser
							Roane— He is therefore alarmed at these premature ebullitions of the
							Press, and thinks there ought to be some anonymous counter publication
							in the National Intelligencer, to shield the Administration from
							censure. Wirt is inclined to think Jackson has been wrong, both in
							sending Callava to prison, and in summoning Fromentin before him— He
							thinks they were both priviledged persons— Callava, as the Spanish
							Commissioner, and Fromentin as a judge— I mentioned to him that Jackson
							had objected to the writ of Habeas Corpus, as issued illegally in form
							even if Fromentin had the right to issue it. Wirt said there could be no
							doubt that it was irregularly issued— Wirt thinks that the <persRef

							soon as possible; to determine upon the course to be pursued in this

							also claimed like privileges for the vessels of the Island of S<hi

							much concerned. He thinks that the President ought to come immediately
							to the City, and determine upon the course to be pursued by the
							Administration, in these cases— I concur in that opinion— Calhoun fears
							that a wrong direction may be given to public sentiments, on these
							transactions by the Spirit of faction, and the crude precipitancy of
							newspaper Commentaries— Calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind; of
							honourable principles: of clear and quick understanding: of cool
							self-possession; of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent
							patriotism— He is above all sectional, and factious prejudices, more
							than any other Statesman of this Union, with whom I have ever acted. He
							is more sensitive to the transient manifestations of momentary public
							opinion, more afraid of the first impressions of the public opinion than
							I am— In all cases of controvertible conduct in public men; when the
							conclusion upon the whole subject is more favourable than its first
							aspect, the more hastily and the more virulently they are in the first
							instance attacked, the more strong and effectual is the final recoil in
							their favour. In such cases I think the true policy is to let the
							hostile portion of the public Journals extravagate to their hearts
							content— Let them waste their strength, and emit all their venom, upon
							misapplications of Law, and perversions of fact; and when the victory is
							upon the balance, seize and turn their batteries against themselves—
								<persRef ref="watkins-tobias">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tobias
								Watkins</persRef> the Secretary to the Commission upon Spanish
							Claims, called upon me this Evening, and had much conversation with me,
							concerning the proceedings of the Commissioners. He said he was
							confident the whole amount of the claims to be provided for would fall
							short of five Millions of Dollars, which would he thought be creditable
							to the Administration, which had been censured for not stipulating to
							pay a large sum, as <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> had
							demanded— I told him of the alarm which had been caused at Salem and
							Philadelphia, by the <hi rend="italic">report</hi> that the
							Commissioners had decided not to admit any claim of Insurance Companies,
							or Underwriters. He said there had been no decision— The question had
							been reserved for argument. But two of the Commissioners, <persRef
								ref="white-hugh">White</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef> had so strongly
							expressed their opinions, that he was fully convinced no underwriter or
							insurance company would recover a <hi rend="italic">Cent</hi>. <persRef
								ref="king-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>
							indeed was in their favour— But the opinion of the two others was very
							strong against them— I asked upon what grounds?— He said because the
							underwriters had received large premiums, often 50 per Cent, for the
							risks— Because the <pb type="ms" n="110"/>Insurance Offices, had been
							more than compensated for their losses, by their profits; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Tazewell had another principle, namely
							that the Treaty provided for the claims only of American Citizens; and
							he did not know but some part of the Stock of Insurance Companies was
							owned by foreigners— Watkins said that Tazewell had written and
							discussed these and other questions arising from the Commission, in the
							form of dialogues— I told Watkins I hoped M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							White and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tazewell would reconsider their
							opinions before they pronounced upon the claims of Insurance companies.
							I believed their claims good according to the maritime Law— The
							underwriter by payment of the loss acquired all the rights of salvage,
							belonging to the owner. We had renounced his claim upon the Spanish
							Government, and it would be hard to deprive him of all remedy, there
							with one hand and deny it to them with another here. The claims of the
							Insurance companies were among the principal claims to be provided for—
							We had published them to the world as claims of our Citizens of Spain;
							and now if they should be excluded, they would immediately come back
							against us as Claims upon Spain which we should again be obliged to
							maintain; and what could we say to Spain to maintain them?— Or what upon
							the subtle device that among fifty or a hundred american owners of
							Stock, in an Insurance company there might be one or two foreigners?
							They would charge us with direct fraud; and I think very justly— Watkins
							mooted the point with me some time, and I advised him to read <persRef
								ref="park-james">Parke</persRef> and <persRef ref="marshall-john"
								>Marshall</persRef> and <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi
									rend="superscript">ths.</hi></persRef> Ordonnance de la Marine.
							He asked me, if I would commit to writing my ideas on the subject; but I
							declined, as it might have the appearance of interfering with the
							proceedings of the Commissioners— He said <persRef ref="pinkney-william"
								>W. Pinkney</persRef> was engaged to argue the question for the
							Insurance companies of Baltimore. I promised to refer to the cases of
							claims under the former Commissions both in France and England. He said
							the Commissioners had also decided that all the arguments should be in
							writing— But the counsel for one of the claimants had declared his wish
							to object to the admission of another claim; upon which Tazewell had
							said this was a new proposition, and it was further to be considered

								Middleton’s</persRef> arrival in Russia the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had been absent, and very lately

							arbitration had been brought before him; but I was assured M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton would not delay it. He asked
							upon what principle indemnity would be made if the decision should be in
							our favour— I said that indemnity for the mere value of the Slaves
							carried away, and only interest upon that value at the rate of six per
							Cent a year would be no adequate compensation for the loss. The increase
							of the Slave and the improvement of the <pb type="ms" n="111"
							/>plantation by his labour ought to be paid for— I told him I thought it
							would be difficult to ascertain; he said not at all. I said it was like
							a merchant’s claiming for indemnity, the profits of a voyage which he
							might have made; but he did not see the analogy— I asked him how he
							could say that any given slave would not have died, within a week after
							he had been carried away— He said he could not; but allowance might be
							made for that— I advised that his father should have his whole argument
							set forth in its utmost extent and forwarded to this Department, where
							all the use that could, would be made of it— He took leave giving me
							thanks for my attendance to the business. I called at <persRef

							last Summer that Roane was the author of the pieces signed Algernon
							Sidney, against the Supreme Court, and that they had been excited by the
							words “we command you” in the Mandamus, in the case of Cohens vs

								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>— All this is “close ambition
							varnished o’er with zeal.” Jefferson and Madison did attain power by
							organizing and heading a system of attack upon the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> Administration, chiefly
							under the banners of State rights and State Sovereignty— They argued and
							scolded against all implied powers, and pretended that the Government of
							the Union had no powers but such as were expressly delegated by the
							Constitution— They succeeded. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson
							was elected President of the United States, and the first thing he did
							was to purchase Louisiana. An assumption of implied power, greater in
							itself and more comprehensive in its consequences, than all the
							assumptions of implied powers, in the twelve years of the Washington and
								<persRef ref="adams-john">Adams</persRef> administrations put
							together. Through the sixteen years of the Jefferson and Madison
							Administrations not the least regard was paid to the doctrines of
							rejecting implied powers, upon which those Gentlemen had vaulted into
							the seat of Government, with the single exception that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison negatived a Bill for applying
							public money to the public internal improvement of the Country. But the
							same M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison signed a Bill for
							incorporating a Bank of the United States, against which he and all the
							Virginian party had stubbornly contended as Unconstitutional, because
								<hi rend="italic">express</hi> power was not given to the Congress
							to incorporate Banks— The Virginian opposition to implied powers
							therefore is a convenient weapon, to be taken up or laid aside as it
							suits the purposes of State turbulence and ambition; and as Virginia has
							no direct Candidate to offer for the next Presidential Election, her
							aspiring <pb type="ms" n="113"/>demagogues, are casting about them to
							place her again at the head of a formal opposition to the administration
							of the Union; that she may thus again obtain by conquest the
							administration itself. On the former occasion this attempt was greatly
							favoured by circumstances— It was favoured by its novelty— Favoured by
							the bad management of its adversaries. It has most of the same
							advantages now— They still possess in a superior degree the art of
							political management— They will be favoured by circumstances; and if not
							by novelty, yet by the success of the former example— The tactics of the
							former war are again resorted to, and Roane comes forth as the champion
							of Virginia— There was also among the papers a copy of the President’s
							answer to this Letter; declining a positive answer upon the special
							point of Roane’s assault; but giving countenance to it, by referring to
							his own resistance against the right of the general Government to make
							internal improvements— I called about seven this Evening at the
							President’s House to enquire if he had returned home. He had not
							arrived, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay, after waiting for him
							till that time, had just sat down to dinner— I came home and read in

							present— The transactions in Florida, were the subject of deliberation.
								<pb type="ms" n="114"/>There was first a military question. The new
							organization of the army began on the first of June last— From that time
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> command
							ceased— He has continued to issue orders to the troops in the same
							manner, as while he was in the military service— They have been obeyed;
							but <persRef ref="brooke-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Brooke</persRef>, the Officer in command at Pensacola, has written
							to enquire of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>,
							whether he is subject to the military command of General Jackson, and
							safe, in obeying his orders— Brown answers not only in the negative; but
							expresses surprize that such a question should ever have been made—
							Brown’s Letter however passed through the War Department, and has not
							yet been transmitted to Brook— The question was now discussed. The
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, thought Jackson had no command—
							Calhoun inclined to the same opinion, but said he knew that Jackson had
							acted upon full deliberation and advisement. I thought he had decided
							correctly—his Commission having given him the powers not only of
							Governor, but of the Captain General of Cuba, which was of course, the
							Military command in chief throughout the Province— I observed that the
							military was the only executive power in the Province—and that if the
							Governor had no military command, he had no effective authority; no
							means of executing his decrees; administrative or Judicial. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Wirt said he might employ the Militia.
							But there was no Militia in Florida— Wirt said Jackson had organized
							Counties and introduced Juries— Could he not by the same authority have
							constituted a Militia?— perhaps he might— But how were they to be armed;
							officered; trained; disciplined? at what enormous expence must they be
							made effective; and all for a mere interval between the taking of
							possession of the Province, and the next Session of Congress—and all to
							perform a service which could be executed by a file of fifty soldiers,
							who have nothing else to do. The President, mentioned that this question
							had occurred last Spring, and he had conversed with <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef> concerning it; Gaines
							had at first been named as the Officer to take possession of
							East-Florida— But it had not then been thought necessary to decide the
							question— Gaines had told him he would take care that no collision
							should arise upon it between Jackson and him— I asked, what necessity,
							there was for deciding it now. It was after all a mere question of form—
							If Jackson could not as Governor issue direct orders, as a Military
							commander, he could issue requisitions to the very same effect; and
							which the troops were just as much bound to obey. Calhoun said they were
							now actually obeyed; and would be so till counter-orders should be
							received from hence. The question might therefore be left undecided— It
							was therefore postponed— The next point considered was the controversy
							between General Jackson and <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">Judge
								Fromentin</persRef>— The opinion was unanimous that as the only Laws
							extended to the territory, were those of the revenue and against the
							Slave-trade; Fromentin’s jurisdiction was confined to them; and he had
							no right to issue the writ of Habeas Corpus, to liberate <persRef
								ref="callava-jose">Callava</persRef>. But the President, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt were of opinion that Fromentin having issued the writ though
							erroneously in his judicial capacity was not amenable for it to Jackson,
							and that Jackson had no right to summon him before him to answer for it.
							I thought he had. For it being admitted that Fromentin had no right to

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> the junior Editor of
							the National Intelligencer, came to the Office, to request an advance
							upon the printing of the Census, to which I agreed— Adjourned Cabinet
							Meeting at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— I
							received and took with me, a Letter from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Governor Jackson</persRef>, enclosing a proclamation, ordering
							several Spanish Officers who had remained there, to depart from the
							Province within four days. They had published in the Newspapers, a
							Declaration highly insulting to him, upon the affair of <persRef
								ref="callava-jose">Callava</persRef>— I told the President that upon
							further reflection I thought if he had made up his mind that General
							Jackson had no right to issue military orders to our troops stationed in
							the Province, both General Jackson and <persRef ref="brooke-george"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Brook</persRef> ought to be
							informed of it; because cases might arise in which the legality or
							illegality of his orders might be of infinite importance— It appeared
							that in Callava’s case, there had been threats on his part of resistance
							by force and of bloodshed—and that <persRef ref="butler-robert">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Butler’s</persRef> soldiers had
							primed and loaded their muskets in front of Callava’s house. Violence
							might in the state of things there be expected; and if it should occur
							upon illegal orders, issued after the Government have had time and
							opportunity to forbid them blame would fall upon the Administration for
							the omission to give notice to the parties implicated, of the
							President’s determination— The question as to the right was then
							discussed again— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> argued the point as he naturally and
							properly does all questions in the Cabinet, as a lawyer— He seemed to
							think, that General Jackson’s powers, being those heretofore exercised
							by the Provincial Governors, and by the Governor and Captain General of
							Cuba, could have operation, only upon the old inhabitants, and not upon
							Citizens of the United States. And he remarked that the object for which
							those powers were conferred upon Jackson was to maintain the old Spanish
							Inhabitants in the enjoyment of their Liberty, property and religion;
							provisionally and until they can be admitted to all the rights and
							privileges of Citizens of the United States— This was the stipulation of
							the Treaty; made for the benefit of the Spanish inhabitants— How then
							could Jackson exercise authority over Citizens of the United States? How
							could he have any command of the army; the creature of the Law; governed
							by the Articles of War, and having only the Officers and Commanders
							recognized by Law? All this appeared to me to be very sound reasoning;
							taking departure from the Constitution and Laws of the United States;
							with all our principles restrictive of power; and our cardinal maxim of
							separating the civil from the Military authority, and the Legislative,
							Executive and Judicial powers from each other— But nothing of all this
							is suited to the occasion— We have acquired a Spanish Province,
							heretofore governed by arbitrary principles and by military rule—
							Congress had not time at their last Session to introduce our checked and
							balanced system of Government there— They continued therefore until
							their next Session the antient system of Government; and all the powers
							formerly exercised by the Supreme Rulers of the Province were vested in
							the Governor. The military was their only executive— To deny the
							Governor the right to command the Soldiers, was to strip him of all
							effective power— If Citizens of the United States went into the
							Province, they must go and abide there conformably to the Law of the
							time and the place— They cannot carry the Constitution or the Laws of
							the United States there with them— To this, the authority of Congress is
							alone competent. The question whether Jackson can <hi rend="italic"
								>command</hi>, the troops is a question merely of forms. And where
							there is nothing but form at issue, I cannot perceive the use of
							attaching much importance to it— The more direct the power to command
							is, the more effective it will be to its purpose; nor do I perceive any
							inconvenience in direct command, more than would be incident to
							subsidiary <pb type="ms" n="116"/>requisition— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							expressed a doubt whether Jackson had the power to order the Spanish
							Officers out of the Province— Neither he nor Wirt seemed capable of
							realizing the exercise of absolute power by an American Governor—
							Calhoun said he was afraid the Officers would not go; in which case
							Jackson would certainly send them to Jail; in short he lived he said in
							continual fear of hearing from mail to mail of some Tragedy happening
							there. I said that undoubtedly the Spanish Governors had and exercised
							the power of ordering all Strangers out of the Province, or of
							committing them to prison for the mere act of being there— The question
							of Jackson’s authority to summon <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">Judge
								Fromentin</persRef> before him was yet more difficult— Calhoun and
							Wirt considered the issuing of the writ of Habeas Corpus as a judicial
							act; performed in his official capacity; for which he was not personally
							answerable— I thought that as it was agreed he had no right to issue it,
							he was at least so far answerable for it, as to be liable to a summons
							to declare the authority upon which he had issued it— Calhoun put the
							supposition that it was <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi>. I said that it
							made no difference— Fromentin had legally the right to issue the writ or
							he had not— If he had, he was not accountable to Jackson for issuing
							it—if he had not as was unanimously agreed, he was. It was a very
							dangerous interference with the Governor’s authority; and the
							doubtfulness of the question of his own right, could not impair or in
							any manner affect the Official powers of the Governor. Calhoun said he
							had no doubt that Jackson’s intentions were perfectly pure and upright—
							But his disposition was to exercise to its utmost extent, every particle
							of power given to him— He had not sufficient regard to the genius of our
							Institutions, and to the popular opinion— And he observed that almost
							all the newspapers had taken side against Jackson on this occasion— Even
							those which had supported him most strenuously in the affair of the
							Seminole War— I said with too much warmth that I could not and would not
							consider, the nature of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Institutions, the
							transient popular opinion, or the factious comments of Newspapers, as
							having any weight in the case— The enquiry was of Justice and of Power—
							Jackson’s Commission gave him all the powers of a Spanish Governor; he
							had exercised them only for the purposes of Justice— It seemed to me
							absurd after formally investing him with absolute power, utterly
							incompatible with all our Institutions and habits and opinions, to blame
							him for using it to the only ends which could justify the use of them
							at-all. Wirt thought that Jackson ought to have had regard to the
							popular opinion, because the credit and influence of the administration
							is affected by it; and the censure upon him for using the power, would
							be shared by them for conferring it upon him. The President said that
							Congress had extended to Florida, only the Laws relating to the revenue
							and to the Slave-trade— In all other respects the system of Spanish
							Government were continued till the next Session. Here then were two
							systems, different and opposite in their characters, in operation at
							once in the same territory— For the American Law, Fromentin was the
							judge, and in the exercise of his Jurisdiction was independent of
							Jackson— For the Spanish Law, Jackson was the judge; and independent of
							the authority of Fromentin— He thought therefore that judge Fromentin
							had no right to issue the writ of Habeas-Corpus, and that Jackson had no
							right to Summon Fromentin before him. Each jurisdiction was independent
							of the other. It was suggested by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							that as the Government of Florida, was by the act of Congress to be
							administered by such persons and in such <hi rend="italic">manner</hi>,
							as the President should direct, Instructions might be sent to Governor
							Jackson to exercise no authority but such as would be compatible with
							our Institutions: and the President said he wished there might be as
							little exercise of <pb type="ms" n="117"/>authority as possible. I said
							I thought such an order would be very dangerous, and equivalent to the
							suspension of all Government in the province. While the discussion
							continued four O’Clock came, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							finding himself somewhat unwell, the Meeting was again adjourned till
							to-morrow Noon. I received a despatch from <persRef

						<p><date>25. V:15.</date> Third successive day’s Cabinet Meeting. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Wirt</persRef> present— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							again raised the question whether <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> had the right to banish the Spanish Officers, and
							inclined to the opinion that if their remaining in the Country after the
							expiration of the stipulated six Months was a violation of the Treaty,
							Jackson had only power to give them notice to depart, and if they
							refused, to make report of their refusal to this Government. But the
							principal debate of this day, was upon the transactions with <persRef
								ref="callava-jose">Callava</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt insisted that as the Commissioner of Spain, Callava was entitled to
							the immunities of a public minister; at least to exemption from the
							process of our judicial tribunals. I admitted that as Commissioner, he
							was priviledged to the extent necessary for the performance of his
							duties; but I thought his privilege ceased when those duties were
							performed, and a reasonable time had been allowed him to depart— They
							ceased at all Events at the expiration of the six Months within which
							Spain had stipulated in the Treaty that the Province should be evacuated
							by her Officers and troops— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt made
							questions whether by the stipulation that the Officers and troops should
							be withdrawn, they were obliged to depart from the territory or merely
							to evacuate the forts— Also whether Governor Callava could be included
							under the denomination of an Officer and even if as Governor he could,
							whether his other character of Commissioner, did not give him new
							privileges, and a right to remain, even after the evacuation by the
							Officers and troops. These questions were embarrassing, but they
							appeared to me to be trifling niceties. That whether the Governor of the
							Province was an Officer, seemed such cavilling, as well as that whether
							withdrawing implied evacuation of the territory, that I answered them
							impatiently, and rather slightingly, which I regret, because M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt was hurt by the tone I assumed:
							unruffleable patience and composure is essential to all sound
							deliberation; and I have not yet attained it in perfection— Wirt said he
							had supposed that the very object of deliberation was to consider the
							subject in every light of which it was susceptible, and to anticipate
							every objection that could be made; to which I fully assented— The
							inclination of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>
							opinion appeared to be against Jackson’s proceedings upon all the
							points; though he has invariably been clear that Fromentin had no right
							to issue the writ of Habeas Corpus— But he has no doubt of the purity of
							his motives and intentions, and he is also convinced of the integrity of
								<persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef>. I finally
							suggested that it would be proper before coming to a decisive opinion
							upon the affair with Callava, to communicate to Jackson himself the
							complaint of <persRef ref="salmon-hilario">Salmon</persRef>, the
							Spanish charge d’Affaires against him, with Callava’s protest, and to
							wait and learn what he has to say in answer to them himself— In the
							meantime, that I should write both to him and to judge Fromentin,
							informing them of the President’s views with regard to the questions of
							conflicting jurisdiction between them; and that the War Department
							should signify to him the President’s opinion that he has no direct
							command of the troops— To all this the President agreed, and I took with
							me a sketch of the substance of an answer to the complaint of the
								<persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Spanish Minister</persRef>, which
							the President had himself drawn up— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							in support of his opinion of Callava’s immunities as a Commissioner,
							cited and read two passages of <persRef ref="vattel-emer"

								>r</hi> Anduaga— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> was with the
							President; but just sufficiently recovered to attend to business. He was
							consulting the President about the appointment of keepers for two new
							lighthouses in the State of Maine— After he went away I mentioned to the
							President my objections to the amendments he had proposed to my drafts
							of Letters to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Governor Jackson</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">judge Fromentin</persRef>— These
							amendments in direct terms told each of those Officers that he had no
							right to do, what he had done— I observed that this might perhaps
							dissatisfy both of them— It might possibly induce both of them to
							resign, and then to make it a matter of controversy with the
							Administration. Fromentin might be appeasable; but Jackson had a strong
							hold on the affections of this people— There was now a clamour almost
							entirely factious, against Jackson, because it was expected the
							Administration would support him; but if he should be harshly treated,
							and resign in disgust, there would be a reaction of popular opinion in
							his favour, and even those now the loudest in the clamour against him
							would turn in his favour against the Government. I had therefore in the
							drafts of the Letters stated the President’s opinion with regard to the
							right in terms clear and intelligible, but rather by inference than by
							express statement; and as to General Jackson I had understood from the
							President’s Note of 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> that it was his
							intention to write, himself to the General. He said upon further
							reflection he had thought best that whatever should be written to
							General Jackson upon the subject, should be official, and through the
							regular Departments; and it had occurred to him that in expressing his
							opinion, of the errors of Jackson and Fromentin, he should frankly
							acknowledge to them, that his own omission to give them more special
							instructions was probably the cause of the difficulties which had arisen
							in their construction, of their respective Commissions— I told him that
								<pb type="ms" n="120"/>all apology from a superior to a subordinate
							authority was incongruous, and if he thought it due to those Officers to
							take a part of the responsibility for their errors upon himself, it
							would be better to introduce it into the communication to Congress than
							to make a direct acknowledgment of it, to the Officers themselves; with
							which he immediately concurred— I left the Drafts again with the
							President for further examination— I mentioned to him that I had
							observed in the newspapers, that the case of the Jeune Eugenie had been
							tried by the Circuit Court at Boston; but the judgment of the Court upon
							it was postponed— I supposed that the judgment of the Court would
							furnish a suitable answer to be given to the demands of the French
							Minister— But the case of the Apollon remains to be tried in the Circuit
							Court in Georgia. <persRef ref="edon-unknown">Captain Edon</persRef> has
							sued the <persRef ref="clark-archibald">Collector at S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">District Attorney in Georgia</persRef>,
							appearing ex Officio for the Collector has written to enquire upon what
							grounds the legality of the seizure has been maintained diplomatically—
							I had taken to the President, the Letter of <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> to me, of 2. July, and referred him to his note
							to <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef>, of 28 June—
							I asked him if these papers were to be communicated with the rest to the
							District Attorney—and I told him they were to me unaccountable papers—
							In the Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pasquier, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin has taken a new ground of
							defence, the main objection to which was, that the fact was directly
							against it; as the evidence which we ourselves shall be obliged to
							produce would prove— But in his Letter to me he pronounces dogmatically
							against all our grounds, and at the same time totally demolishes his
							own— The President desired me to send the Letter and Note round to the
							other members of the administration, and said he would consult them upon
							what was to be done— He wished particularly to consult, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, to whom especially the original
							responsibility of the measure belonged. The Treasury order had issued in
							May 1818 when he himself was absent from the City: at least he thought
							so: not that he wished to evade the responsibility, of having afterwards
							approved it. But whatever was to be done, should be with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawfords approbation or knowledge— On
							leaving the President’s I met in the large entry <persRef
								ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>
							who has just returned to the City recovered from a severe bilious fever.
							On returning to the Office I found a Note from <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg,</persRef> with a printed
							copy of a Treaty between Sweden &amp; Russia, concluded in March last,
							and relating to the boundaries between the two Countries— We took an
							after dinner walk—and had evening visits from <persRef
								ref="munroe-thomas2">T. Munroe jun<hi rend="superscript"

							his cousin <persRef ref="whetcroft-juliana">Juliana Whetcroft</persRef>,
							the most beautiful girl in Washington, was to be married next Tuesday to
							a <persRef ref="marshall-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Marshall</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="marshall-humphrey"
								>Humphrey Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky. Watkins, brought me a
							number of written queries, upon subjects of Insurance— He also gave me
							his opinion of <persRef ref="king-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William King</persRef> the Commissioner, who he said had
							lost some credit here. He had particularly annoyed his Colleague
								<persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef>, by his
							repeated and earnest denials that he had any personal interest in the
							claims upon which they are to decide. Watkins said King had been
							exceedingly solicitous about the issue of the election of his Successor
							as Governor of Maine.</p>
