						<dateline><hi rend="italic">Thursday 1. November 1821.</hi></dateline>
						<p><date>1. V:30.</date> There was a heavy gale of wind in the Night, and
							about one O’Clock this morning we were awaked and alarmed by the fall of
							a part of the top of one of our Chimneys, which was blown down. The
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville,</persRef> the French Minister came to the Office, and
							mentioned to me; that at the late trial of La Jeune Eugénie at Boston,
							the French Consul had presented a protest against the Jurisdiction of
							the Court; which the Court had declined receiving; and the Consul had
							written to him for Instructions. He wished <pb type="ms" n="122"/>to
							agree with me upon the manner, of effecting this interposition on the
							part of the French Government and came therefore to ask of me an answer
							to his Letter of 24 August last in which he demanded that the vessel
							should be delivered up— I told him that the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> had been constantly inclined from the time when
							he first made the demand that the vessel should be delivered up; but
							that the capture had been made on the presumption that she was an
							American vessel, and the case was regularly before the judicial
							tribunal; from which the President had no power to take it. The
							Government was therefore under some embarrassment how to proceed in the
							case, but I presumed the vessel would ultimately be delivered up; as we
							utterly disclaimed the right of searching French vessels in time of
							Peace; and were resisting to the utmost the effort of Great-Britain to
							obtain such a right by Treaty— With regard to the mode of interposition,
							and also to the principle of delivering up a foreign vessel even after
							judicial cognizance has been taken of her case, the Baron mentioned a
							case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, and reported in
							the 7<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>volume of Cranch’s Reports—the case
							of the Balaou, or Schooner Exchange. And he said he had in manuscript
							the decisions of <persRef ref="peters-richard">Judge Peters</persRef>,
							in the District, and of <persRef ref="washington-bushrod">judge
								Washington</persRef> in the Circuit Court— He referred also to a
							correspondence in 1801. between <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord
								Hawkesbury</persRef> then British Secretary of State for foreign
							Affairs, and the Danish Minister <persRef ref="wedeljarlsberg-frederik"
								>Count Wedel-Jarlsberg</persRef>, for a precedent of vessels
							delivered up, by an executive order, after an answer in the first
							instance that they must abide the result of a judicial trial— These
							papers are in the Supplement Vol. 2. p. 442. of <persRef
								ref="martens-georg">Martens’s</persRef> collection of Treaties— I
							asked the Baron to furnish me these Precedents, and he afterwards sent
							them to me by the <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de
							Menou</persRef>—together with a late correspondence between the British
							and French Governments in which the former not only delivered up a
							French Slave-trader captured by a British Cruizer from Sierra-Leone, but
							apologized by anticipation for the capture, without waiting for a
							complaint. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> called at my Office, and spoke of Affairs in
							Florida— He said he felt himself much relieved by the Address of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to the
							Inhabitants of Florida, published at the time of his departure from
							Pensacola. It was extremely well written, and remarkable for dignity and
							moderation— This would much diminish the unpopularity of his late
							measures; and if he should resign, as he had intimated his intention of
							doing it would go still further in assuaging the public temper. I shewed
							him the drafts I had made of Letters to Jackson and Fromentin, and read
							to him that to the Spanish Minister in answer to <persRef
								ref="salmon-hilario">Salmon</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun still thinks that <persRef ref="callava-jose"
								>Callava</persRef> was entitled to exemption from arrest of his
							person or seizure of his papers, by his character of Commissioner. His
							argument is that as Commissioner it was his duty to deliver the papers—
							It was his duty to make the Selection of the papers, from all those that
							were in his possession— He was to judge and decide, which were to be
							delivered up, and which to be detained— If he had been unfaithful in the
							discharge of this duty, we had a right to complain— To demand the
							delivery of the papers wrongfully detained by him— To call upon his
							Sovereign to punish him; but not to use force to obtain the papers;
							still less to imprison his person— It was in his character as
							Commissioner that he withheld the papers— To use force to obtain them
							was therefore violence upon his official character, bearing precisely
							upon the point in which and for which he was priviledged. This argument
							presents the claim of immunity in its strongest light; but I still think
							that the Commissarial character and its privileges had doubly
							terminated—first by the surrender of the province, and secondly by the
							limitation in the Treaty— And I said if it had not, I should be disposed
							to say of it, what <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> says of the
							Execution of <persRef ref="desa-pantaleon">don Pantaleon de
							Sa</persRef>, the brother of <persRef ref="desa-joao">the Portuguese
								ambassador</persRef>, by <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver">Oliver
								Cromwell</persRef>, for a murder—that although the laws of Nations
							were violated it was by a signal act of Justice; deserving universal
							approbation— Calhoun said he had much rather the affair should not have
							happened, for it would be used as an engine of faction against the
							Administration— There was a party very busy in decrying the
							administration as anti-repub<pb type="ms" n="123"/>lican and regardless
							of the Constitution— Every incident of this kind would give them
							opportunity to rouse clamour, of which they would not fail to take
							advantage. This I admitted, but observed that I placed great reliance
							upon the ultimate rectitude of public opinion— In this case the utmost
							extent of the injury done was the imprisonment of Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Callava, one day— The benefit secured was
							the saving of a family of orphans from ruin— It was impossible that the
							people of this Country should permanently censure this attainment of the
							substantial ends of justice, from a respect for forms venerable indeed
							as instruments to the same ends, but which lose their nature when
							perverted to evil purposes— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina"
								type="multi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> dined with us, but I
							was obliged to leave them at 5. O’Clock, and meet at my Office <persRef
								ref="caldwell-elias">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Caldwell</persRef> and <persRef ref="law-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Law</persRef>— I read the answers of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, which they had taken, and they were
							occupied till nine in the Evening, taking mine; but without getting
							through— They adjourned, to take M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun’s answers to-morrow, and on Saturday are to call again upon me—
							They are desired, if possible, to take all the three depositions this
							week. When I returned home, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

						<p><date>2. VI:</date> At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>Presidents</persRef>. Met <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> there. He was
							asking for the papers which were at the Department of State, in the case
							of a British vessel which entered at St Augustine, after possession
							taken by the United States— She had incurred two forfeitures— One for
							bringing in Slaves; and the other for a breach of the Navigation Act.
							The Secretary of the Treasury could remit the latter; but the President
							only could remit the former, and had directed the remission to be made
							out— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford spoke also of the
							application of <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> in behalf of Norwegian vessels to be exempted
							from the operation of the Navigation Act, in reciprocation of the
							Norwegian revocation of all discriminating duties. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had written to the Department of
							State to enquire if Official notice had been received of the Norwegian
							Ordinance— I afterwards sent him the despatch from <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes</persRef> with the enclosed copy
							of the notification from <persRef ref="engstrom-lars">Count
								d’Engeström</persRef>. Crawford said that the Proclamation which had
							issued last Summer in return for this Norwegian Ordinance was of no
							effect; because it granted nothing which was not already secured to the
							Norwegians by the Treaty with Sweden— I had a doubt whether the Treaty
							with Sweden extended to Norway— The Norwegian Ordinance however is not
							founded upon the Treaty; and as the Act of Congress prescribes that the
							Proclamation shall issue in such cases, it was properly issued, although
							it granted immediately nothing but what was already enjoyed by the
							Treaty— For the Treaty is limited to eight years, and the Law may be
							continued much longer. Crawford mentioned also Stackelberg’s claim, that
							the vessels of the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Bartholomews should be allowed to bring to the United States West-India
							produce generally, which we both thought unfounded— I mentioned to the
							President the application of the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean"
								>French Minister</persRef> yesterday upon the case of La jeune
							Eugénie; and the Letter I had received the day before concerning it from
								<persRef ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef> the district
							Attorney, who is very confident that the vessel will be condemned. Blake
							had argued to the Court, that even if she was a French vessel the Court
							ought not to sustain the claim of a French claimant, if it appeared that
							she was engaged in a trade prohibited by the Laws of France— The Baron
							was alarmed at this doctrine as coming from the public Officer of the
							United States, though I told him it was merely by way of argument as
							Counsel, and the Court would not so decide. I left the papers with the
							President, who directed that a meeting of the members of the
							Administration should be called to consider of the case at Noon
							to-morrow— We spent the Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Thornton’s</persRef> in company with a
								<persRef ref="burton-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burton</persRef> an Englishman, Poet, Musician, and Painter; who
							played on the Mandoline, and sung songs, among which one of his own
							composition about the “Emigrant Bard.” He also shewed us a number of his
							own <pb type="ms" n="124"/>drawings, very well executed. <persRef
								ref="daspremont-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								d’Aspremont</persRef> came in as an evening visitor. <persRef

						<p><date>3. VI:30.</date> Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, at Noon. All the members of the
							Administration were present <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy having returned with his family to the City, yesterday.
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> was reporting the case of a man named
								<persRef ref="forward-oliver">Forward</persRef>, Collector at
							Buffalo, against whom there are complaints and who is to be removed— The
							case of La Jeune Eugénie was discussed with much diversity of opinion as
							to the measures to be pursued— The President inclining to order the
							delivery of the vessel to the <persRef ref="devalnais-joseph">French
								Consul</persRef>, by direct authority, with which opinion M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford concurred. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson strongly inclined against any
							executive interference, but was for leaving the cause to the decision of
							the Court. If they should decide against their own jurisdiction, the
							vessel would of course be restored— If they should sustain it that would
							furnish an answer to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister</persRef> with which he and his Government ought to be
							satisfied. <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> also had great scruples about the propriety of
							executive interference with judiciary proceedings, and it was observed
							that the precedent of the Schooner Exchange, in <persRef
								ref="cranch-william">Cranch’s</persRef> Reports did not apply, that
							vessel having been claimed by the French Minister as a public vessel— It
							was contended that here, the question was of the national character of
							the vessel; and whether that was to be considered established beyond all
							enquiry, merely by the flag or the papers. If the mere exhibition of the
							flag precluded all examination, it was in vain to enact Laws against the
							Slave-trade; for it were preposterous to suppose that the Slave-trading
							vessels would shew the flag of a Nation, with a cruizer under the same
							flag in sight; when the mere hoisting of another flag would shield her
							from all examination— After long debate of these questions I suggested
							that the precedent in the case of the Exchange should be followed, in
							regard to the communication with the Circuit Court— That the <persRef
								ref="blake-george">district Attorney</persRef> should be instructed
							to make a suggestion, to the Court, that the French Minister, had
							demanded the delivery of the vessel, as a French vessel, amenable only
							to the jurisdiction of French tribunals, and that the President
							considered the claim to be well founded; the Court would act upon this
							suggestion as they should think proper— If they should decide to deliver
							up the vessel, the claim of the French Minister would be admitted, and
							the question at an end. If they should maintain their own Jurisdiction,
							and condemn the vessel, they would assign reasons for their decision
							which would be subject to reversal on revisal by the Supreme Court of
							the United States, and furnish the answer to be given to the claim on
							the part of France. After much desultory Conversation, it seemed to be
							agreed that this course should be taken; but as M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson was still dissatisfied with it, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt still expressed doubts, I proposed to
							the President to take a formal opinion of the Attorney General, after he
							shall have read all the papers sent to me by the French Minister as
							Precedents—to which the President assented— There was also something
							said of a vessel called the San Jose now fitting out as a piratical
							privateer at Baltimore— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> had some time since
							given notice of this vessel; and there has since been a complaint from
							the <persRef ref="benabeo-juan">Spanish Consul</persRef> to the <persRef
								ref="mcculloch-james">Collector</persRef>— Several expedients were
							suggested, by the President and by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford— To order the revenue Cutter to accompany her out to Sea; to
							put a file of Soldiers on board, with orders not to leave her, until she
							shall be 70 miles out from the Coast—to station officers of the Customs
							on board of her &amp;c. But there appeared to be nothing positively
							determined— She entered at Baltimore, as a Colombian, Merchant vessel,
							in ballast— She has been ostensibly loading a Cargo of flour, but Cannon
							have been purchased for her and Seamen enlisted at high wages, with
							great notoriety— Their practice is to clear out from Baltimore as
							Merchant vessels, and to take in their guns and Seamen, down in
							Chesapeake Bay— After the meeting was over a young man by the name of
								<persRef ref="merrick-unknown">Merrick</persRef> called on me, at
							the Office— He is a nephew of <persRef ref="vaughan-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Vaughan</persRef> of Philadelphia
							from whom he brought a Letter of introduction to <persRef
								ref="young-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young</persRef>— He
							is concerned in a manufactory of fire Engines, according to the Patent
							invention of <persRef ref="perkins-jacob">Jacob Perkins</persRef>— We
							had evening visits from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Gov<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cass</persRef> of the Michigan
							Territory, and from <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Lee</persRef>; but I was obliged to leave them
							and attend in my Library Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi><persRef
								ref="caldwell-elias">Caldwell</persRef> and <persRef ref="law-john"
								>Law</persRef>, who came to take a continuation of my deposition.
								<pb type="ms" n="125"/>They had already this Evening, taken that of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> at his house. They came between seven and eight in
							the Evening, and were with me till near eleven, without being able to
							get through. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell therefore wrote a
							line to Philadelphia to say that the Commission could not be closed till
							next week, and we adjourned to meet again on Monday, at my house. I told
							them I should wish to keep copies as well of my own Answers, as of those
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun, and desired them to leave the papers with me, that
							I might have copies of them made out. They left them accordingly, except
							the answers of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, which being much
							interlined and almost illegible, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Law said
							he wished to write over again— I told them I should wish one of my own
							answers also to be written over again and much enlarged, having by a
							close examination of my Diary of February and March 1818. found many
							particulars minuted at the time, serving to confirm my former testimony,
							and which I wished fully to disclose— To which they agreed.</p>

						<p><date>4. V:45.</date> Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>, preach from Psalm
							126.5. “They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.” It was an occasional
							discourse upon the recent decease of his own Son, who died in Virginia,
							after an illness of a very few days, of the fever which is spreading
							calamity through this part of the Country. There was no direct allusion
							to this Event in the Sermon, but the tone of Sentiment, and the
							principles inculcated in it were entirely suitable to the
							occasion—Resignation, Faith, Hope, and Trust in God were the topics and
							they were aptly handled— Many of the deaths of which we hear from day to
							day; are affecting, by the incidents attending them, or by the
							circumstances of the sufferers. Among the rest we heard yesterday of the
							death of <persRef ref="stewart-marion">Marion Stewart</persRef>, one of
							the most beautiful young women who have adorned the social circle of our
							late Winter’s. After returning home from Church, I employed the
							remainder of the day and the Evening in writing my answers for the
							Interrogatories; and the extracts from my Diary. They confirm my former
							testimony even beyond my expectations. <persRef ref="hellen-johnson"
								>Johnson Hellen</persRef> made me a copy of the Commission and
							interrogatories, and <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> answers— I find great advantage in
							having kept copies of my answers under the former Commission— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford’s character is fully developed
							in <persRef ref="clarke-john2">Governor Clark’s</persRef> pamphlet, and
							after reflecting upon the lineaments of that portrait, I cannot be
							surprized at any thing bearing the mark of congenial features— A
							worthless and desperate man, against whom I have been compelled to
							testify in a Court of Justice, attempts in the face of his own
							conscience to save himself from infamy by discrediting my testimony, and
							finds in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford a ready and willing
							auxiliary. To support him in this scandalous purpose, Crawford solemnly
							deposes in a Court of Justice to that which is not true— I cannot yet
							bring myself to believe that it has been by wilful falsehood— Ambition
							debauches Memory itself— Crawford has positively sworn to things as
							requested by me, which by his own shewing he knew only by hearsay from
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— I never did request
							them. He has sworn to things as having been told him of my saying in
							February 1818. bottomed upon facts which I did not know till the
							following March— In the fairest possible view that can be taken of his
							deposition, he began by a gross and total misconception, and has ended
							by a misrepresentation equally gross and total of the whole subject— He
							has blended and confounded times and circumstances, and represented as a
							formal statement of my evidence given before him and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, of what I considered as a mere
							casual answer to a question from him, and at a time when I have all but
							absolute certainty that Calhoun was not even present— He has sworn so
							positively that I began even to mistrust my own Memory, and to fear
							there had been some strange misunderstanding of my own, till by
							recurrence to my Diary, I find my own recollections confirmed by the
							minutes which I made at the time— May the law of truth be ever upon my
							lips, and that of honour ever in my heart.</p>

							hours after they came to my house, and took my signatures to my Answers—
							Then they went to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef> to close the Commission. There was
							one interrogatory put on the part of <persRef ref="harris-levett"

								ref="gales-joseph">Joseph Gales</persRef>, (to whom there were also

							testify to their own memories. This question <persRef

								Crawford</persRef> did not at first answer; and when I observed it
							to the Commissioners, they told me it was not answered— I understood

							his memory was tenacious of results, but not of details— This evening
							when the Commissioners came to take my signatures I found that Crawford
							had this day answered this last interrogatory, swearing stoutly to the

							in the statement he made of my request to be heard before him and
							Calhoun, to the fact that I did make <hi rend="strikethrough">it</hi>
							that which he had understood the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> to say I had to make, and that he told Harris
							of it immediately afterwards— And for confirmation of what he had stated
							me to have said afterwards in the Winter of 1819—that he had also told
							Harris of that immediately afterwards— I desired a copy of this last
							answer of Crawford, which Law immediately made; but it did not occur to
							me to add to my own deposition which already stated that I had read the
							answers of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, that it was with the
							exception of this last one, or to make any remarks upon it— In truth the
							remarks that I should make upon it, are better suppressed, if as I
							believe, they are not absolutely necessary to confirm my own testimony—
							I have proved it impossible that I should have made the request at the
							time when he says the President told him I had; and I have shewn to
							demonstration the truth of the assertion in my former deposition, which
							Harris has been attempting to disprove— But the most remarkable fact
							elicited by this last interrogatory is the admission by Crawford, that
							he told Harris, immediately after they occurred things said by me, in
							confidential Consultations of the Executive Administration— And on one
							occasion, when this was on my part only a consultation between me and
							the President, to which he was knowing only by accidentally coming in
							while I was consulting the President, and being asked by the President,
							as an Executive Officer his opinion upon it— That he should immediately
							go and tell this to Harris, is an unequivocal trait of character— That
							in these private communications to Harris, he should have misrepresented
							the facts owing to misconceptions of his own is not at all surprizing;
							moral principle and sound Understanding are generally very closely
							allied. He certainly did misrepresent the facts to Harris, and thereby
							has reduced himself to the necessity of making this acknowledgment,
							which it is evident he did very reluctantly— In his first answers he
							only stated that he had told Harris what I had said in March 1818. and
							assigned as his motive, that it was to convince Harris that I was not
							his enemy— He then waived answering the question about his memory, and
							said nothing of his having divulged to Harris what I had said at the
							consultation with the President in January 1820. This he brings out
							after having read Calhoun’s answers and mine which discredit every
							material part of his testimony— For Calhoun’s answers are as
							contradictory to Crawford’s upon the facts which passed between them, as
							mine are to that part which concerns me.— Crawfords deposition is
							throughout marked by a prevaricating spirit of embarrassment, bred by
							his confidences to Harris, under his own misconceptions <pb type="ms"
								n="127"/>Calhoun had already spoken to me of this interrogatory
							about the memory, and said he was confident it had been suggested to
							Harris, by Crawford’s telling him of a Conversation between Calhoun and
							himself. Immediately after Harris commenced this action against <persRef
								ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>, he went to Calhoun, to enquire
							of him, what he would testify, as to the examination by Crawford and
							Calhoun in March 1818. Calhoun expecting to be called to testify,
							declined having any private conversation with Harris on the subject—
							Last Summer when Harris came here with the avowed purpose of falsifying
							my testimony; he applied again to Calhoun to sound him, and found that
							his recollections did not agree with those of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford— Crawford about the same time called on Calhoun,
							and they had some discussion, as to the substance of the Report they had
							made to the President in Harris’s case— In this discussion Calhoun said
							to Crawford, “your memory may be better than mine, as to the details;
							but I am entirely confident of my own, as to the results, and general
							impressions”— Now Calhoun concludes that Crawford must have told Harris
							this conversation, and even, his remark about their respective memories,
							as I have no doubt he did— I had this day some conversation with
								<persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>, in consequence of a Letter received by him from
								<persRef ref="wingate-joshua">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Wingate</persRef>— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> called at the
							Office, with a Letter from the <persRef ref="barclay-anthony">British
								Commissioner</persRef>, under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent— He said the Commissioners had not
							been able to agree upon their decision; which he was very sorry to
							learn— But the object of this Letter, was to apply for 72 sheets of
							mapping paper; wanted by the engineer of the British party to make two
							maps of the country surveyed; to accompany the Report of the British
							Commissioner to the two Governments— There must be one map for each. The
							paper is made only in France, and there is none to be procured in this
							Country, except what is in the possession of the War Department. I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, that I would make enquiry of
							the Secretary of War, and had no doubt the paper would be furnished, if
							we had it— I regretted with him, the disagreement of the Commissioners,
							and said I hoped we should find some easier and more expeditious way of
							settling the boundary than by a reference to a third power, though that
							was the mode stipulated by the Treaty. We have already found some
							inconvenience in the reference to a third party of another question; a
							perfectly simple one; being only of the construction of a single
							sentence: but this a question of disputed boundary upon which the
							Commissioners after five years of investigation surveys, and arguments
							had not been able to agree, a foreign sovereign, I thought would never
							be able to comprehend; much less satisfactorily to decide— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning spoke also of his application for
							the delivery of the Newfoundland Pirates. I said I had the more readily
							delayed answering him, from the hint I had given him from the beginning
							that we could not comply with the request. He again referred to the
							opinions of writers on the Laws of Nations, that atrocious criminals
							ought to be given up— I said the practice was different, by different
							Nations. Some did, and some did not deliver up. With us it was a
							question of authority— The President had not the power to deliver a man
							up— Canning mentioned that he had read with much satisfaction the
							argument of <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice
								Marshall</persRef> when he was a member of the house of
							Representatives, in the case of <persRef ref="nash-thomas">Nash or

							He said they had— That he had read part of my Answers, and saw the

								Crawford</persRef> whom he had told that he had expressly declined
							holding any conversation with <persRef ref="harris-levett"
								>Harris</persRef> about that to which he was to testify, should by
							telling Harris of what Calhoun had said to himself in private
							conversation make Calhoun thus to converse with Harris indirectly. He
							agreed with me in thinking that Crawford’s conduct now is forced upon
							him by his having committed himself with <unclear>Harris</unclear>, by
							telling him according to his own misconceptions, what had passed in the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> cabinet before— He
							said that he had been himself obliged to have an explanation with
							Crawford upon another affair— A question had arisen upon whose
							recommendation <persRef ref="flournoy-thomas">General Flournoy</persRef>
							had been appointed a Commissioner to treat with the Creek Indians—
							Crawford had written to some one in Georgia that it was upon Calhoun’s
							Recommendation; when in fact it had been upon his own. Crawford had
							finally written a Letter making some explanatory comment upon it, but so
							was the fact. I called then at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s
							Office, and had a conversation with him on the case of La jeune Eugenie.
							I found him still strongly averse to giving up the vessel— He said it
							did not appear to him to invoke at all the right of search— It was a
							question of fact, whether the vessel was French or American, and whether
							the mere hoisting of a foreign flag, or shew of foreign papers precluded
							all enquiry. If it did the act of Congress was of no avail, and all
							Legislation against the Slave-trade would be vanity. In this case the
							vessel was American built, and had been American property. She had an
							act of Francization, or French Custom House paper issued at Guadeloupe
							in 1819. But these papers were merely formal; issued of course on
							payment of a small sum of money. They were no indications of property—
							Now the property having been originally American why should not the
							French claimant be required to produce the usual evidence of transfer, a
							bill of sale— It was notorious that the Slave trade was now carried on
							by many of our Citizens under cover of Spanish and French names and
							papers; and if we should so readily give up this vessel, would it not
							have to the world the appearance of our conniving with France in these
							impostures? I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, that it seemed
							to me that this question was whether in time of Peace the Commander of a
							public vessel of one Nation, has a right to <hi rend="italic">board</hi>
							the merchant vessels of another. The decision of <persRef
								ref="scott-william">Sir William Scott</persRef>, in the case of Le
							Louis, resolves itself into the denial of that right. I thought the
							right could not be maintained. By the Law of Nature no vessel has a
							right to board another at Sea without its consent— Our public vessels
							have no right to board our own merchant vessels, except as expressly
							authorized by Acts of Congress. But Congress cannot authorize them to
							board foreign vessels, even to ascertain whether they are American or
							not— Because the act in general cases cannot be performed without
							inconvenience to the party boarded. The right of one vessel to board
							another in time of War, arises from the State of War, it is established
							by the usage of Nations and is restricted to particular purposes. In
							time of peace there is no such usage—if there is it must be found in the
							books of the Law of Nations— I know of none such— With regard to the
							Slave-trade there can be none such, because all the Acts prohibiting it,
							as well our own as those of other Nations are new— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said he thought it would be a very
							dangerous principle to assume, that the mere exhibition of a flag should
							shield a vessel from all examination. <pb type="ms" n="129"/>He said he
							would write to Baltimore for the volume of <persRef ref="dodson-john"
								>Dodson’s</persRef> Reports containing the decision of Sir William

						<p><date>8. V:</date> During the time while the Depositions were taking
							under the Commission from the Pennsylvania Court, I was obliged to
							suspend writing in my Diary— I resumed this occupation the morning after
							the Commission was closed, and find it necessary to devote more time
							than I have done to redeem its arrears. <persRef ref="edwards-alfred"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alfred P. Edwards</persRef> came
							this morning to the Office, and solicited the appointment of Consular
							agent at Buenos-Ayres. There was a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> at Noon; when the case of
							La Jeune Eugénie was again reconsidered— <persRef ref="wirt-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> repeated his
							objections to the delivery of the vessel; and I again stated my opinion
							that the flag must be considered as the protection of the vessel from
							being even boarded in time of peace. <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> warmly contested
							this, and asked how Pirates could ever be taken with such a principle—
							It was admitted that Pirates, and even vessels suspected of Piracy might
							be boarded, whatever flag they assumed and by the public armed vessels
							of every Nation; but it was by a belligerent right, Pirates being at
							War, with all mankind. It was also customary for nations to authorize
							the boarding of vessels hovering upon their Coasts, though at some
							distance beyond their territorial jurisdiction. Great-Britain authorizes
							this boarding at two leagues distant from the Shore; and our Collection
							Law gives the same authority to our revenue Cutters, at four leagues
							distance from our Shore. Thus against piracy, and for the execution of
							revenue Laws, and the suppression of smuggling, a limited right of
							boarding is authorised by the usage of Nations— In these cases the flag
							is no protection, because the right is exercised avowedly over the
							vessels of all Nations— But there is neither right nor usage to board
							the vessel of a foreign Nation to enquire whether she is engaged in the
							Slave trade; or even whether her flag has been assumed or not— The
							utmost that can be said therefore is that if the Commander of one of our
								<pb type="ms" n="130"/>public armed vessels boards a vessel under a
							foreign flag, it is at his own and his Nation’s peril— If she proves to
							be American, he may seize and bring her in with impunity— But should she
							prove to be really foreign, he is not only responsible for all damages
							to the party boarded; but his Government is bound to make reparation to
							the Government of the other, for the injury to its flag— The very
							expressions in common use appear to indicate the general impression of
							mankind that the protection of a vessel against molestation from others
							is her flag. And I cannot understand the decision of <persRef
								ref="scott-william">Sir William Scott</persRef>, in the case of Le
							Louis, in any other light than as denying the right of boarding— As to
							the authority to deliver up, it must in this case be consequent upon the
							decision of the Court consequent upon the suggestion to be made by the
								<persRef ref="blake-george">District Attorney</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt, questioned whether the French Minister sufficiently
							asserted the vessel to be French, and thought it quite probable that if
							tried in France, the defence for her would be that she was an American
							vessel— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said that admitting there
							was no usage of Nations, to authorize boarding for suppression of the
							Slave-trade; there was such an usage for other purposes; and that usage
							must at some time have commenced—it was then founded in reason— The
							prohibitions of the Slave-trade, are all recent. The right of boarding
							vessels to carry them into effect, cannot therefore be antient; but the
								<hi rend="italic">reason</hi> upon which the old usage first arose,
							and upon which alone it must have rested when it was new, applies
							equally to the Laws against the Slave-trade now— It was merely a new
							application of an old principle. But I insisted that even if the reason
							were the same, a new application of it so seriously affecting the right,
							convenience and even safety of navigators could not be made but by
							common consent. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							continued decidedly of opinion that the vessel ought to be given up. But
							Crawford observed that the papers decisively proved the insincerity of
							France in her pretended abolition of the Slave trade; for here it
							appears that these vessels had undergone the examination of the French
							cruizers stationed upon the Coast, and passed inspection by them as
							engaged in lawful trade; while it further appears that one of the same
							vessels after being recaptured, returned to the Coast, took in a Cargo
							of Slaves, carried and landed them in the face of day at Guadeloupe. The
							President had inclined to the opinion that the vessel might be delivered
							up, by executive authority alone; and mentioned the case of a number of
							captured vessels which were so delivered up, at his application, by the
							British Government in 1806. <persRef ref="phipps-henry">Lord
								Mulgrave</persRef> being the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs—
							It was however concluded that the District Attorney at Boston should be
							instructed to make the suggestion to the Court; and they would then
							decide as they should see fit— The answer to the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef> would be
							regulated by their decision. At this meeting, it was also concluded,
							that the Note from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef> of 28 June last, on
							the case of the Apollon, should not be sent to the <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">District Attorney in Georgia</persRef>, to
							be used in the defence of the <persRef ref="clark-archibald">Collector
								of St Mary’s</persRef>, against the action of <persRef
								ref="edon-unknown">Captain Edon</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford at first thought it might be sent as enforcing the
							view heretofore taken by him, that there was no Spanish jurisdiction
							upon the spot where the Apollon was seized— But Gallatin’s assertion is
							that we had virtually taken possession of the spot in taking possession
							of Amelia-Island—now this is directly contradicted by evidence which we
							ourselves shall be obliged to introduce—which I explained to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, and he then said it would be
							best not to send a copy of Gallatin’s Note— He said also that this
							affair had brought up another claim for indemnity to the concerned in a
							British vessel, which under the Treasury order of May 1818 had been
							compelled to depart— The most extraordinary part of Gallatin’s conduct
							is that after a long argument to the French Government, upon grounds
							entirely new, and different from <pb type="ms" n="131"/>those we had
							taken here, he gives us distinctly to understand that he considers all
							these grounds, ours and his own as not worth a straw— I asked Calhoun
							to-day, what he thought it could mean. He said perhaps it was the pride
							of opinion— I think it lies deeper— Gallatin is a man of first rate
							talents, conscious and vain of them; and mortified in his ambition;
							checked as it has been, after attaining the last step to the
							summit—timid in great perils; tortuous in his paths; born in Europe;
							disguising and yet betraying a supercilious prejudice of European
							superiority of intellect, and holding principles pliable to
							circumstances, occasionally mistaking the left, for the right handed
							wisdom. There was something said at the President’s also, of a Question
							about the Jurisdiction of Carleton Island, in the River S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Lawrence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thompson, the Secretary of the Navy had received a Letter upon the
							subject which was given to me— There was already a Letter concerning it,
							with enclosures, from the Government of New-York, to be answered— After
							dinner, I was walking with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

								ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina" type="multi">M<hi

						<p><date>9. III:45.</date> I was disturbed this Morning, in my writing, and
							compelled to evacuate my room, while the top of its Chimney was
							undergoing repairs— They were however this day completed. I made a Draft
							of a Letter to the District Attorney at Boston, <persRef
								ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef>, and took it to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— Another question arose upon
							which I took the papers to him— A Soldier (Marine) has been sentenced by
							a Court martial to be shot, for mutiny. The President confirms the
								Sentence<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi>, but wishes to grant a
							conditional pardon, commuting the punishment. There is an opinion of the
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>, that the
							President has authority to grant conditional pardons, provided the
							condition be congenial to the Spirit of our Constitution and Laws; and
							recommends that the condition be a disgraceful expulsion from the
							service, and a disqualification for life to enter it again— <persRef
								ref="colvin-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colvin</persRef> to
							whom the papers were given to make out the pardon, brought them back to
							me, suggesting a doubt, whether a condition could be prescribed, not in
							the power of the party himself to perform; but depending on the
							performance of others; and also whether the disqualification can be
							carried into effect. For the Officers of the United States, might
							hereafter enlist him without knowing of his disqualification, and if he
							should enlist, the Government could no longer carry into effect the
							Sentence for his Execution— I did not see the indispensable necessity
							that the condition of a pardon should be performable only by the person
							pardoned himself; if it could be carried into effect by order of the
							Government prescribing it— Nor that the culprit would not be liable to
							Execution, if he should violate it himself by afterwards enlisting— But
							I thought the commutation was too great a mitigation, and substantially
							equivalent to an absolute pardon— After a sentence of death no mere
							expulsion could well be ignominious, and disqualification would scarcely
							be a penalty. I therefore proposed to the President that the condition
							should be the man’s departure from the United States, and never
							returning; of which there has already been one precedent in the first
							term of this administration— The President assented, and desired me to
							write to the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the

								Shaler,</persRef> Consul General to the Barbary Powers came this
							Morning to the Office. He has a leave of absence from his station for
							one year from last April, which he wished to have prolonged, a month or
							two more. He spoke of the Settlement of his Accounts, and mentioned two
							or three charges in them of a contingent nature, and of which he should
							claim allowance— I desired him to make a written statement of them, in
							the form of a Letter to me, and promised to lay them before the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> for his consideration— It was
							discovered by Shaler’s being here that there is a Treaty with Algiers,
							which has been here nearly five years, and which has not yet been laid
							before the Senate— It was made by him and <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"
								>Commodore Chauncey</persRef> in 1816. and was received here; in the
							interval, between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s removal from

							informed that there was such a Treaty here. It is with the exception of

								ref="edwards-alfred">A. P. Edwards</persRef> came for an answer to

							as there are several other applications, the President is not prepared
							to answer— Edwards said he should leave the city to-morrow, and wished
							to be answered by Letter to New-York, whence he expects to sail in about
							a week; first for a Port in Europe; and thence to go to Buenos-Ayres— I
							received a large packet of despatches from <persRef
								ref="worthington-william">W. G. D. Worthington</persRef>, the
							Secretary and acting Governor of East Florida—with all the
							Correspondence relating to the seizure of the Spanish papers there; and
							to the misunderstanding between our own civil and military authorities,
							about the use of certain public buildings— The President had requested
							me, to give him a minute of the subjects connected with our foreign
							Relations, which it would be proper to bring to the notice of Congress,
							in the Message at the opening of their approaching Session— I made this

								>President’s</persRef>, and consulted him upon these applications
							for Consular appointments in various parts of South America. For Lima,
							Buenos-Ayres, Carthagena and Angostura, there are such applications all
							at the same time— The Spanish authorities are falling away in every part
							of that continent. Peru has been revolutionized— Lima and Carthagena,
							have fallen almost at the same time into the hands of the Independents,
							and Mexico, is in a state of Revolution. Commercial speculators are on
							the alert in this state of things, and hence proceed all these
							applications for the Consular Offices— The President however decided
							upon one of them this day. He supposes that <persRef ref="prevost-john"
								>J. B. Prevost,</persRef> may have appointed <persRef
								ref="robinson-jeremy">Jeremy Robinson</persRef> at Lima, or if not,
							that <persRef ref="hogan-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and that <persRef ref="forsyth-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Forsyth</persRef> may wish for the appointment at Angostura— I
							asked the President what answer should be given to <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton’s</persRef> Letter about
							Carleton Island— It had been in possession of the British till the late
							War—was taken in 1812 and has not been restored since the peace. In
							1817. the Legislature of New-York made it part of the County of
							Jefferson in that State. Last March they granted 500 acres of land upon
							it, to <persRef ref="smyth-charles">Charles Smyth</persRef>, and in
							August <persRef ref="hagerman-christopher">the Collector of
								Kingston</persRef>, upper Canada, sent and seized and carried away a
							quantity of <pb type="ms" n="134"/>tobacco, consigned to, and in the
							possession of Smyth. He appeals immediately for protection to the
							Governor of New-York, and complains that if not supported he must break
							up his establishment and abandon the island— The Governor then writes
							me, that as the island is within the actual jurisdiction of the State of
							New-York, he should direct that any future molestation of the same kind
							should be met by resistance; but he thinks proper first to consult the
							opinion of the President of the United States— I told the President
							there was in this case a dilemma— If he should concur in opinion with
							the Governor of New-York, it would authorize immediate hostilities, with
							the British Government in Canada; but if he should discountenance that,
							and advise forbearance the establishments on the island would be broken
							up, and some of the Inhabitants probably ruined— The President desired
							me to send the papers round to the members of the Administration, and to
							call a Cabinet Meeting, for the day after to-morrow at Noon. I left with
							the President, the Spanish Minister <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin"
								>Anduaga’s</persRef> Letter, complaining of the piratical vessel
							fitting out at Baltimore, he said that measures had already been taken;
							but he would consult the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>; and endeavour to take yet others. He added that he
							thought the Spanish Minister assumed in his note a very high tone; as he
							certainly does— I told him I was afraid Don Joaquin would verify the
							character given of him by <persRef ref="brent-thomas">T. L. L.
								Brent</persRef>; and give us much trouble; but from the present
							condition of Spain I hoped we should have nothing worse than a war of
							words. The President also directed me to send round to the members of
							the Administration, a very interesting despatch just received from
								<persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>— Containing a
							statement of the commercial views, likely to prevail in the British
							Government— I spent the Evening writing in my Library— <persRef

						<p><date>15. IV:45.</date> Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>. All present except
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, who was unwell. He had all the
							papers relating to the Carleton Island question; but did not receive
							those sent yesterday from the Department of State, till two O’Clock this
							day. There were other papers, which I had not seen. A letter from the
							Collector at<space/><persRef ref="esselstyn-john">Esselstyn</persRef>,
							to the Secretary of the Treasury, written in May last; the answer in
							July—and Esselstyn’s reply in August, after the seizure of the tobacco
							by the <persRef ref="hagerman-christopher">Collector of
								Kingston</persRef> upper Canada. From all these papers it appears
							that Carleton Island is within a mile of the American shore at a place
							where the river S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Lawrence is 12 Miles
							wide. That it was held by the British during the revolutionary War, as
							an appendage to Canada; partly evacuated in 1784. again in 1789. but a
							corporal’s guard was kept upon it, until the late War, when in 1812 they
							were made prisoners, and in 1813. the buildings were destroyed by people
							from our side. After the Peace, possession was not resumed by the
							British— In 1817 the Legislature of New-York annexed it to the County of
							Jefferson, and last March granted 500 acres of land upon it to this
								<persRef ref="smyth-charles">Charles Smyth</persRef>, who has also
							obtained an appointment as Post-master, from the Post-Master General of
							the United States. But from the Letters of the Collector Esselstyn, as
							well as from various other indications, it is apparent that the place
							and the unsettled state of its jurisdiction, afford great conveniences
							for smuggling between the borders of New York and of Canada; and there
							are some reasons for surmising that this was the object of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Smyth’s Establishment. The
							question was what answer should be given to <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton’s</persRef> Letter, proposing
							to maintain the Jurisdiction by force; <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							inclined to the opinion that we should explicitly disclaim the
							Jurisdiction until the Report of the Commissioners, under the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 7<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>Articles of the Treaty of Ghent shall be made—it being apparent
							that the possession was in the British till the late War; and there
							being an express stipulation that the places taken during the War should
							be mutually restored. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt however hinted
							a doubt whether the British possession itself had been effectively
							maintained, referring to the partial evacuations of 1784 and 1789. But
							it seems to me that a Corporal’s guard was as effective to maintain an
							uncontested possession as the army of <persRef ref="xerxes"
								>Xerxes</persRef>; and that the possession was uncontested until the
							War of 1812. is apparent from all the papers. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> a Citizen of New-York, in the interest adverse to
							Governor Clinton, thought we should maintain the Jurisdiction, and
							consider the seizure by the Collector of Kingston as an act unauthorized
							by the Canadian Government; although at the time of the seizure the
							Officer himself who made it had declared that it was made by the express
							orders of the Governor— Thompson thought that if we should decline
							maintaining the Jurisdiction, Clinton would undertake it himself; would
							authorize force to be used, and then, make it a subject of reproach and
							clamour against the General Government that they had abandoned the right
							of the State of New-York. I thought this opinion a little tinged with
							party prejudice. The President thought I should write to <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> a statement of the facts; complain of the seizure
							by the Collector of Kingston, thereby disturbing the actual state of
							things while the question of the jurisdiction was sub judice before the
							Commissioners, and request his interposition with the Canadian
							Government to prevent any farther molestation by them of the people on
							the island, until the decision of the Commissioners which it is not
							doubted will assign the Jurisdiction to the United States— And then that
							Governor Clinton should be answered by referring to the fact that the
							State of New-York has not yet an established right of possession;
							wherefore the President cannot authorise or countenance the proposal of
							maintaining it by force— After about two hours of discussion without
							coming to any positive conclusion <pb type="ms" n="136"/>the meeting
							broke up, and the President kept the papers, saying he would further
							examine them, and then give me directions with regard to the answer to
							be made to Governor Clinton’s Letter. When the other Gentlemen withdrew
							I shewed the President <persRef ref="mix-unknown3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mix’s</persRef> papers— He had no
							recollection of the transactions to which they referred, but had no
							doubt of the correctness of Mix’s Statement, and said he was willing to
							do any thing necessary for obtaining the credit on the Treasury books,
							which he ought to have. There were also the papers in the case of
								<persRef ref="smith-joseph">Joseph F. Smith</persRef>, a
							Slave-trading Captain of one of the Baltimore vessels, covered by
							Spanish papers; convicted before the Circuit Court in Boston, and
							sentenced to three years imprisonment. Last winter he procured petitions
							from many respectable persons in Baltimore, for his pardon, upon a
							pretence trumped up, that there were two witnesses whose testimony he
							failed of obtaining at the trial, and that it would probably have
							obtained a verdict in his favour— The petitions were referred to the
							Attorney General, who recommended that the <persRef ref="blake-george"
								>District Attorney at Boston</persRef> should be written to, and
							enquiry made what would probably have been the effect of the testimony
							of the two additional witnesses— Blake answered that the fact which it
							was pretended their testimony would controvert was established by proof
							so clear and unequivocal, that the testimony of many witnesses to the
							contrary would probably not have shaken it, in the mind of the Jury; and
							a particular statement of the case as proved at the trial, drawn up by
								<persRef ref="davis-john">judge Davis</persRef>, confirmed the
							representation of Blake— The President to whom these papers were sent
							last Summer, returned them with the endorsement that he considered any
							interference on his part improper. Since then, Smith has got up another
							petition for pardon; and more respectable certificates from Baltimore,
							among which one from <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Sam<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, and the President has been again beset with
							affidavits and intreaties— Without recollecting that it was the same
							case, upon which he had already decided, he referred these papers again
							to the Attorney General, who referring to his former opinion in the
							case, again recommended enquiry of the District Attorney at Boston— This
							the President accordingly directed; but I this day brought all the
							former papers, with the report from Blake and judge Davis, and the
							President’s endorsed decision against interfering—which he of course now
							confirmed— Wirt remarked upon it, that from these insidious attempts to
							worm out pardons from the Executive, he doubted whether the President
							ought ever to issue a pardon upon ex parte representations. I delivered
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt the papers from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, relating to the Newfoundland
							fishing vessel piracy; for his opinion upon three points—1. Whether we
							can deliver up the British subject, charged with British Statute
							piracy?—2. Whether we can try our own Citizens, charged as accessories
							to the same crime? 3. Whether we can restore to the owners, the vessel,
							which is under seizure for a breach of our revenue Laws? On the first
							point M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning alledges an obligation by
							the Laws of Nations, to deliver up atrocious criminals— While on the
							enquiry this day for the papers in the Carleton-Island case, I returned
							twice from the President’s to my Office; and the second time met there
							the French Minister, <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron De
								Neuville</persRef>— I read to him my Letter to the District Attorney
							at Boston, upon the case of the Jeune Eugeniè; with which he appeared to
							be entirely satisfied. He said if the vessel was engaged in the
							Slave-trade, nothing was farther from his disposition than to screen the
							concerned from punishment; for France was perfectly agreed with the
							United States; both in the principle of suppressing the Slave-trade; and
							in that of refusing to agree to the right of search in time of peace— He
							said he saw the difficulty of accomplishing the suppression of the
							traffic without admitting this right of search; but he had proposed to
							his Government an expedient as a substitute for it—which was that the
							Cruizers of each Nation should have on board one Commissary from each
							Nation; and that then the search should be allowed, and made in every
							case only by the commissary of the Nation under whose flag the vessel to
							be searched should be met— He also asked me when I should be ready to
							take up the other subjects in discussion <pb type="ms" n="137"/>between
							us. I told him I should always be ready, whenever there should be a
							discernible prospect of our coming to an agreement upon any thing. I was
							sorry that I could discover none. He said as he has often said before
							that he and I could come to an adjustment in half an hour— I answered
							certainly, if I could be made to think as he did; or if he would adopt
							my opinions; of both which events I altogether despaired— He said then
							he should be glad to transfer the Negotiation back to Paris, where
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> might effect the object— I told him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin would be less likely to effect
							it, than we should here; for we had already offered more than he had
							thought we ought to offer or accept— Besides, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin would scarcely have time; for he was coming
							home—coming home? when?— I said probably next Spring— Oh! said the
							Baron, I shall go home too next Spring. He asked me, if we had received
							a copy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s Note to <persRef
								ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef>, on the case of the
							Apollon— I said we had; and were waiting to receive the answer which we
							presume has been given to it— He said what he most thought of was that
							our good friends the English were all this time profiting by our
							misunderstandings— Now I believe the Baron does not think much of this;
							but he imagines it to be a powerful argument with us— <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> used very much to fancy he could
							wheedle us, with our supposed Jealousy and hatred of the English—
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef> now and then
							touches upon the same key— Tis a common-place of Diplomacy— But it comes
							from none more ungraciously than from the Baron de Neuville, who has too
							much honest gratitude for the services of the English to the cause of
							his Master, to hate them himself, and who when striving hardest to
							imagine himself a frenchman of the old stock, never can get beyond the
							attempt to awaken the rancorous feeling of others— I barely replied to
							his remark, that the English were so much the common friends of both
							Countries, that if we could not agree between ourselves, we should
							rejoice at their profiting by our dissensions— He then took leave, and
							withdrew. <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							practise of making different appointments for the different Ports of the

							said it would be impossible for Burton to subsist there upon his
							Consulate— He doubted whether he would go; or if he should go whether he
							would stay; and he hinted that Burton had not dealt fairly with
							Hutchinson in applying for this Office— I told him that the Commission

							Hutchinson— <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> came to the

							of the Literary and Scientific Repository, a Quarterly publication which
							appears at New-York, and of which he says <persRef ref="armstrong-john"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Armstrong</persRef>, is the
							Proprietor, Editor, and almost sole author— The 5<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="livingston-robert">Chancellor Livingston</persRef>,
							and the other a Review of <persRef ref="wilkinson-james"
								>Wilkinson’s</persRef> Memoirs; both merely vehicles for virulent
							attacks upon <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, whom in one of them, the Review of Wilkinson, he
							charges with nothing less than Treason, to promote his own ambitious
							views— Lee, undertook some weeks since to make some comments upon the
							biography of Livingston, and to prove, that the merit and success of the
							Louisiana <pb type="ms" n="138"/>purchase Treaty belonged entirely to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe. Armstrong replied, first by
							an Article in the New-York National Advocate; and now in the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>number of his Repository. The two
							Articles, Lee says, are in substance the same— He says also that they
							might easily be answered, if he could have access to the Documents in
							the Department of State. Lee also told me, that when Armstrong was in
							France, he had printed an Edition of the Newburgh Letters, a copy of
							which he gave him with manuscript corrections in his own hand-writing.
							He says farther—that when he was here in 1811, <persRef
								ref="barlow-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow</persRef>
							being then about to embark for France, he, Lee and Wilkinson boarded in
							the same house; and he told Wilkinson some things that he knew about
							Armstrong; all which immediately afterwards Wilkinson went and told
							Armstrong himself. Armstrong immediately sued Lee for defamation, and
							laid his damages at a hundred thousand Dollars. Lee slipped off however
							before the writ was served and went to France. I received this Evening a
							Note from <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef>, with enclosures; being copies of
							applications from the <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governors of

								Vermont</persRef>, to the Governor of Canada, requesting him to
							deliver up, two fugitives, one from the State of New-York charged with
							forgery; and the other from Vermont, with murder— The <persRef
								ref="dalhousie-george">Governor General of Canada Earl of

								ref="colvin-john">Colvin</persRef> told me this morning, of the

							having a Newspaper here, devoted specially to my interest; but it suits

								ref="burlamaqui-jean">Burlamaqui</persRef> containing precisely the

								<persRef ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>—both these writers, as
							well as <persRef ref="grotius-hugo">Grotius</persRef> do in very
							explicit terms assert the moral obligation of Nations, to deliver up
							fugitives guilty of heinous crimes. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Wirt
							had the English translation of Grotius with a part of <persRef
								ref="barbeyrac-jean">Barbeyrac’s</persRef> Notes, and I had sent him
							the French Edition of Barbeyrac; which we compared together; but Wirt
							did not seem to be satisfied with the authorities— He wanted a Latin
							Grotius; but finally came to the denial of the President’s authority to
							deliver up. I told him that was the ground I had alledged to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, though I was not entirely
							satisfied that there was a want of authority— It was made by the
							Constitution the Duty of the President to take care that the Laws be
							faithfully executed, by which may be understood the Laws of Nations as
							well as the Laws of Congress— Now if it were clearly and unquestionably
							the Law of Nations that fugitives charged with heinous crimes should be
							delivered up, it would be the duty of the President to take care that
							that Law should be faithfully executed as well as others—and he could
							not be bound by the duty without possessing the authority necessary for
							its discharge— He said that doctrine was too bold for him: he was <pb
								type="ms" n="139"/>too much of a Virginian for that. I told him that
							Virginian Constitutional scruples were accommodating things, whenever
							the exercise of a power did not happen to suit them, they would allow of
							nothing but powers expressly written; but when it did, they had no
							aversion to implied powers— Where was there in the Constitution a Power
							to purchase Louisiana?— He said there was a power to make Treaties— Ay!
							a Treaty to abolish the Constitution of the United States?— “Oh! No!
							No!”— But the Louisiana purchase was in substance a dissolution, and
							recomposition of the whole Union— It made a Union totally different from
							that for which the Constitution had been formed— It gives despotic
							powers over the territories purchased— It naturalizes foreign Nations in
							a mass. It makes French and Spanish Laws a part of the Laws of the
							Union— It introduces whole systems of Legislation, abhorrent to the
							Spirit and character of our Institutions; and all this done by an
							Administration which came in, blowing a Trumpet against implied powers.
							After this, to nibble at a Bank, a Road, a Canal, the mere mint and
							cummin of the Law, was but glorious inconsistency— He said the People
							had sanctioned it— How the People?— By their Representatives in
							Congress; they were the People— Oh! said I, <hi rend="italic">that
								doctrine is too bold for me </hi>. But as to this power of the
							President to take care that the Laws of Nations be faithfully executed,
							without waiting for an act of Congress; it had been exercised by
								<persRef ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>, by
							seizing and restoring vessels illegally captured at the commencement of
							the Wars of the French Revolution, before any Act of Congress upon the
							subject; and it was now exercised continually by the admission duty free
							of baggage and Articles imported by foreign Ministers— All this seemed
							to make little impression upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, and
							I asked him whether he thought the Governors of the States had the power
							to deliver up fugitive criminals— He thought they had— I said it was no
							more delegated to them than to the President; and they no more, than he
							possessed any other than delegated powers— They were certainly not
							specially charged to take care that the Laws of Nations should be
							faithfully executed in their respective States, nor had they any power
							to arrest or detain any individual otherwise than conformably to the
							Laws of the Land. Wirt mentioned the Treaty of 1794, by which it was
							stipulated that persons charged with <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> and
								<hi rend="italic">forgery</hi> should be delivered up, from which he
							drew two inferences—first that it proved the sense of both parties that
							without the Treaty, there would be no obligation to deliver up criminals
							of any description; and secondly that even in making the Stipulation,
							the specification of those two crimes, was equivalent to an agreement
							that they would deliver up no others— I objected to both these
							conclusions; at least in their entire Latitude— I said that Stipulations
							in Treaties were often only in affirmance of principles which would
							without them be binding, and that the specification might only be of the
							two crimes for which the refuge would be most likely to be sought, and
							would be reciprocally most dangerous to bordering Countries. We both
							agreed that it was a subject deserving the attention of Congress— There
							was this Evening a party at <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton’s</persRef>, which George
							only attended. <persRef ref="lewis-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript"

							of it, and if I would call to-morrow, would read it to me. He meant to
							take a general review of our commercial system as founded upon the Act
							of Congress of 3. March 1815—and the subsequent Treaties and Navigation
							and restrictive Acts— I had brought with me the Draft of a Letter to the
							Secretary of East Florida, <persRef ref="worthington-william"
								>Worthington</persRef>—denying the right to sell the City Lots at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t. </hi>Augustine without an Act of
							Congress. It was approved— The President had sent me directions to write
							to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> upon the Affair of Carleton Island, and the
							substance of what should be said— I made the draft accordingly— He
							desired me this day to answer the Letter of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton</persRef>, and set forth the
							circumstances which render a resort to forcible resistance for
							maintaining the Jurisdiction of the State of New-York inexpedient,
							particularly the continuance of the British possession till the late
							War, and the Stipulation in the Treaty to restore all places during the
							War. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt adverted to the opinion
							expressed the other day by the Secretary of the Navy, that if we should
							answer thus, Clinton would use resistance of his own authority, and make
							it the foundation to raise a clamour against the General Government— I
							asked whether this was probable? Wirt said that <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson’s</persRef> opinion was founded upon his knowledge of the
							character of the man— He was <pb type="ms" n="141"/>himself not
							acquainted with Clinton. I said that with entire respect for the
							uprightness, candour and sound judgment of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson, I thought his anticipation might in this case
							partake a little of prejudice. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton
							was politically not in a condition to court a new quarrel with the
							General Government, especially in a case in which he would be manifestly
							wrong, and which could not possibly be of much effect— His experiment of
							last year, had recoiled too much upon himself to encourage him in that
							course. There was another light in which I thought it was but just to
							consider his Letter— He was Governor of New-York, and it was his duty to
							maintain the jurisdiction of the State— The Legislature had annexed
							Carleton island to one of their towns, and had granted lands upon it to
							one of their citizens— He had been molested in the possession of his
							Estate by foreign Officers— His resort naturally was to the State
							Executive for protection; and that of the State Executive, prudently to
							the President for advice— It did not follow because he had declared that
							he should consider himself justified in maintaining the actual
							Jurisdiction of the State; that he would disregard the advice which he
							asked, and do that in defiance which he had forborne to do without
							consultation— It was not for him as Governor of the State to anticipate
							objections to the jurisdiction asserted by the acts of the Legislature;
							but he might with perfect propriety acquiesce in such as should be
							suggested by order of the President in answer to his Letter— To all this
							the President assented; and desired me to send Governor Clinton a copy
							in confidence of my Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							relating to the subject.</p>

							did last Evening— I called this day at his house, and he read me the

							a general review of our commercial system founded upon the Act of
							Congress of 3. March 1815 offering the reciprocal repeal of
							discriminating duties: the Treaties subsequently made; and the
							Negotiations, hitherto ineffectual with France and Great-Britain— He
							said he meant to bring the whole subject before Congress for their
							consideration and revisal. They would thus have it in their power either
							to persevere in the system; or further to modify it, or finally to
							abandon it. He himself believed that the wiser policy would be to
							persevere. But some parts of the Country, specially affected by the
							operation of the system were uneasy under it, and it was desirable that
							the subject should be reconsidered in all its bearings by Congress. I
							had only one or two remarks to make upon the draft, which I did— He said
							he was waiting for one or two other Statements from other Departments,

						<p><date>22. IV:45.</date> The second parcel of arrears in this Diary, from
							the 24<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of August to the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of October last, which upon my return to
							Washington was to be redeemed has been effectually brought up, and I am
							writing the record of this day on the Evening of the day itself. There
							is yet a long hiatus of four Months from 17. April to 21. August to be
							filled— I found this morning at the Office, <persRef
								ref="elliott-unknown">a son</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="elliott-william">William Elliot</persRef>, the Clerk in the
							Patent Office, with an open Letter to be franked for <persRef
								ref="blagrove-william">William Blagrove</persRef>. There came two
							days ago, a Letter from Blagrove to Elliot, under cover to me, but
							sealed— I opened it, and found it containing a five dollar bill for
							copies of papers, and a promise of a handsome gratuity to Elliot if a
							certain patent could be obtained—requesting Elliot also to write to him
							under a frank— I desired <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> in sending or giving
							this Letter to Elliot to tell him I considered the promise of a gratuity
							improper, and that I did not chuse to be the vehicle of such a
							correspondence— I added that I was not punctilious upon trifles, but
							this was not the first time I had found Blagrove attempt to pass through
							my frank an improper correspondence; and I should consider M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot’s acceptance of a gratuity for
							doing business of an official character, still more so. The Letter was
							sent to Elliot— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent forgot to send
							or deliver to him my Message with it— Elliot however saw the
							exceptionable part of Blagrove’s Letter; and this Letter brought by his
							son, was his answer— It rejected with proper resentment the offer of a
							gratuity. The boy said his father considered it a rascally proposal. But
							that he believed I and <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> had not considered
							it in that light— I did not understand this till I found upon enquiry
							that my Message had not been delivered to Elliot. I desired that the
							original Letter of Blagrove, and a copy of Elliot’s answer should be
							sent me to be deposited in the office. <persRef ref="mason-john2">M<hi

									>r</hi> William North</persRef> as Consular Agent at Lima— I
							told him the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had not
							thought proper to make any appointment; because <persRef
								ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prevost</persRef>
							had been authorised to make such an appointment; and there was reason to
							believe an appointment had been made by him. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef><pb type="ms" n="143"/>the Secretary of the Navy
							came to enquire what answer, he should give to the Letter which he had
							received from a <persRef ref="king-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> King</persRef> about Carleton island— I read to him the
							Draft of the Letter which I have written by the President’s direction to
								<persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef>, and told him I was to send a copy of that Letter
							to <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton</persRef>— I bantered
							Thompson a little upon the avidity with which the Legislature of New
							York had seized upon the Canadian derelict island, which by good right
							belonged not to New-York but to the United States— I also spoke to him
							of <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> substitution of
							his son <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> as a candidate
							for a Midshipman’s warrant, instead of his eldest <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">Son, Thomas</persRef>; of my application two
							years ago for a warrant for <persRef ref="whitcomb-thomas">Thomas
								Osgood Whitcomb</persRef> of Boston; and of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="fiske-oliver">O. Fiske</persRef>, asking for <persRef
								ref="fiske-unknown3">his Son</persRef> an appointment of Surgeon’s
							mate— He said he could answer that immediately— There were no such
							appointments to be made— I called at the President’s, with my draft of a
							Letter to Governor Clinton; which with two slight additions suggested by
							him, he approved— I had sent him yesterday the gross budget of
							despatches received, of which he had read the greater part— I told him
							that upon reading the packet from <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius"
								>Fromentin</persRef>, a doubt had occurred to me, whether the
							mention, made of him in the Message was not too favourable— The papers
							now received from him were written three weeks after <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> had left Pensacola; when
							there had been time for the blood to cool, and there was not the same
							excuse for excitement— Instead of diminishing, they had increased in
							violence— They were altogether insupportable— One was a long declamation
							to prove himself not a weak man; of which that argument was its own
							refutation— The other was an argument smothered in invective against
							Jackson, begging the question of his non-Jurisdiction, and then railing
							at him for a tyrant, usurper and assassin— These papers were such that
							if communicated to Congress, they would excite universal disgust; and
							yet they were written apparently with the purpose of publication; for
							they were mere inflammatory appeals to popular feeling; and if they
							should not be communicated, I should not be surprized, if Fromentin
							should complain that they were suppressed— I had thought therefore that
							it might be proper for me to write to him distinctly expressing to him
							the President’s disapprobation of these papers; informing him that from
							regard for himself they had not been and would not be communicated to
							Congress, unless after an opportunity of reconsideration, he should
							himself desire it. The President approved this idea, and said
							Fromentin’s conduct appeared to be that of desperation. He had lost his
							character and consideration in Louisiana; he could not go back there.
							Circumstances connected with his domestic affairs had deeply affected
							his standing in Society, and this dispute coming upon him unexpectedly
							seemed to have impaired his intellect— He the President was afraid it
							would totally ruin him— As to the notice of him in the Message, perhaps
							some sentiment of regret at the temper manifested on both sides might be
							proper, and due to the character of the Government. I said that this
							would place them both on the same footing which would be scarcely just—
							Jackson had perhaps used intemperate language personally to Fromentin—
							He had written him in the heat of excitement one intemperate Letter, but
							he had communicated nothing of this to the Government— He had complained
							of Fromentin’s interference with his authority, but in no improper
							terms— The President said it would deserve further consideration— The
							disagreement between the Commissioners, under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent, and
								<persRef ref="bradley-william2">W. C. Bradley’s</persRef> papers were
							mentioned by the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— I
							asked him if among the mass of papers I had yesterday sent him, he had
							read a private Letter from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes
									j<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> at Stockholm. He said
							he had— It contained an extract of a singular Letter from <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry">Goulburn</persRef> to Hughes, ridiculing the
							reference of the Slave question to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor of Russia</persRef>; and adding that it was all M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi><pb type="ms" n="144"/><persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin’s</persRef> fault, for that they (the
							British Government in 1819) had offered to compromise the affair by
							paying us a sum of money, at once, to get rid of the whole question; but
							Gallatin had declined agreeing to this— The President thought it
							extraordinary that this fact had never been communicated to us either by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin or M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush— But what I particularly noticed Goulburn’s Letter for
							was his apparent dislike of the reference, which probably indicates the
							sentiment of the British Government— Now this reference was no more a
							favourite of mine than of theirs— In the Slave case however it was the
							simplest of all possible questions— A question upon the true meaning of
							a single sentence— I had almost said of a single word— But the question
							upon the unsettled boundary, on which the Commissioners under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Ghent Treaty had been
							after five years of examinations and surveys, and discussions unable to
							agree, was of a very different character— It would be impossible for a
							foreign Government even to understand the question without an
							investigation which must consume years— It would scarcely be prudent to
							refer a second question to the Emperor of Russia, who could not fail to
							give dissatisfaction to either party against which he should decide the
							first: and there was no other Sovereign in Europe whom we could consider
							as sufficiently independent for an umpire, unless it were the <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor of Austria</persRef>, with whom we have no
							political Relations. I thought therefore that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush should be instructed to sound the British Government,
							and ascertain whether we cannot settle the affair, by negotiation
							together without recurring to the arbitrament of any third power. The
							President assented also to this— I asked him whether in the Draft of the
							Message, enumerating the documents relating to the repeal of the
							discriminating duties, the Treaty with Sweden had not been omitted. He
							said it had; but he would take care to supply the defect. I mentioned
							likewise the second Algerine Treaty, and the accident by which it had
							not yet been laid before the Senate. He said it would be proper to
							explain this in the Message to be sent to the Senate with the Treaty.
							Upon the questions of certain changes in <persRef ref="shaler-william"
								>W. Shaler’s</persRef> accounts, he said he would consult the other
							members of the Administration to-morrow, when he wished a meeting at
							Noon; not to read the Message; but to submit the question whether any
							new taxes should be recommended to Congress. I made some remark upon the
							arrangement of the topics in the Draft which the President had read to
							me yesterday— It had been copied since yesterday, and the arrangement
							altered, as I had intended to suggest; so as to throw together all that
							related to our commercial system, keeping it distinct from the parts
							alluding to the Slave question, and the Florida Treaty.</p>

						<p><date>23. VI:15.</date> Cabinet Meeting at the President’s at Noon— Full—
							The question submitted by the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> was whether it was expedient that in his
							Message to Congress he should recommend the establishment of internal
							taxes. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> had his estimates for the service of
							the ensuing year; and the returns of receipts in the Treasury, for the
							three expired quarters of the present year, and the whole of the last—
							The receipts from the customs, which are almost our only revenue have
							been every quarter of the present year less than they were in the
							corresponding quarters of the last— The deficiency however of the third
							quarter has been very trifling and there is no doubt that the receipts
							of the present quarter will exceed those of the last quarter of 1820.
							The whole amount of the receipts from the customs in that year was a
							little over 15 Millions— Those of the present year will not much exceed
							thirteen Millions. The falling off in our revenue the three last years
							has been very great, and its principal cause has been the fallen value
							of our principal articles of export; and the reduction of the enormous
							mass of artificial capital in Bank credits and paper— It appears that
							the lowest point of this depression was about the close of the last <pb
								type="ms" n="145"/>year; but the present is the year in which it has
							been most sensibly felt in our revenue. The impost is collected upon
							bonds, payable at periods from 6 to 12 Months of their dates, and the
							average collection upon the bonds of every separate year, is of about 23
							per Cent of the whole amount in the course of the same year; 75 per
							cent, the year following, and two per Cent, the second year after— The
							average receipts of the present year have been less than three Millions
							and a half each Quarter: but since the commencement of the third Quarter
							they have been steadily, but slowly increasing; so that we may hope the
							revenue of the following year will equal that of the last year— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crawford and <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> discussed the
							details both of receipt and expenditure, much at length— Crawford said
							that if he could assume for certain that the impost would yield 15
							Millions, the revenue would then cover the expenditure of the year. But
							he thought it would be necessary to look forward to the year 1825, when
							about ten Millions of the present debt 7 and 6 per Cents, will become
							payable, and he, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun thought now
							the time for offering to convert these 7 and 6 per cents into 5 per
							Cents, which they thought the creditors would be glad to do— The 5 per
							Cents being now in the market as high as the six per Cents, and both
							higher than the 7. per Cents because it is known that the Stocks bearing
							the highest interest will be the first paid off— They calculated that
							this operation alone would reduce the payments on the interest of the
							public 300000 dollars a year and be equivalent to the extinction of 5
							Millions of debt. I did not object to the experiment, but doubted much
							whether it would be accepted by all, or even by a large portion of the
							creditors— I told them also that I had no belief the public Stocks would
							continue for four years to come at their present market prices. I
							thought it much more probable they would within that time be down to par
							and perhaps lower. I thought they had been as low as 99 within these 4.
							years; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said they had not
							been less than one per Cent above par since 1817— He said there might be
							some alteration advantageously made in the tariff; and instanced
							particularly the article of linen, now rated at 15 per Cent ad valorem,
							and which might be safely raised to twenty. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun thought this would make a very trifling addition to
							the revenue, and that only for one or two years. By the year 1825 he
							believed it would on the contrary be less productive at 20 than at 15
							per Cent— He said the manufacturing interest now was so flourishing that
							it was gradually reducing the revenue by impost, and would continue so
							till he was convinced some other mode of taxation would become
							indispensable— The prosperity of the manufactures was now so clearly
							established, that it might be mentioned in the message as a subject of
							congratulation— That, said Crawford, would immediately bring down upon
							you <persRef ref="duane-william2">Duane</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles</persRef>— The President put the question
							whether additional taxes should be recommended— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> answered they did not think it necessary— I said
							I thought the same, so far as concerned internal taxes. They would
							require the organization of a whole system for collecting them. The
							appointment of many Officers; and a process of considerable expence. And
							it would give general dissatisfaction to the people— There were good
							grounds for expecting that the imposts of the ensuing year would yield
							15 Millions, in which case, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							assured us the expenditure would be covered by the income of the year.
							But as there was some uncertainty upon the subject if by some slight
							alterations of the tariff, an additional half a million could be
							secured, it ought not to be neglected— No additional expences of
							collection, no new Officers would be required. The increase of duty
							would scarcely be felt, and it would have the advantage of conceding
							something to the manufacturing interest, which has been so long
							complaining, and which has considerably suffered. I was therefore in
							favour of proposing the increase of the duty upon linens from 15 to 20
							per Cent. <pb type="ms" n="146"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							said there would not be much trouble with the manufacturing interest at
							the ensuing Session of Congress— He had seen last week a member elect
							from Pittsburg in the Pennsylvania Legislature, who told him there had
							been a great change of opinion there on the manufacturing question— That
							he had himself an interest in a manufacture, but was of the party not
							desirous of a new tariff— That the ticket supported by this interest had
							been chosen by a majority of 100 votes in Pittsburg itself, and that the
							Majority in the County was of 600— Calhoun said he had been told that
							the whole struggle of the Pittsburg Manufacturers, had been an effort to
							keep up the prices of their goods, while all the articles of
							agricultural produce, had fallen almost to nothing— Flour for instance
							down to two Dollars a barrel— I said I had no apprehension that there
							would be much debate upon manufacturing interests; and whatever
							exertions they might make would be outreasoned and outvoted. But as they
							were great and very respectable interests; if any thing could be
							conceded to them, at the same time subserving another useful purpose, I
							thought it would be recommended by sound policy. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun said he should assent to it, on the score of policy;
							but he did not think it would ultimately benefit the revenue, and he
							thought Silks would be a better Article for an increase of duty than
							linens— The decision was unanimous against any recommendation of
							internal taxes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had a Letter
							from the <persRef ref="petry-jean">French Consul General
							Petry</persRef>, requesting the Liberty to ship 26 Boxes of objects of
							natural history, animal, vegetable and mineral; for the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">king of France</persRef>; by a French vessel,
							which has entered the Port of New-York, in distress— The <persRef
								ref="gelston-david">Collector</persRef> has refused permission for
							the shipment; unless tonnage duties should be paid— But as the Articles
							are not objects of Commerce, and are for the public uses of a foreign
							Sovereign, it was concluded that the permission should be given for the
							shipment, without payment of tonnage duties. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun brought on the discussion of a proposal, made by
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> of the Michigan
							Territory for preventing the Indians dwelling within our boundaries from
							resorting to Malden annually to receive presents from the British
							Government— This is an old practice against which we remonstrated about
							two years ago, without success— They refused to supersede the usage, and
							immediately gave notice to the Indians of our demand, and their refusal—
							The Presents, Governor Cass says have been more abundant than they had
							ever been before— But from various considerations arising out of this
							subject, it was determined not immediately to take any decisive step
							concerning it— Governor Cass recommends, that in preventing the Indians
							from receiving the Presents of the British Government, we should
							indemnify them in part, and I think entirely, for their loss by
							increasing our own gifts. He thinks also we should in the first instance
							endeavour to wean the Indians from this connection by persuasion and
							admonition; the efficacy of which may be doubted— I think also that when
							we undertake to sever this intercourse against the will of both parties
							we should undertake it with great deliberation, and determined
							perseverance; and that we should give full notice of our intention to
							the British Government, as well as to the Indians. The motive of the
							British Government in continuing these Presents is to keep the Indians
							in reserve as auxiliaries in a future War, with us. This is a
							dishonorable Spirit of hostility maintained in the midst of Peace— But
							if we break up the intercourse, it should be in a manly and spirited
							way, giving due notice and assigning sufficient reasons— I spoke of the
							charges in <persRef ref="shaler-william">Shaler’s</persRef> Accounts—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson the Secretary of the Navy
							took Shaler’s statement but objected to the allowance of 500 dollars for
							acting as judge advocate on a Court Martial— He said he allowed judge
							advocates only 10 dollars a day.— I received on returning home a note
							from <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef>, enclosing a copy of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="george-iv">the King of Great-Britain</persRef>, to the United
							States of America, announcing the Death of <persRef
								ref="caroline-brunswick">the Queen</persRef>, and requesting me to
							take the President’s pleasure with respect to the time when the

							should desire it himself— He said Winder thought Fromentin had been

							him; and believed that upon cool reflection, he would himself ask to
							withdraw the papers— I had received this morning Letters from <persRef

							4.23. first part of the verse—“And he said unto them, Ye will surely say
							unto me this proverb, Physician heal thyself:”— It was a discourse upon
							proverbs and prejudices— After the Meeting I called to see <persRef

								Meigs</persRef>, but did not find him at home— By the Mail I
							received a despatch from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C.

								>Count Engeström</persRef>, concerning an American vessel which had

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton’s</persRef>. The French
							Minister, <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, came and had a long and somewhat angry
							conversation with me, upon the state of our affairs, and especially upon
							the case of the Apollon. He said that he had informed me that he had
							been instructed by his Government to continue the discussion concerning
							that vessel, the Neptune and the Eugene; and he wished me to answer his
							last Note upon that subject, upon which he should reply, according to
							the Instructions which he had received— That he was instructed to keep
								<pb type="ms" n="148"/>that affair distinct from all others; and
							that it must be settled the first of all— I asked him if there had been
							any answer given to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s</persRef> Note of the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of June— He said there would no doubt be
							given some answer, but his Government thought the affair should be
							settled here. Not that they had any objection to treat with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin— He had always treated them,
							respectfully, and although they were not pleased, with his advice that
							in the commercial affair this Country must do itself Justice, yet the
							French Government would not on that account decline treating with
							him—but they chose to settle that matter here; and three or four days,
							after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s note had been sent in,
							his, De Neuville’s Instructions had been despatched, and a copy of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s note with them— I asked him
							whether he had received any Instructions written since his Government
							had been made acquainted with the Correspondence between him and me on
							the subject last Summer. Without directly answering this question, he
							said that his Government saw the thing exactly in the same light that he
							did— As to the commercial negotiation; our ideas were widely different;
							but France could not accept the proposals we had offered— The French
							Government could not do it, if it would— But it was determined that this
							affair should be disposed of first— I knew very well what his sentiments
							concerning it were. They were very different from mine; but those of his
							Government were precisely the same as his own— This day he had received
							a private Letter from France; saying that affairs are getting embroiled
							with the United States; and he cannot conceive what there should be for
							France; and the United States to differ about— I said it was at least
							not a difference of our seeking— We asked nothing of France, not even a
							Treaty of Commerce— As to the case of the Apollon; he had insisted upon
							our acknowledging that a great error had been committed, and then
							explained that he meant by subordinate Officers of this Government— That
							we had answered there had been no error of subordinate Officers— If
							there had been any error it was our own; but we were conscious of none—
							We had done only what we thought the Law authorised and the case
							required. If therefore he wished to find the cause of difference between
							the United States and France, it was not to us that he must look for it—
							We demanded nothing. But his demand was that we should unsay what we had
							said— He said that it was noble and generous in this Government to
							support its Officers; but the order of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of May 1818 was not warranted by Law, nor was <persRef
								ref="jones-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>
							the chief Clerk of the Treasury warranted in writing that it was
							applicable to the case of the Apollon; nor was the vessel treated
							according to the terms of that order. He said much about <persRef
								ref="edon-unknown">Captain Edon’s</persRef> being a man of honour,
							and referring to his transactions in entering his vessel, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine and posting her at Bell river,
							said he had done nothing but what he had a right to do. He intimated
							rather indistinctly that there ought to be an enquiry in Congress as to
							the legality of the Treasury order of 6. May 1818. and said that within
							two or three months American vessels would be arrested in the French
							Ports, for the affair of the Apollon, the Neptune and the Eugene— I
							understood him to say this upon his word of honour— He had previously
							said that if a similar affair had happened to American Citizens we
							should have been equally urgent in demanding satisfaction, upon which I
							declared to him with much earnestness, and from the bottom of my Soul,
							speaking as I said not as a public minister, but as a man, that we
							should not, very far from it, that we never should have said a tenth
							part upon it, of what he has already said— When he came to his
							declaration that American vessels would be arrested in the Ports of
							France; I paused until he ran through his declaration about the honour
							of Captain Edon, and took no notice of his hint about an enquiry in
							Congress—as soon as he stopped— I said that I had understood him to say,
							that upon his word of honour, American vessels would within three Months
							be arrested in the Ports of France; he said that the Declaration upon
							his word of honour, related not to that, but to something else— But as a
							private individual he had declared as his opinion, that within three
							Months American vessels would be detained in France, unless satisfaction
							were given for the cases of the Apollon, the Neptune and the Eugene;
							because they were considered, universally considered as outrages, upon
							the flag and National Honour <pb type="ms" n="149"/>of France— They
							would be brought forward in the Chamber of Deputies, and measures of
							reprizal demanded, and unanimously agreed to; for the <hi rend="italic"
								>Libéraux</hi>, would be more ardent for them than any others. I
							said I had understood him to say on his word of honour that American
							vessels would within three Months be arrested in France— I was happy to
							hear his explanation that he only gave this as his private opinion, and
							should make Report of the whole to-morrow to the President— He seemed
							startled at this, but said I might report to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> what I pleased— I said I
							should report exactly what had passed between us, and no more; as I had
							first understood him, and as he had afterwards explained. He then in a
							loud and peremptory tone, rising from his seat, and with vehement
							gesture said, well Sir, since you think proper to Report to the
							President, what I came here, to say in confidential conversation with
							you, I desire you to tell him from me as my individual opinion, that if
							satisfaction is not made to France in the Affair of the Apollon, the
							Neptune and the Eugene—La France doit leur declarer <hi rend="italic">La
								Guerre</hi>— These last words he spoke in a manner nearly frantic,
							dwelling upon the word <hi rend="italic">Guerre</hi>, with a long and
							virulent emphasis, and without waiting for a reply rushed out of the
							Room, and through the inner and outer street doors, into the street— I
							followed him composedly with a light— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> happened to be in the Entry, as he sallied forth,
							and followed him to the Street door, calling out “Monsieur; vous avez
							oublié votre Surtout”— He turned back and put on his Great Coat; but
							said nothing further to me— This incident gave the Catastrophe something
							of an air of burlesque—but the whole scene left me leisure for very
							serious reflection— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams on returning
							from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton’s, soon found me to be in a
								<hi rend="italic">brown study</hi>.</p>

							Washington City Library; also any public Documents, U.S. Laws, or other
							Books which I could give them— <persRef ref="taylor-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Taylor</persRef> called— He is
							going shortly to the Northward, to embark for Carthagena, as soon as he
							conveniently can— But as there is a prospect that Mexico will shortly
							become likewise independent of Spain, he desired in case there should
							soon be an opening at Vera-Cruz, he might be considered as a Candidate
							to exchange his office at Carthagena, for a similar appointment at Vera
							Cruz. I told him I would mention it this day to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, which I did. But I told
							Taylor that although it would be personally quite agreeable to me that
							he should obtain the Office at Vera-Cruz, I ought in candour to tell him
							that I believed there had been an application for that place very
							respectably recommended, and already of one or two years standing— At
							one O’Clock, I went to the President’s and presented to him <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> the British Minister, who delivered to him the
							Letter, the President’s and presented to him M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning the British Minister, who delivered to him the
							Letter, from the <persRef ref="george-iv">king of
								Great-Britain</persRef>, announcing the decease of <persRef
								ref="caroline-brunswick">the Queen</persRef>— The President told him
							that he received the communication with all the <hi rend="italic"
								>Sympathy</hi> which the Event was calculated to inspire— This was
							gravely said—the rest of the interview savoured of dulness, and was
							rather long, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning apparently waiting
							for the nod, to be dismissed— Something was said about the Turks and the
							Greeks—Something about the Harvest in England wet or dry, and something
							about the British kings visits to Ireland and Hanover. I told him we
							must all be grateful to <persRef ref="smythe-percy">Lord
								Strangford</persRef> for interposing to save from destruction the
							relics of Athens— As we retired, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							reminded me that I owed him four Notes. I asked him if that about the
							Newfoundland Pirates was one— He seemed as if suddenly to recollect
							himself that this was a fifth— I told him the papers had been with the
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">attorney General</persRef> for an
							opinion; which I hoped would enable me to answer him very shortly. He
							spoke of the seizure of some of our vessels on the Coast of <pb
								type="ms" n="150"/>Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, upon which he said
							he was sorry to be informed that the indulgence which he had solicited
							could not be granted. I asked him if he had received my Letter about
							Carleton Island— He said he had— After he retired, I told the President
							the substance of the Conversation which I had last Evening with the
							French Minister, at which he was much surprized, and quite indignant— I
							told him I thought it would require a modification of his Message to
							Congress; and that instead of saying as he had proposed that with the
							exception of the disagreement upon the commercial negotiation, our
							relations with France are friendly, it would be necessary to refer
							immediately to the affair of the Apollon and the claim under the
							Louisiana Treaty; and to communicate all the Correspondence upon both— I
							considered this explosion of De Neuville’s as offering a fair
							opportunity for both; and I thought it fortunate that it had happened
							before the Message was delivered; for if that had spoken of friendly
							relations, without communicating the papers on those two subjects, and
							immediately afterwards this quarrel had burst upon the Nation, the
							Administration, would have been liable to the charge of having
							suppressed the real state of things— The President fixed a cabinet
							meeting for to-morrow at eleven O’Clock, and concurred in the opinion
							that all the papers must be communicated— He said that De Neuville had
							once before been very offensive in his communications, and that it had
							been all but determined to demand his recall. He added that it would be
							necessary now to determine what course to pursue— If Congress should be
							of opinion we had been wrong, it might be proper to settle what
							concession should be made— If not, we shall know upon what ground we
							stand— But if we should make any concession, he would instantly demand
							the recall of De Neuville. I told the President that a concession that
							we were wrong would be humiliating enough; but it would be worse than
							that— It would be unjust— I had a firm, and certainly an honest opinion
							that the seizure was both legal and right. What was most embarrassing to
							me was those who were bound in duty to support our cause, had abandoned
							or betrayed it. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> in a Report to
							Congress last winter had seemed to give up his own ground—for the
							Treasury order of 6. May 1818. was his own Act— The <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">District Attorney in Georgia</persRef>, on
							the trial of the vessel for the seizure managed the cause feebly, and
							wrote me that he thought the seizure could not be defended; and that he
							believed the <persRef ref="davies-william">District judge</persRef> was
							of the same opinion and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, most unaccountably
							had not only taken ground in his Note to the French Government totally
							different from that which we had taken ourselves; but in his letter to
							me had given me distinctly to understand that he considered his own
							ground and ours equally without foundation. His own, was certainly
							untenable not only for the reason assigned by him, but because the fact
							as it must be proved by ourselves was against it— These were
							discouraging circumstances, and increased the difficulties of the case;
							but I still thought the argument on our part sound— At all events we
							must now go before the world with it— The President desired me to send
							him the most material papers of the case; particularly the Treasury
							Order of 6 May 1818. and to bring with me tomorrow copies of the two
							Letters of <persRef ref="clarke-george3">G. J. F. Clarke</persRef>, to
								<persRef ref="forbes-james">James G. Forbes</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy, came in almost
							immediately after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning went away, and
							was present, at this conversation with the President. He had with him
								<persRef ref="shaler-william">Shaler’s</persRef> Letter claiming an
							allowance of 500 dollars for acting as judge Advocate to a Court Martial
							in the Mediterranean— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson said that
							the established allowance for a judge advocate on a naval Court Martial
							was 10 dollars a day; and that upon the Court in question which was a
							Court of Enquiry into the cause of certain duels, between Officers in
							our Squadron; and British Officers of the Garrison at Gibraltar, there
							was an attendance of about 12 days— Shaler stated that he had paid 150
							dollars for a person to <pb type="ms" n="151"/>assist him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson supposed, by copying papers, and
							thought the charge too high; but as it was money paid, it must be
							allowed— Thompson said Congress last winter had overhauled some charges
							similar to this of Shaler’s, and there had been an opinion of censure
							expressed upon the allowance of them— The President said Shaler was an
							excellent officer, and faithfully discharged his duties; but this charge
							if allowed would rather injure than serve him; and he desired me to see
							and converse with him about it— The President also read me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="winder-william-henry">General Winder</persRef> to him,
							requesting permission to him, to withdraw the papers received from
								<persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">judge Fromentin</persRef>— I
							thought the Government could not safely withdraw them, or suffer them to
							be withdrawn; at least not for the present. The President concurred in
							this opinion. On returning to the Office, I found a despatch from
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef> of 1.
							September, with copies of the voluminous correspondence between <persRef
								ref="stroganoff-unknown">Strogonoff</persRef> the Russian Minister
							at Constantinople, and the Porte— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

							distribution of the public buildings at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Augustine, which he desired me to examine and consider, and to bring
							with me to-morrow to the President’s. I told Calhoun of the Scene last
							Night with de Neuville, at which he was somewhat astonished— I stated to
							him the grounds of our vindication—the Law defining the District of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s, and the opinion of the Supreme
							Court of the United States in the case of <persRef ref="church-john2"
								>Church</persRef> and <persRef ref="hubbart-unknown"
								>Hubbard</persRef>, which I read to him from 2. <persRef
								ref="cranch-william">Cranch’s</persRef> Reports 232.236. he said
							that opinion was very strong, in favour of the principle, and that our
							case was much stronger than he had thought. Evening at home writing, but

							There was a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef key="monroe-james"

							request I stated the circumstances of <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Neuville’s</persRef> conversation with me last Sunday Evening, and
							the President submitted the question, how the present state of the
							Relations with France was to be noticed in the Message. The Treasury
							order of 6. May 1818. and the subsequent correspondence were read: the
							seizure of the Apollon, was stated; that part of the French Minister’s
							Letter of 3. August last, which related to this case, and his note of
							15. October, announcing that he had received new Instructions from his
							Government, to continue the Negotiation on that point separately from
							all others— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> who had not been present at the former Meetings held
							on this subject, and had not seen the voluminous correspondence relating
							to it, on the naked fact of the seizure, beyond the limits of the United
							States, and within the Jurisdiction of Spain; strongly expressed an
							opinion against the legality of the seizure; <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> inclined the same way, and after the passage in
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Cranch’s</persRef> Reports had been
							read, they thought that it recognized an extension of Jurisdiction only
							out to Sea, and not in the case of a river with an exclusive adverse
							jurisdiction upon the other side— But in the case of the Apollo; there
							was no adverse jurisdiction upon the other side. It was a desert, where
							a false pretence of a spurious Port was made for the express purpose, of
							evading the Laws of the United States— The discussion principally turned
							upon this point; but when the material circumstances of the case were
							made known to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, he said it was on the
							part of the French Minister, the most impudent thing he had ever heard
							of in his life— Still the point recurred of the seizure within Spanish
							Jurisdiction— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> said that was a matter for us to settle with
							Spain— France <pb type="ms" n="152"/>had no right to make any claim upon
							us for that— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> thought she had; if
							there was a wrong done to French Subjects. I thought so too upon broad
							and liberal principles; though I observed the usual practice of Nations
							was otherwise; and that France had invariably refused satisfaction to
							us, for wrongs done to us by her privateers and Consuls within Spanish
							jurisdiction— We had obtained satisfaction for them from Spain; by the
							late Treaty; but never from France— It was asked whether there had been
							any complaint from the <persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Spanish
								Minister</persRef> in this case— I said there had; but I had
							answered him, and sent him copies of the <persRef ref="clarke-unknown3"
								>Spanish Vice-Consul Clarke’s</persRef> two private Letters
							disclosing the plot against the Laws and revenues of the United States,
							and since that, had heard nothing further of the matter from him—
							Calhoun said that was a complete answer to Spain—and the answer to
							France was also complete— Various modes were suggested of the manner in
							which the state of this affair should be made known to Congress, and
							there seemed a general agreement that it should be by a short paragraph
							in the message, with a communication of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
							correspondence— But I then observed, that the publication, of this
							Correspondence would have the unavoidable effect, of exciting irritation
							in the feelings of the people of this Country against France— That it
							might probably excite temper on both sides, and possibly the time might
							come, when De Neuville would complain of this proclamation to the world
							of our differences upon a mere confidential conversation, in which he
							avowedly spoke only of his private opinion. I therefore suggested
							whether after the Message and all the Documents should be prepared,
							ready to be sent to Congress, it would not be well that I should send
							for de Neuville and tell him that the President had prepared his Message
							to Congress stating that with the exception of the difficulties of the
							Commercial Negotiation our Relations with France were entirely
							amicable—that after the Conversation of last Sunday, it was impossible
							for him to say that— He proposed therefore to mention the two other
							subjects in discussion and to communicate all the correspondence that
							had passed— But as the effect of this publication might be to increase
							rather than to allay excitement, I was directed to inform him of the
							cause of the publication that he might if he thought proper avert it, by
							further explaining himself as to what he meant on Sunday— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said that this reason, of the
							public excitement which must be occasioned by the publication was a
							strong motive for not communicating the Correspondence with the Message—
							A step to which he from that time appeared to be strongly averse— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, thought there was danger in
							leaving at De Neuville’s option whether the papers should be
							communicated or not; for he might unsay all his threats of Sunday, to
							parry the publication, and then should France commit reprizals, the
							President would still be chargeable with having suppressed the real
							danger of the Country— He thought therefore it would be best that I
							should write to de Neuville and ask him to explain himself officially— I
							said that de Neuville’s call upon me, was for an Answer to his note of
							3. August, by which I could immediately bring him to an explicit
							declaration. But he had told me, that his private opinion was that
							France ought to declare war if satisfaction was not made to her in the
							cases of the Apollon, the Neptune and the Eugene; and he had before told
							me that his Government saw these things in the same light that he did— I
							was apprehensive therefore that by provoking a reply from him now it
							would be a peremptory and menacing demand of satisfaction; and if the
							Correspondence to be sent in to Congress should close with such a paper
							as that the shock upon Congress and upon the public mind would be great,
							and unexpected— It would be better to prepare them for it gradually—
							Crawford said he believed that De Neuville’s reply would be a short and
							peremptory demand of satisfaction. That he had told that his Government
							viewed the outrage upon the honour of the King and flag in a much more
							aggravated light than he did—and that in a conversation with him in
							September, the very day upon which Crawford was taken sick—De Neuville
							had told him that France must have satisfaction, he, Crawford had then
							said; why what will she do? for as we have taken our ground in the
							discussion, it cannot be expected that we should retreat from it— Upon
							which De Neuville had said that she <pb type="ms" n="153"/>should send
							and seize two or three American vessels at Nice or Passages, and
							confiscate them. Crawford said he had replied that she would surely not
							do that— As he was taken ill the same day, he had not informed the
							President of this Conversation, and it had since escaped his
							recollection— There was some enquiry whether I could answer his Note of
							3. August so as to draw his reply, in Season to be communicated to
							Congress next Tuesday— I thought not— My Answer must be a long one;
							entering into a considerable detail of facts; to which he would also
							reply in detail, even if he should conclude as I expected he would with
							a peremptory and offensive demand. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Crawford said an immediate publication might make us liable to a charge
							which had heretofore been brought against us, of precipitately
							publishing negotiations while they were pending— I said that did not
							appear to me a good reason for withholding the publication, but if any
							thing the reverse— We had indeed been charged with precipitate
							publication; but that very publication had been one of the wisest and
							most effective measures ever adopted by this Government; to which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford assented— I acquiesced however in
							the determination, that the Correspondence should not be communicated
							with the Message; but with the Understanding that it shall be
							communicated at the proper time— And then, I proposed that the two
							private Letters of the Spanish Vice-Consul Clarke, should be placed in
							front, as furnishing the key to the whole controversy— I had mentioned
							De Neuville’s insinuation, that the Treasury order of 6. May 1818. and
							my opinion that it was applicable to the case of the Apollon, ought to
							be made a subject of enquiry in Congress— Crawford said this was very
							extraordinary— The Treasury order had been communicated to Congress,
							last year— But what had de Neuville to do with any proceedings of
							Congress in the case?— I said it had appeared to me so extraordinary,
							that I had hesitated whether I should even report it— He had said it
							indistinctly, and might disavow, or explain it away. But he did say what
							I so understood— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford seemed to be
							desirous that the whole affair may appear to have grown out of the Act
							of Congress of 15. May 1820—and it certainly was an efficient cause— The
							primary one however was the Treasury order of 6. May 1818. and Crawford
							does appear not at all earnest for its publication— He is less confident
							than I am of its legality, and more apprehensive of the effect of public
							discussion upon it— I am not without doubts upon that bare point of
							legality though I am fully satisfied that every sound principle of
							reason and of Justice is with us— After returning to my Office I
							received several despatches from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, the latest being
							of 26. September, and from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>
							of October. From those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin it
							appears that no answer had been given to his note of 28 June in the case
							of the Apollon— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina" type="multi"

						<p><date>28. V:</date> Morning visits from <persRef ref="rhea-john">M<hi

								ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> of 5. October, and from
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef> of 11.
							September, partly, both in cypher— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> called at the Office, and desired me to go over
							to his House to meet the other members of the administration, who were
							already there, with the exception of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> whom he would immediately call upon— I left M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton’s P.S. with <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>,
							requesting him to decypher and send it over to the President’s, and took
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s Letter and his cypher over
							with me— I decyphered the part of it which was in cypher while the
							President was reading the despatch from Gallatin of 26 September which I
							had received and sent over to him yesterday— The President then read the
							paragraphs he had drawn up since yesterday, mentioning the state of the
							Negotiation relative to the Louisiana Treaty Claim, and to the cases of
							the Apollon, Neptune and Eugene— They were somewhat in detail, and the
							question by the President was whether they should be thus stated, <pb
								type="ms" n="154"/>or briefly by a paragraph of a few lines— No
							objection was suggested to the paragraphs as the President had written
							them— He asked if we had any observations to make on them. I said that
							they dwelt with sufficient proof on the sentiment that France had no
							cause of complaint against us; but the real fact was the reverse— We
							were the injured party from the beginning. If that position could be
							assumed rather more distinctly and explicitly, by an additional sentence
							it might be useful— The President answered that what he had said bore
							directly upon the French Government— It was expressed in a conciliatory
							Spirit— He had stated facts from which the inference could not fail to
							be drawn that the wrong had really been done to us— He had thought it
							better to leave it to that inference than to make a direct charge of it—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford concurred with this view— He
							thought it decidedly best that the Correspondence should not be
							communicated now; and by thus presenting the facts to the world,
							possibly France herself might see that it would not be necessary nor for
							her interest to push us to extremities on these points. If she should
							persist however, so as to render the publication of the documents
							necessary, the Message will have already stated facts upon which our
							true ground as the injured party may be consistently asserted and
							maintained— The President said that his object was to put France as much
							as possible in the wrong. He believed that we could not have a quarrel
							with any one member of the holy alliance, without bringing down the
							whole body of them upon us. They all hated us for our principles— They
							dreaded the effect of our example; the standing refutation of their
							doctrines in our prosperous condition, and the danger to themselves in
							our constantly growing power— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> said it was
							evidently not the intention of the French Government to agree with us
							upon any one point— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford thought they
							did, upon the commercial Negotiation, and that they made the most of the
							other points in order to bring us to terms upon that. But he said the
							quarrel arose from the Act of Congress of 15. May 1820. <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">De Neuville</persRef> went to France
							immediately afterwards— He; Crawford had then written to Gallatin that
							he expected de Neuville’s representations would be unfavourable— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had answered him that they had
							really been so. That before he came the <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne"
								>French Minister Pasquier</persRef> had shewn a more accommodating
							disposition— But de Neuville had told them that in the Act of 15. May
							1820. Congress had not precisely known what they were about— That the
							Southern members were against it; and that at the next Session it would
							be repealed. He had imagined all this, and from that time Baron Pasquier
							became more intractable; and de Neuville came back supposing that we
							should immediately yield the point— <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> I think said,
							France could not possibly have any motive for going to War with us.
							Calhoun said the French Government hated us— The President said, if they
							did go to War with us, he believed we should overset them all— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford said the Ministry were now very
							strong— They had the entire controul of the Legislative bodies; he then
							handed to me a Letter which he had just received from <persRef
								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, mentioning the fact
							that a motion had been made in the House of Peers, at the last Session
							of the Legislature, to arrest and prosecute him for a speech made by him
							in the chamber of deputies— Crawford added that he had been informed
							from another quarter that two of La Fayette’s own nephews had voted in
							the house of Peers in favour of the motion to arrest him— La Fayette in
							the Letter requested Crawford to shew it to the President and me; and
							added that he intended to write to us both— From M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s Letters received yesterday and this day it
							appears that no answer had been given to his note of 28 June, upon the
							case of the Apollon, nor had it even been mentioned to him. He therefore
							entertains the opinion, that this point will be pressed as well as the
							Louisiana Treaty claim, only to obtain indemnity for the damages
							sustained by <persRef ref="edon-unknown">Edon</persRef> and the parties
							interested in the voyages of the Apollon, Neptune and Eugene, and to
							obtain commercial concessions, or make a set off, for <pb type="ms"
								n="155"/>claims on our side— But by the partly cyphered Letter of 5.
							October it appears that Gallatin had had a conference at Pasquier’s
							request with him concerning the discriminating duties; and that this,
							though Pasquier did not tell him so, was at the suggestion of the
							Russian Ambassador, who had manifested some uneasiness at the growing
							alienation between the United States and France— The French Minister it
							seems had insinuated to the <persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Russian
								Ambassador</persRef>, that we were partial to Great Britain; the
							hint of which Gallatin says must have come from America— (Crawford made
							upon this a remark perfectly characteristic. He said he supposed de
							Neuville had written it in consequence of my answering, when he
							pretended to regret that we would not agree to the French proposals of
							commerce; <hi rend="italic">because the English would profit by it</hi>;
							that if we could not agree, together, at least we could not object that
							a common friend, should profit by it; and the English were our common
							friends— I said it could hardly be in consequence of that— For this
							insinuation of our partiality to England, made in France in September,
							and suspected by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to have then
							come from America, could hardly be in consequence of what I said in
							conversation with De Neuville, not a fortnight ago. (it was on the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of this Month: see the Journal of that
							day) I had never said this, or any thing like it to De Neuville before—
							But said Crawford, it was before last Sunday— I said yes— This I say was
							characteristic— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had first
							mistaken entirely the time when I had made the remark to De Neuville,
							and then had built upon that mistake the inference that De Neuville had
							in consequence of it, charged us with partiality to the English— And
							Crawford’s own motive was to insinuate that my observation to de
							Neuville was a maladdresse which had subjected us to this imputation.
							And if this explanation had not now taken place, a week would not have
							passed before Crawford would have told in confidence half a dozen of his
							friends, the whole of this affair with all its misconceptions,
							insinuations and conjectures, as a proof of my indiscretion— All this is
							par Parenthese) Gallatin says that he assured the Russian Ambassador
							that our partiality, was directly the reverse of the insinuation, and in
							favour of France— Pasquier told Gallatin that they should increase the
							duties upon our Cotton, and the premium upon importations from America;
							upon which Gallatin, intended to write him a Note— Upon the whole there
							is evidence nearly conclusive of a disposition inveterately hostile to
							this Country in the French Government; and I am convinced it is
							approaching a Crisis. I suggested a wish that as the Correspondence was
							not to be communicated with the Message, to avoid an immediate call for
							the papers; the President should add that the subject being still under
							Negotiation, they would be communicated in the course of the Session if
							occasion should require. To which the President agreed. After the other
							members of the administration had withdrawn, I said to the President,
							that in recommending to Congress a Review of our whole commercial
							system, I had understood him to say that his own opinion was that it
							ought to be maintained. He said it was— I observed that it would not be
							necessary, perhaps not proper that in the Message, he should express his
							own opinion. It might be advisable to leave the deliberations of
							Congress unbiassed— But I thought it very important that if any member
							of Congress should be desirous of knowing what his opinion was there
							should be neither doubt nor hesitation, concerning it— I would confess
							to him; not only that I thought the present system ought to be
							maintained, but that it was of the utmost importance to the welfare of
							this Country that it should be maintained— A liberal principle of
							commercial intercourse with foreign Nations, was in my view one of the
							ingredients of our national independence— It originated with our
							national existence— It had then been established as a fundamental
							principle of our relations with other powers, deliberately adopted, and
							after full discussion— It was proclaimed to the world in our first
							Treaty with France, in terms certainly inserted by our Ministers; I
							supposed by <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Franklin</persRef>. That France should have subscribed to them
								<pb type="ms" n="156"/>at all, was extraordinary— She had never
							spoken such language in any Treaty before. That principle we had
							invariably maintained until now— <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> had reasserted it
							in his Report to Congress in 1793. the act of 3. March 1815—offered it
							again to the acceptance of all Nations— We had departed from it, I
							believe for the first time in this Negotiation with France, by acceding
							to a principle of discriminating duties to operate avowedly against
							ourselves— We had not satisfied France; she wanted more inequality—to be
							candid with him I was glad she had not accepted our offer. I had always
							been averse to making it, and should have felt inexpressible reluctance
							in signing any Treaty containing it— France was now giving us notice
							that she intended to take further measures to force us into her terms.
							There was a diversity of opinion in Congress and in the Country upon the
							policy of persevering in our policy; and I had taken the Liberty of
							making these remarks to him, because I thought it not improbable, that
							the decision of Congress might be, what his opinion would recommend— He
							said it should not upon any proper occasion be withheld. There was sent
							me while I was at the President’s an award of arbitrators in favour of
								<persRef ref="bowie-washington">Bowie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kurtz-john">Kurtz</persRef> of more than 8000 dollars— The
							President directed that it should be paid. At the Office, <persRef

							came from <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>29. V:</date> Morning visits from <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi

								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John W. Taylor</persRef>, Speaker of
							the House of Representatives at the last Session of Congress to myself.
							I had a free conversation with him of about an hour upon political
							subjects, at the close of which, he made me an explicit offer of
							confidential intercourse during the ensuing Session— Taylor was chosen
							Speaker last year, after an unexampled struggle of 23 Ballots, and
							finally obtained it only by pledging himself to some of his colleagues
							that he was not a partizan of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>— When he went home in the Spring, his own
							re-election to Congress in his District being at stake, and Clinton’s
							friends being the majority there, he took the Clintonian side in
							supporting their candidates for the State Legislature— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							was of opinion that Taylor was partial against the Administration, and
							in coalition with the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> and <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>
							parties; and that he did much mischief by the appointment of unfriendly
							Committees. As a great majority of the New-York Delegation to the
							ensuing Congress are anti-Clintonians, and as Calhoun has much influence
							over many members of the house, it is certain that Taylor will not be
							re-elected Speaker, unless the influence both of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and of Calhoun can be secured
							in his favour, or neutralized— I consider this overture from him as a
							promise of good behaviour if he should be chosen Speaker, and although
							there has been some obliquity in his career, I do not think that he
							ought to have the affront, passed upon him, of electing another Speaker—
							He gave me to understand this day, that he should not be in favour of
							any further reduction of our Establishments—that he should be averse to
							any new loans— That he should have wished an excise upon Spirits had
							been recommended—and that he should be satisfied with partial
							alterations of the Tariff for the benefit of the manufacturers. He said
							he had strongly recommended to <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> to be content with
							that last year, though without success— I accepted his offer of
							confidence, and told him the principal substance of what the Message
							will be, in relation to domestic affairs— <persRef ref="ironside-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ironside</persRef> came with the
							papers relative to the Newfoundland Piracy case which I had left with
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef>, and he with <persRef ref="maury-fontaine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef>, to transact the
							business at the Treasury Department—but nothing was done— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford having objected, that the
							Officers who seized the vessel had a claim for salvage.— I called at the
							President’s with the papers, which I read <pb type="ms" n="157"/>to the
							President— The vessel belonged to Newfoundland; was runaway with by the
							Captain, who brought her in to Mount Desert— There she was seized for
							the violation of our revenue Laws— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s</persRef> demand is that she
							should be restored to the owner, as having been stolen from him—
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt’s</persRef> opinion is that she ought to be restored, with
							permission to sell what has been saved of her Cargo. The question is in
							what form the order from the Executive shall issue— The President was
							himself not informed, and desired me to consult with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt. I called at Wirt’s Office, and enquired of him if in
							his opinion of the President’s power to remit, he had reference to any
							particular Act of Congress: he said no; but to the general authority
							granted him by law. I then went to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford’s Office and consulted with him— He said that the Officers who
							had seized the vessel had represented to him that they had a heavy claim
							for salvage— The seizure had been twice made, and once resisted. There
							had even been a man wounded in that resistance. The Government could not
							release that claim of individual right— But he would write to the
								<persRef ref="jordan-meletiah">Collector</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="preble-william">District Attorney</persRef> to-morrow,
							directing the discharge of all prosecution on public account, and
							authorizing the sale of the Cargo, if consisting of goods not
							prohibited—(I said I supposed the Cargo, was fish; the sale of which he
							said was not prohibited.) and he would send me to-morrow the Letters of
							the Collector, to enable me to reply to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning— This affair occupied so much of the day, that I had not time
							left for writing. While I was at the President’s, he asked me if I did
							not think <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef> ought to be immediately instructed to propose
							and negotiate a commercial Treaty with Russia— He thought that by taking
							advantage of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> ill
							humour with England, we might secure to ourselves all the advantages of
							commerce which the English have heretofore enjoyed. He said this in
							consequence of the cyphered despatch received yesterday from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton. It was read at the Cabinet
							Meeting, without any material remark being made upon it— I now told the
							President that Middleton must undoubtedly be instructed with reference
							to his cyphered despatch— But as to a Treaty of Commerce; it would be
							well to authorize him to talk about it, rather in the way of receiving,
							than of making proposals— One of the persons of the Emperor’s household,
							had urged him to propose a commercial Treaty, saying that our former
							overtures to that effect had been defeated by English influence— That
							now was a more favorable time. That <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Nesselrode</persRef> would in the first instance say no; but upon
							being pressed would yield— That our Squadron in the Mediterranean might
							aid the Emperors cause, which would be that of the Greeks— That the
							Emperor’s movements of hostility would commence in February; and that
							Austria, and perhaps England had made an Alliance with the Turks against
							Russia— Now the object of this was apparent, to bring us into a <hi
								rend="italic">political</hi> connection with the Emperor— Our
							Squadron in the Mediterranean was its object—a commercial treaty was the
							lure— But we were supposed to be anxiously desirous for such a Treaty—
							Our true policy was to be always willing and ready to treat of Commerce
							with Russia, and rather desiring it; because that desire would always be
							received as a mark of esteem and respect—but we can really obtain
							nothing from Russia of any importance in a commercial Treaty— She has no
							discriminating duties, no Colonial monopolies to remove— All the trade
							between us is carried on in our vessels. She imports from us sugar,
							coffee and raw cotton; without heavy duties, and all we could possibly
							obtain, would be a trifling reduction of them— For every thing thus
							obtain an equivalent would be exacted, and that would now evidently be
							political— I knew the Emperor Alexander had a rooted personal aversion
							to commercial Treaties, considering them as they really were uncongenial
							to the policy of Russia; he had always refused to renew the old
							commercial Treaty with Great-Britain, and always hitherto declined a
							Treaty with us. If he had now changed his mind, we should soon discover
							that for any advantage he might be disposed to yield, he would claim for
							equivalent more than it would be worth— The President said he <pb
								type="ms" n="158"/>would on no consideration whatever get into any
							political entanglement with Russia. I also mentioned to the President
							that in the draft of the Message that he had read yesterday, there was
							some observation tending to excuse the <persRef ref="edon-unknown"
								>Captain</persRef> of the Apollon, which I wished him to
							reconsider—the Captain certainly did not deserve it; and I was
							apprehensive that in the discussion, unfair advantage would be taken of
							the concession— He said he would immediately look to it. <persRef

								the Land</persRef> Office— I told him I would rather speak to them;
							and advised him as to the mode of making his application— Morning visits
							from <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson</persRef> a Senator from Kentucky; from his brother
								<persRef ref="johnson-john2">John T. Johnson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="woodson-samuel">S. H. Woodson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="smith-john9">J. Speed Smith</persRef>, members of the House of
							Representatives, also from that State; and from <persRef
								ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickenson</persRef>—of New-York, with whom I had conversation, upon
							the prospect of election of a Speaker— He said there was a majority of
							the New-York Delegation, who had determined not to vote for <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef>— They had held a Caucus at the
							City of New-York on the way and had so resolved—they considered Taylor’s
							conduct as marked so strongly by duplicity last year that they would on
							no account vote for him; but they had not determined for whom they would
							vote; but there were eleven members from the State, who might be
							prevailed upon to vote for Taylor; if they were convinced that he would
							be sincerely friendly to the administration— I told Dickenson, that I
							had never on any occasion spoken to a member of Congress upon the choice
							of a Speaker, before or pending an election— But if the question was to
							turn on the friendliness of the Speaker to the Administration, I had
							reason to expect that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor would be
							friendly— As friendly as the Administration could wish, and as would be
							consistent with his independence— And from various important political
							considerations I wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor might be
							re-elected— The choice of another now, would be passing an affront upon
							him— It would cast some discredit upon the State of New-York; and would
							have the appearance of bringing into the councils of the union the
							unfortunate internal dissensions of the State of New-York. Dickenson
							said that his own disposition was the same; he thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor had not been fair towards the
							Administration in his appointments of Committees last year, but he had
							positively disclaimed all intentional hostility in those appointments;
							and he hoped he would not pursue a course of hostility now— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickenson I would see him again upon the
							subject before Monday— On calling at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> I found the deputations of Indians were
							there— Seventeen Chiefs of Pawnees, Pawnee Loups, Pawnee Republicans,
							O’Mahas, Otos, Missouris and Kansas were assembled, and sitting upon,
							Sophas round the central Hall, and one of them had just finished a
							speech to the President, who was present with the Secretaries of War and
							the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Navy</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="ofallon-benjamin">Major O’Fallon</persRef> the Indian Agent who
							accompanied them, told the Interpreters to inform them, that we were
							three of the great Counsellors of the Nation, and to ask them to shake
							hands with us, which they all successively did— They were all large,
							tall men, with countenances deeply expressive. Most of them with painted
							faces— The upper parts of their bodies were covered only with blankets,
							and in extending their arms to shake hands they uncovered them as well
							as their necks and breasts— They approached more in their appearance to
							the primitive state of Nature than any other Indians that I had ever
							seen— They were informed that they would receive the answer to the
							speech another day, and the President took leave of them and withdrew to
							his cabinet, whither I followed him. I mentioned to him the
							Conversations which I had had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickenson, and asked him whether he
							thought it advisable to express any opinion or take any part relative to
							the choice <pb type="ms" n="159"/>of a Speaker— He said he believed the
							proper course would be to take no part in it, at-all. I suggested to him
							the reason, upon which I thought a change would be a public
							inconvenience. He said he would think of it, and give me a final answer
							to-morrow. The President also spoke to me of the attacks upon him by
								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef>, in the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 6<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>numbers of the Philosophical and Literary Repository— He said he
							had not read them. He had received Letters from several of his friends,
							advising that notice should be taken of them. He had really not thought
							it worth his while to get involved in controversy with a man about whom
							the public opinion of this Country was already made up, and had placed
							him so exactly where he ought to be. But he had collected a number of
							documents relating to the Louisiana Negotiation which he had meant to
							leave for his children, and which he would shew to me— He said that
							precisely at the time when he had arrived at Paris, <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, being then first
							Consul, came of his own will to the determination of selling the whole
							of Louisiana to the United States. He determined also to employ in this
							negotiation <persRef ref="barbemarbois-francois">Marbois</persRef>
							instead of <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles"
							>Talleyrand</persRef>—ostensibly because it was a fiscal concern for
							raising money, but really on account of the scandal incurred by
							Talleyrand in a prior negotiation with American Envoys— For this
							determination of Bonaparte’s, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe said
							he neither did nor ever had claimed any merit whatsoever— But before he
							arrived at Paris he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="livingston-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Livingston</persRef>, entirely discouraging as to the prospects of
							the Negotiation— The same night that he arrived at Paris he spent the
							Evening with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston, and <persRef
								ref="mercer-john2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l. </hi>John
								Mercer</persRef> was present and took minutes of the conversation
							which passed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston asked him if he
							had read the Correspondence which had been transmitted to the Department
							of State, before he M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had left
							America—he had—would he wish to see the subsequent part of it, until his
							own arrival at Paris?—he would— Then he would send him his Letter Book,
							containing it, which he did— The last Letter was one from Talleyrand,
							received while M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was on his passage
							to France, and totally declining any Negotiation for Louisiana— The
							actual negotiation commenced almost immediately afterwards, and was no
							sooner concluded than the same kind of reports were circulated among the
							Americans in Paris, as Armstrong is now endeavouring to propagate. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, before proceeding to England told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston that he desired to have
							copies of that correspondence, which had passed before his arrival in
							France; and accordingly the book was sent to him; but that last
							declining Letter of Talleyrand’s was not with it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe then went to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston, reminded him of that
							particular Letter, and after some awkward apology from him was actually
							produced— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had a copy of it made,
							which he kept Afterwards when he came home and into the Department of
							State he found that a copy of this identical Letter had in the first
							instance been withheld, and never sent to the Department, until after
							his copy of it had been taken and was in his possession. The old man he
							said had used these means to secure to himself the credit of the whole
							Negotiation. Two years ago, when he, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe was at Pittsburg, an address had been presented to him in which
							this Louisiana Negotiation, was brought into view— In his answer he had
							thought it proper to refer the transaction to the Administration, adding
							that a full portion of credit had been due— The turn that Armstrong had
							given to this concession was, to represent the compliment in the address
							as too gross even for him to swallow entire, and his acknowledgment that
							part of the credit was due to another, as equivalent to the proof that
							none was due to himself— As to credit he claimed none. Bonaparte’s
							Resolution to sell was dictated by the circumstances of the times— He
							would take no step to affect the credit of a man who was dead, who was a
							man of talents and had rendered services to the Country— He should only
							hold it his duty to see that correct statements of the facts should be
							preserved— As to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><pb type="ms" n="160"
							/>Armstrong, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison proposed to
							bring him into the Administration, he had opposed it; because he had no
							confidence in him. But at that time a military man was wanted at the
							head of the War Department, and when <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> concluded to appoint
							Armstrong, he, Monroe told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison that
							he would harmonize with him to support the administration. I told the
							President that I had seen the publications of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Armstrong—that very little notice of them had been taken by
							the public—their interest was merely historical— I thought with him that
							it was neither necessary for him nor worthy of him, to enter into
							controversy with Armstrong— With regard to the facts, I should be happy
							to receive any communication from him at his convenience. I received
							visits by card, from <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham</persRef> of Massachusetts and
								<persRef ref="warfield-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Warfield</persRef> of Maryland— At the Office, <persRef
								ref="preble-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Preble</persRef>
							called, late Consul at Palermo, and soliciting a new appointment
							elsewhere; and <persRef ref="sterling-unknown3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sterling</persRef> a member elect of the House of
							Representatives, who brought me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="chaumont-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le Roy de
								Chaumont</persRef>— <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
								Cranch</persRef>, and <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi
