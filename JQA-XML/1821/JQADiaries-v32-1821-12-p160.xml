						<p><date>1. V:30.</date><persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> called this morning at my house, and I
							consulted him with regard to the election of a Speaker— Found him very
							decided against <persRef ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef>, but not
							decided whom to support in his stead. He did not expect <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> would be here; and if here did not believe he
							would consent to be a candidate— He had been too much mortified at his
							failure last year— <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">Nelson</persRef> would be
							friendly to the Administration; but the principal objection to him was
							his being a Virginian. There was already an inordinate proportion of
							Citizens of that State in all the Departments of the Government. But as
							to Taylor, a large majority of the New-York Delegation, would not only
							vote against him; but would be much dissatisfied, if there should be any
							movement of the administration in his favour. And it would not only
							indispose them, but almost the whole of the Pennsylvania delegation too—
							I urged the ill example of changing the Speaker on mere grounds of party
							personality— That it has hitherto been unexampled since the existence of
							the present Constitution— The mischief of bringing into the Government
							of the Union, the squabbling of New-York State politics. He replied by
							insisting on the unnatural aspect of the administration supporting one
							who at least had always acted as their enemy; against those who had been
							its warm and steady friends— I found him so fixed that it was of no
							avail to press him further upon the point— He said he thought the field
							of Attack upon the Administration would this Session be narrowed— He is
							more sanguine of the increase of the revenue next year than I am; and
							spoke with the utmost confidence of having four Millions in the Treasury
							at the end of the year, after all its expenditures paid— I told him I
							could only hope it would so turn out.— I had visitors, at the Office;
								<persRef ref="bronaugh-unknown">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bronaugh</persRef>; with Letters and Accounts from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>: <persRef
								ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H.
								Baldwin</persRef>, from Pennsylvania, and <persRef ref="morgan-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. J. Morgan</persRef> from
							New-York, members elect of Congress, and <persRef ref="watkins-tobias"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins</persRef><pb type="ms"
								n="161"/>who borrowed of me <persRef ref="park-james"
								>Parke</persRef> and <persRef ref="marshall-john"
							>Marshall</persRef>, and the French Marine Ordinance upon Insurance. He
							said he had a Letter from <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tazewell</persRef> in answer to his
							queries; from the purport of which he inferred that Tazewell adhered to
							his opinions— He had no answer from <persRef ref="white-hugh">judge
								White</persRef>, though he had written him five Letters— He also
							told me that <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">Baptis Irvine</persRef> since
							he parted from <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliot</persRef> had
							repeatedly been to him and professed the friendliness of his disposition
							to me; and his readiness to serve my political advancement. I told
							Watkins, that if I had any objects to promote by purchasing the Editor
							of a Newspaper, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Irvine was not worth
							buying— If management of that kind were consistent with my principles,
							which it was not; and if I had the talent for it, which I have not, and
							if I thought Irvine worth purchasing for any thing, I would pay him to
							write for my competitor— I did believe Irvine to be at bottom an honest
							man— But he was a foreigner; he had no American conceptions; and did not
							know the way to American hearts. His ideas were confused— His opinions
							Quixotic, and his principles my aversion—especially those which he has
							most stubbornly and odiously maintained, against the Supreme Court of
							the United States— Far from buying him therefore, I would not accept him
							as a gift. I want no supporter who holds his principles. His natural
							market is elsewhere. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morgan spoke to me
							of <persRef ref="smith-gerard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerard
								Smith</persRef> an applicant for the Consulate of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomew, or elsewhere— I told him how
							it had happened that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith could not be
							appointed to that Island; and how he would be disappointed in almost any
							other Consular appointment, as he had been in that of La Rochelle—
								<persRef ref="trimble-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								Trimble</persRef> of Kentucky called also at the Office, but I did
							not see him. Upon a Summons from the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, I attended a Cabinet Meeting at his house at
							two O’Clock. It was to read the whole Message; almost all the separate
							parts of which had been repeatedly read, and discussed before— All
							present except <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> who was indisposed— After the reading
							various remarks were made, some by <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and some by me, upon which slight alterations,
							corrections, and additions were made— The President then asked if it
							should be read by paragraphs; but that was deemed unnecessary. There was
							a general acquiescence in the whole message— After the other members of
							the Administration had withdrawn, the President told me that he had
							concluded to take no part whatsoever in the election of the Speaker—
							That he had given and should give no opinion on any side; and he had
							enjoined as strongly as he could both upon <persRef ref="hay-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef>; both of whom were however quite independent of
							him; yet he had enjoined upon them to say nothing upon the subject to
							any one— I told him that under the circumstances, I should do the
							same—would inform <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dickenson</persRef> of it, and also if he pleased
							communicate it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor himself; to
							which he assented. I then read to the President the Letter received this
							day from General Jackson with the enclosed papers against <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">judge Fromentin</persRef>; upon which I told
							him that it would deserve consideration whether some modification of
							that part of the Message which related to the difference between Jackson
							and Fromentin should not be made— As it stood it placed them both on a
							level; giving them both credit for upright intentions, and expressed no
							censure of either— I thought they did not stand upon a level; and that
							they ought not to be represented in the same light— He directed me to
							send these papers round to the other members of the Administration, and
							said we would meet again upon it— I asked him if they should be sent to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford— He said at first yes; but
							afterwards recollecting himself said no— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford having been ill when the papers were formerly considered, and
							not having seen them— I gave the papers to <persRef ref="brent-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>, desiring him to
							take them to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun; to point his
							attention to a certificate of <persRef ref="butler-robert">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Butler</persRef>, confirming in the
							strongest terms a certificate before given by D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bronaugh, the truth of which Fromentin had most explicitly
							denied; and to request him after perusal of the papers to pass them over
							to <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef>.</p>

						<p><pb type="ms" n="162"/><date>2. V:45.</date> I received this morning a
							Note from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, asking
							for the papers received yesterday from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef> concerning <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">judge Fromentin</persRef>; and for other
							papers heretofore received from both— I answered that I had according to
							his directions sent those received yesterday to <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>;
							and that the rest were at the Office which was closed; but that I would
							take measures to have them all sent to him in the course of the day, or
							early to-morrow Morning— <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickenson</persRef> called upon me;
							and I told him of the President’s determination, to take no part
							whatever in the election of the Speaker— He said that the majority of
							the New-York Delegation had now come to their determination— They would
							support <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rodney</persRef>, and if they could not succeed with him they were
							to take up <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lean</persRef>, both members from Delaware— This was in
							consequence of an interview between a deputation from the majority of
							the Delegation, and the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, who was exceedingly inveterate against <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef>,
							and approved of the other nominations— But he said the Southern members
							were not for supporting Rodney, because they considered him as a
							Clayite— I went with <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> to the Bath-Room— Met M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun on the way. He had the papers
							received yesterday from General Jackson with him, and promised to leave
							them at the President’s, as he passed— There was no preaching at the
							Bath-room, <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef> being sick. The Doctor and George returned home. I
							went to the Presbyterian Church at the foot of the Capitol Hill and
							heard <persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post</persRef>, from Acts 10.1. and 2. “There was a certain man in
							Cesarea called <persRef ref="cornelius">Cornelius</persRef>, a centurion
							of the band called the Italian band— A devout man, and one that feared
							God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed
							to God alway.” The Sermon was an analysis of the character of Cornelius,
							with a comment upon the superiority of practical over mere theoretical
							religion, and an earnest exhortation to imitate the virtues of
							Cornelius. I met at the Church <persRef ref="hill-mark">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M. L. Hill</persRef> of Maine,
								<persRef ref="montgomery-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Montgomery</persRef> of Kentucky, and <persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood</persRef> of New-York— I called
							on J. W. Taylor at his lodgings; and found him in his chamber;
							apparently under some agitation. After some conversation upon the
							Census, and the publication of the Secret Journals of the old Congress,
							and some accidents which have befallen some of the members of the
							New-York Delegation on their way, he asked me if I knew whether M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney had arrived— I did not—but
							perceiving the drift of the question, I told him, that I understood
							Rodney was to be his competitor to-morrow. He said he had just now for
							the first time been so informed: and that he understood M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney was the candidate favoured at
							Washington. I said that if by Washington he meant the Administration of
							the General Government, so far as I was personally concerned in it, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney was not my favoured Candidate— As
							far as I had a right to any preference it had been in his favour;
							because he had been the Speaker before; and because a question of
							re-election was different from a question of election for the first
							time. I added that in consequence of our conversation when he had called
							upon me the other day, I had expressed these Sentiments to the
							President; but had been assured by him, that he had taken and should
							take no part whatever in the election— Considering it on principle
							improper, for the Executive to interfere in the choice of a Speaker of
							the house— He said he approved of the principle, but that the members
							who could be influenced by such motives would be told that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney was the person, the choice of whom
							would be acceptable to the administration, while others would be excited
							against him, Taylor, on pretence that he was a Clintonian— I said I was
							apprehensive, that if there should be a strong opposition to him it
							would arise chiefly from his own State; and its delegation. He said they
							would be about equally divided. He had been called falsely a Clintonian—
							He had for the last three years had no personal intercourse with
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clinton</persRef>— He had been no partizan because between the two
							divisions of the Republican party he had seen no difference of
							principle. He had until his last election been supported by all the
							Republicans of his District, without reference to State parties; last
							Spring there had been a buck-tail caucus in his District, who had agreed
							to nominate him <pb type="ms" n="163"/>together with an Assembly ticket
							of their own— But the Clintonians, being quicker than their adversaries,
							had a meeting and actually nominated him, with <hi rend="italic"
								>their</hi> Assembly ticket; upon which the other party got up an
							opponent to him; a <persRef ref="vanschoonhoven-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Schoonhoven</persRef>, who had
							through the whole of the War, and until very lately had been a
							federalist, but had now become a republican— I said there had been an
							impression that in his appointment of Committees last year, he had
							manifested unfriendliness to the administration— I had no complaint of
							that sort to make, myself; but other Departments perhaps had. He
							declared he had never appointed a Committee or a Chairman with any such
							feeling— That the Committees of the second Session of every Congress
							were usually the same as those of the first Session— He had found them
							all, appointed by his <persRef key="clay-henry">Predecessor</persRef>—
							The Chairman of the Naval Committee had indeed been changed— <persRef
								ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef> the former chairman could not be appointed,
							because he was not here at the commencement of the Session when the
							standing Committees were appointed— <persRef ref="barbour-philip">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef>, the chairman
							appointed in Silsbee’s stead, had indeed views in relation to the navy,
							which he Taylor did not approve, but he had not known them when he
							appointed him, and the whole Committee was so far from countenancing
							him, that Barbour had complained that he had given him a Committee with
							which he could do nothing— And in fact the Committee would not report
							Barbour’s project; but he was obliged to bring it forward in his own
							name— Of the military Committee he gave an account equally direct to
							disprove any hostile feeling on his part to the Administration; and he
							said he had been much surprized at the first intimation that such a
							Sentiment was entertained— As to his personal feelings towards M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, they had been indicated in the
							year 1816. by the part in his favour which he had taken when the contest
							was between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— At that time certain Resolutions had been passed
							by the Republican members of the New-York Legislature at Albany, under
							the influence, and at the instigation of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Beuren</persRef>; which he
							happened to have in his trunk, and would read to me; which he did— They
							were most earnest Resolutions against the election of another Virginian
							President, and a recommendation equally earnest of <persRef
								ref="tompkins-daniel">D. D. Tompkins</persRef> for that high Office—
							Taylor said he had declined supporting these opinions, and had written
							in answer to the Resolutions that with all possible respect for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tompkins’s character and services, it was
							impossible to present him as a Candidate for the Presidency with any
							chance of success— And he had been told that when this his answer had
							been made known to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tompkins, he had said
							it was because Taylor himself did not wish for his success— He then
							repeated the account which he had given me last year of what he had
							understood as a promise from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe of
							the appointment of District judge for the Northern District of New-York,
							and of his disappointment, when without any notice to him as had been
							promised, and a few days before the Session commenced, <persRef
								ref="skinner-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Skinner</persRef>
							had been appointed— He had been told that the Vice President, and the
							Secretary of the Navy had made interest against him— But <persRef
								ref="vanness-john">General Van Ness</persRef> had assured him that
							the President had told him there had been no opposition to Taylor
							through them. I said, I knew not what had been the President’s
							determining motive; other than as he had said to me it was because
							Skinner had been the District Attorney, and it was in the usual routine
							of promotion. Taylor said it was now past, and he thought no more about
							it— Taylor told me he doubted whether the Vice-President would be here
							this Winter— I said I thought he could not avoid coming— He said he had
							thought so too. But a friend of the Vice President’s had told him he
							thought he would not come— It would at first be said he would be here
							after the Holidays— Then he would be said to be in ill health, and
							perhaps as there was last year a certificate from Surgeons will be
							procured declaring that the state of his health, will not admit of his
							coming—this will last till about April, and then the <pb type="ms"
								n="164"/>Session being so near its close, for a very few days it
							will not be worth while to come— He says there is nothing for him to do
							here, and any other man may preside in the Senate as well as he— From
							Taylor’s I went and called upon <persRef ref="trimble-william">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Trimble</persRef> a Senator from
							Ohio, at <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Peyton’s</persRef>— Met <persRef ref="stokes-montfort"
								>Stokes</persRef>, Senator from North-Carolina, on the Avenue—just
							arrived— Trimble is exceedingly ill, confined to his chamber, and
							looking as if he would not long survive— While I was with him, his
							namesake, <persRef ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef> of Kentucky
							came in— After returning home I went to the Office, having directed the
							Messenger, when he came with the daily mail to order the watchman to
							open the door, and I searched for the papers for which the President had
							sent this Morning, but found only one Letter of <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin’s</persRef>— I wrote a Note, and
							sent it by the Messenger to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>, requesting him to
							send the papers to the President early to-morrow Morning— I took the
							Letter that I had found to the President, who requested me to meet with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson at his house at 11 to morrow Morning. While we were
							at dinner, <persRef ref="taylor-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Taylor</persRef> came, requesting that his commission as
							Consular commercial Agent might be transferred from Carthagena to Vera
							Cruz. I promised to speak about it to the President to-morrow. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent called in the Evening, and told me
							that he had found at the Office, and taken to the President a part of
							the papers wanted by him; the other part were locked up in the desk of
								<persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.
								Forrest</persRef> who had them to copy, and he was not at home; but
							they would be sent to the President early to-morrow Morning— I received
							two Notes from <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef>; one, merely asking for an
							interview—the other a long one upon rolled and hammered iron.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI:30.</date> The Door Keeper of the house of Representatives
								<persRef ref="claxton-thomas">Joseph Claxton</persRef>, died
							yesterday, and this morning <persRef ref="dougherty-thomas"
								>Dougherty</persRef> came to ask me to befriend him, if any of the
							members of the house should call upon me, recommending him for the
							place— <persRef ref="maul-william">Maul</persRef>, a son of the <persRef
								ref="maul-john">former Messenger of the Department</persRef> and
							who has been a Captain in the Army, came to the Office, to solicit
							influence for the same appointment. At eleven O’Clock I attended at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, where I found
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Thompson</persRef>— The question upon the paragraph of the Message
							relating to the altercation between <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef>, and judge <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef> at Pensacola, was
							submitted. I had suggested that after the papers received on Saturday,
							the paragraph in the Message which gave them both equal credit for
							integrity of motive and intention, could not be sustained— I now
							observed that it put them both upon a level, which I thought could not
							with justice be done— Their conduct was widely different, with reference
							both to morals and political principle. Jackson even if he had erred,
							had only supported with an excess of energy the cause of Justice and
							Humanity— Fromentin whatever his motives were, supported by his
							interference the cause of fraud and perfidy. Jackson had never for a
							moment doubted his own right to act as he did— Fromentin’s course had
							been weak, inconsistent, wavering and full of prevarication— Judge
							Thompson said he had not been present at the former Meetings on these
							subjects and had not read the former papers. But he had hitherto
							considered their conduct as standing upon the same grounds— That
							Fromentin had mistaken his powers in issuing the writ of Habeas Corpus,
							and Jackson his in summoning Fromentin before him. But that their
							motives had been equally upright. I read several passages, from
							Fromentin’s own Letters, to shew the unsteadiness, and shifting
							character of his own Statements; for all of which however M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thompson successively found apologies.
							The President read three several drafts of paragraphs to be substituted
							for that which had first been prepared—and a question arose whether it
							would not be best to say nothing of Fromentin— It was agreed that the
							Message in regard to Fromentin should be shaped according to the
							previous determination of the President whether he would or would not
							re-nominate him to the Senate for the permanent appointment of judge— I
							said that I had fully made up my mind that he ought not to be
							re-nominated. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun said if he should
							not be nominated the public opinion would universally be that it was
							because he had issued the writ of Habeas-Corpus— It would have the
							appearance of taking the side of General Jackson upon that point, which
							he thought <pb type="ms" n="165"/>would injure the reputation of the
							Government: If he should not be nominated it would be absolutely
							necessary to bring the whole correspondence both of Jackson and
							Fromentin before the public; to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun said he had the most extreme aversion— He thought therefore that
							the President should nominate Fromentin, and then send <hi rend="italic"
								>confidentially</hi>, the whole correspondence to the Senate; that
							if they saw fit, they might reject him. Calhoun seemed to have an
							absolute horror, at the idea of the publication of the Correspondence. I
							said that in the first place, I did not believe it would be possible to
							suppress the Correspondence. Probably not a week would pass over, before
							there would be a Call from the House of Representatives for documents
							relative to the Habeas Corpus affair, and then they must all come out.
							And secondly, it would not be consistent with the Spirit of our
							Constitution that the President should nominate to the Senate in the
							expectation that they will reject him, a man whom the President would
							not appoint, if the absolute appointment were in himself. I knew of no
							possible case in which it would be right for the President to nominate a
							man, intending him to be rejected. If the case be clear, against the
							man, he ought on no account to be nominated—if doubtful the President
							ought not to throw upon the Senate the responsibility of rejecting which
							he would decline to assume himself. Calhoun disputed the
							principle—distinguished between a new appointment and a
							re-appointment—thought the Spirit of the permanent tenure of judicial
							office, made a nomination after a temporary appointment almost
							compulsory— He spoke of the general spirit of Constitution as leaning
							towards the opinion of referring appointments to the decision of
							numerous bodies of men— I thought this altogether unsound political
							doctrine; and referred to an expression of opinion lately published in a
							Letter of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> of the great danger arising from the permanent
							tenure of judicial offices. Calhoun said he thought himself that judges
							ought in certain cases to be removable otherwise than by impeachment.
							But while the Constitution remains as it is, he would execute it, in its
							Spirit— I said the necessity of renomination was as much in the Spirit
							of the Constitution, as the permanent tenure of judicial office; and if
							it afforded even a partial remedy for the danger of indefeasible office
							it should rather be cherished than counteracted— Judge Thompson gave no
							opinion upon this question of renomination; and the President said he
							would keep it open; desiring more information before he should decide—
							No positive preference was declared, for either of the paragraphs
							prepared as substitutes for that which is to be altered; but from the
							discussion the President will form his own determination. At the
							suggestion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson he had also
							prepared a paragraph to close the Message with a Sentiment of religious
							gratitude; a Sentiment perfectly proper in itself, and which I too
							strongly approved to object against it— But I did not earnestly
							recommend it, precisely because the motive alledged for it, was its
							expediency or effect upon the public opinion— The President said he
							usually had introduced such a passage, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson thought the Message would in the opinions of many
							persons be thought exceptionable without it— There was something said
							about the prospects of War between Russia and Turkey in Europe, and
							something about the recent Revolution in Mexico— Upon both these
							incidents in the History of these times, I thought our information too
							scanty and too much derived from Newspapers to require or authorize any
							thing to be said in the Message concerning them— After Calhoun and
							Thompson had withdrawn, I told the President the substance of the
							Conversation, which I had yesterday with <persRef ref="taylor-john">J.
								W. Taylor</persRef>, and of my assurance to him that the President
							would not in any manner interfere with the election of Speaker— I told
							him that Taylor had declared his approbation of the principle; but said
							the argument would undoubtedly be used to influence votes, that another
							member would be more acceptable, to the administration: and I said there
							certainly had been some Executive influence exercised, for a deputation
							of New-York members, had been in concert with judge Thompson, and agreed
							to <pb type="ms" n="166"/>vote not only against Taylor, but for <persRef
								ref="rodney-caesar">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney</persRef>.
							The President said he had never had a single word upon the subject. He
							had no doubt there was something of the New-York politics in it— He said
							they had strictly enjoined upon <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef> to say nothing about it, though they were both
							independent of him— He had spoken upon the subject only with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun. The President also shewed me the
							Papers which he had mentioned to me, last Friday— They were a Letter
							from <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="livingston-robert">Livingston</persRef> dated 22. March 1803.
							most explicitly declaring that the first Consul was determined to keep
							and to colonize Louisiana; with a sophistical argument, a grave
							persiflage to shew that it would tend to promote harmony, and
							good-understanding with the United States—a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe; dated 10. April 1803. addressed to him at Havre,
							after his arrival there from America; and he says not received till
							after he reached Paris— In this Letter Livingston speaks with the utmost
							despondency of the chances of the Negotiation, and laments that <persRef
								ref="ross-james">Ross’s</persRef> Resolutions had not passed— Lastly
							minutes of the Journal of <persRef ref="mercer-john">John
								Mercer</persRef> who was with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							as his Secretary— The minutes commence with their arrival at Havre; and
							continue till after their arrival at Paris which was on the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April— That Evening M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe spent with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Livingston; Mercer was present and kept minutes of what was
							said by Livingston— It was in the same desponding style, and the same
							regret that Ross’s Resolutions had not passed as in the Letter. Now the
							pretence in <persRef ref="armstrong-john">Armstrong’s</persRef>
							publication is that on this very 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							April, the proposal for the sale of all Louisiana had already been
							proposed by Talleyrand to Livingston; and the dilemma upon the
							reputation of Livingston is, of having dissembled with his Colleague,
							and withheld from him the knowledge of the change in the determination
							of the French Government, and of his conversation of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April with Talleyrand; or of
							disingenuously attempting to shew that the whole business was transacted
							in substance before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe arrived— This
							is Armstrong’s argument, and as the cunning of Ambition deals more in
							equivocations concealments and evasions than in direct forgeries and
							falsehood’s, the conclusion I have drawn from the counter-statements on
							both sides is that the determination of the French Government to sell
							was taken before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s arrival at
							Paris— That there was a conversation between Talleyrand, and Livingston
							concerning it on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April, which
							Livingston reported to the <persRef ref="madison-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef> but not to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe—
							His motive for withholding it, and for continuing to represent the
							chances of success as desperate when he had on the same day written to
							the Secretary of State that the Resolution to sell, had been taken in
							the Council on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> cannot be classed
							among the magnanimous impulses to action— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe disclaims all pretension of having had any agency in producing
							the determination of the French Government, but he charges Livingston
							with unfair dealing in pursuit of the object of engrossing to himself
							the whole merit of the Louisiana purchase. At the Office, there came
							successively as visitors, <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef> the Russian
							Minister, with <persRef ref="maltitz-friedrich">Baron de
								Maltitz</persRef> his new Secretary of Legation. Poletica has just
							returned to the City. He told me that he had a number of papers to
							communicate to me, some day when I should be at leisure—among the rest a
							summary of the recent negotiation between his Government and the Porte.
							He said the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> was
							not pleased at the interference of others, in this negotiation, and
							there was especially a demand of the Porte that Russia should deliver up
							certain fugitives to which it was impossible the Emperor should ever
							agree. He said I should also see among the papers a Note from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, expressing
							every sentiment which was contained in the Laybach circular, and against
							which the British Government afterwards protested— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica likewise assured me that he had
							no agency in the recent publication in the Newspapers of the Emperor
							Alexander’s <pb type="ms" n="167"/>rescript, honorary to himself; he had
							not received the original till his return here; the translation in the
							Newspapers had been published by <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis</persRef>, and was not correct—
							It was due as delicacy from him to this Government to mention this fact—
								<persRef ref="shaler-william">Shaler</persRef> came to speak about
							the settlement of his accounts— I told him I had not yet been able to
							examine all the items of his extraordinary claims; but mentioned the
							objections of the Secretary of the Navy to the whole charge for acting
							as judge Advocate on the Court of Enquiry— After some discussion he said
							he should acquiesce in any allowance which the Government would think
							proper, presuming they would at least refund what he had paid. I told
							him yes, and the addition of ten dollars a day for his attendance—
								<persRef ref="taylor-william">William Taylor</persRef> came to ask
							what was the decision, upon his application to have the promise of
							exchanging the commercial agency of Carthagena, for that of Vera-Cruz— I
							had forgotten to mention it to the President, and went over to him again
							about it— He thought an appointment at Vera-Cruz now would be premature.
							He desired me to tell Taylor that his disposition towards him was
							altogether friendly; and that if the time for the appointment at Vera
							Cruz, should come before he goes for Carthagena, his claims for the
							Office will be considered. I told him so accordingly, and he took leave
							of me saying he was satisfied— I took to the President’s several papers
							of remonstrance against the re-appointment of the <persRef
								ref="morrell-john">Marshal of Georgia, Morel,</persRef> among the
							rest a Letter signed by the <persRef ref="clarke-john2"
								>Governor</persRef>, President of the Senate and Speaker of the
							House of Georgia, recommending <persRef ref="triplett-unknown">Major
								Triplett</persRef> not only as a suitable Successor, but successful
							competitor to <unclear>. . .</unclear>— I wrote a short Note to <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef>, informing him of the instructions to the Officers
							to restore the pirated Newfoundland vessel, subject to Salvage; and to
								<persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>
							informing him of the order for restoring the Norwegian vessel Perlan—
							This day commenced the first Session of the 17<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress— There was a Quorum formed of both Houses— There
							were seven Ballots for a Speaker in the House of Representatives,
							without effecting a choice. About 60 votes for Taylor— Upwards of 100
							against him— Running for Rodney, <persRef ref="mclane-louis"

						<p><date>4. IV:15.</date> A Man by the name of <persRef
								ref="mcdowell-unknown">M’Dowell</persRef> came this morning to
							solicit influence to obtain the Office of assistant door-keeper to the
							House of Representatives in Congress— This poor man was the third; and
							had the best claim of the three; for he had lost an arm in the late War—
							I called on <persRef ref="meigs-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Josiah Meigs</persRef>, Superintendent of the Land Office, and told
							him what I knew of <persRef ref="bourne-george">G. S. Bourne’s</persRef>
							pretensions to an appointment, in that Office— He said the vacancy, was
							of an able Draftsman; and such a one they wanted. <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> whom I had appointed to meet at one O’Clock, came
							and was with me nearly three hours, conversing on a great variety of
							Subjects in a manner entirely desultory.— His first object was to
							explain to me how two American Vessels seized on the borders of the
							Province of New-Brunswick for smuggling, and which he, upon an
							application from this Government, for indulgence had recommended to the
								<persRef ref="smyth-george">Governors of New-Brunswick</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="kempt-james">Nova-Scotia</persRef> for it, had been
							condemned and sold— I also read to him the papers transmitted to this
							Government, concerning the Caroline, a vessel tried likewise, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Andrews in New Brunswick, and those
							relating to the Fame, a vessel on trial in our own Courts— All these
							cases turn upon the question of the bordering line between Moose-Island,
							and Campo Bello. The question of transcending the proper territorial
							jurisdiction, to execute revenue Laws was also involved in them— Upon
							the identity or similitude of rolled and hammered iron, there was also
							much said— He insists they are the same—and I know not how to prove the
							contrary. I promised him to look into the subject and answer his Notes;
							and said if upon examination, it should be found practicable, the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would recommend it
							by a message, to Congress— Of the Newfoundland Pirates; M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning seemed not entirely satisfied with
							the order to restore the vessel and Cargo <pb type="ms" n="168"/>subject
							to the claim of Salvage for the Officers of the Customs— He said he had
							understood Salvage was granted only in cases of wrecks, or of recaptures
							at Sea. I told him the claim and its amount would both be subject to the
							decision of the Court— They were private and individual rights which the
							Government could not of right release— On the case of Carleton Island;
							he asked a number of questions in relation to the possession and the
							time when it had been taken by us. I told him the Circumstances as they
							were known to us— He seemed anxious to find some apology for the seizure
							from Kingston— I told him our complaint was of the disturbance by force
							of the actual state of things, while the negotiation was pending; and
							that the <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor of New-York</persRef>
							had positively proposed a battle; if there should come another excursion
							from Kingston. But that the President had cooled his martial ardour for
							the present— He said it was no doubt a process against smugglers. I said
							if they meant to recover possession under the Treaty, they should have
							demanded it, as we had done in the case of the Post at the mouth of
							Columbia river— He said that in that case <persRef key="bagot-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> had complained
							that we despatched the ship, without giving notice— And yet, I said we
							had made the formal demand of restoration more than two years before— We
							have therefore a much stronger cause of complaint than could be alledged
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot— He spoke about the Slave-trade,
							and asked me, if I had seen a Letter from <persRef ref="collier-george"
								>Sir George Collier</persRef> recently published in the Newspapers—
							I had; but made no remark upon it. He asked if we had any cruizer upon
							the African Coast now— I said the same <persRef ref="stockton-robert"
									>Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Stockton</persRef>, who had
							captured the four French Schooners. He asked if we could not so
							accommodate our naval arrangements as to increase our force there— I
							said I could not exactly say—but our force was sufficient to banish our
							flag from the whole Coast— There had not been found for these two years
							a single Slave-trader wearing the American flag— I asked him if he
							recollected the hint I had given him last Spring to propose to his
							Government, to advise their ally the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of
								Denmark</persRef>, to look a little to what was going on at his
							Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas— He said certainly and
							he had availed himself of it. I said I had seen in our newspapers,
							within these two days, a notice from Copenhagen, that the late Governor
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas, <persRef ref="bentzon-adrian"
								>Bentzon</persRef>, had been convicted of Slave-trade participation
							and sentenced to pay a heavy fine. Canning said it might very probably
							be the result of our former conversation— I told him we had almost got
							into a quarrel with France about these captures of Lieutenant Stockton—
							The French authorities in the West Indies, and the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef> here were all
							on fire about the outrage upon the French flag, and they had sent me
							volumes of testimony given by the Slave-traders themselves, to prove
							Lieutenant Stockton was a Pirate— Not only so but the French Minister,
							with a lofty tone maintained that these vessels were engaged in lawful
							trade—greatly injured persons— Three of the four vessels were recaptured
							upon their prize crews— Two of them went back, not to Guadeloupe, but to
							French Guyana, and there trumped up this story of interruption of their
							lawful trade, by the Pirate Stockton. The third is brought into Boston,
							and the French Minister peremptorily demands that she should be
							delivered up to the <persRef ref="devalnais-joseph">French
								Consul</persRef>, or to her owners—and in one of his Notes to me,
							says “le sort du quatriéme n’est pas encore connu”— I had told the Baron
							de Neuville, that I could inform him what that <hi rend="italic"
								>Sort</hi> was— She returned to the coast of Africa; took in her
							pre-engaged Cargo of 150 Slaves, and carried them and landed them in the
							face of day at Guadeloupe, with <persRef ref="inman-william">Lieutenant
								Inman</persRef> and the prize crew from whom the vessel had been
							recaptured all the time on board— Canning said he hoped these facts
							would be made known to the world. I assured him that indeed they should—
							He said that De Neuville himself professed to be <pb type="ms" n="169"
							/>very earnest for the suppression of the Slave-trade, but he was
							against allowing the right of search— Yet he admitted that it was the
							most effectual means that could be adopted for the suppression, and he,
							Canning, thought we should ultimately be convinced of the necessity of
							coming into it— I said that was impossible— There were objections of the
							most serious nature against the thing itself, in any shape; but unless
							Britain would bind herself by an Article as strong and explicit as
							language can make it, never again in time of War, to take a man, from an
							American vessel, we never for a moment could listen to a proposal for
							allowing a right of search in time of peace— He asked me in a
							half-bantering tone whether I had not intended last winter to make some
							such proposal to him— I told him no. We had exhausted Negotiation in
							endeavouring to make an arrangement with Great-Britain, on the subject
							of impressment— We had failed, and were not desirous of obtaining the
							object by indirect means— The proposal must come from them, if they were
							prepared for it— We merely refused to admit a right of search in time of
							peace. On this principle too we should give up the French vessel at
							Boston, at the demand of the French Minister, at least the Executive had
							so advised the Circuit Court— There has been a trial before that
							Court—but the main question was whether there was, any of our Citizens
							interested in the Slave-vessel; of that there was no evidence except the
							very slight presumption arising from the fact that she had been built in
							the United States— He asked me, if at the time of our former discussions
							I had not seen the decision of <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir William
								Scott</persRef> in the case of the Lewis. I told him no— I had not
							seen it until the case of this French vessel had arisen— He was
							surprized at this, and said he regretted not having communicated it to
							me— I asked him what was the passage of <persRef
								ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef> to which he had
							referred on the application to deliver up the Newfoundland Pirates— He
							said it would be found in the Index, tunder the title of Habeas Corpus.
							We examined both <persRef ref="tucker-stgeorge">Tuckers</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="christian-unknown">Christian’s</persRef> Blackstone,
							but did not find it. He said he would send me a minute of it— We
							discussed the whole subject over again, and he dwelt much upon the
							actual delivery of the men charged with murder and forgery, by the
								<persRef ref="dalhousie-george">Governor of Canada</persRef>, to the
							Governors of New-York and <persRef ref="skinner-richard"
								>Vermont</persRef>— I told him that might give a claim to
							reciprocity from the Governors of those two States— It was at <hi
								rend="italic">their</hi> demand, and not that of the United States,
							that the men were delivered up— A Similar demand might be made of those
							two Governors— Perhaps they might possess the authority—as bordering
							States they were more interested than others in the exercise of it. It
							was the power to deliver up, which was considered as wanting to the
							President— We had also much talk upon European affairs—Russia, Turkey
							and Greece. I told him I still thought as I had heretofore that England
							would not permit Russia to go to War— It was apparent that she was
							effectually interposing to prevent it; but how they would let off the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> without
							humiliating him seemed likely to make a difficulty; and after <persRef
								ref="stroganoff-unknown">Strogonoff’s</persRef> open breaking up at
							Constantinople, the Emperor could hardly recede without humiliation—
							Canning said he had been long at Constantinople himself, and knew how
							the Russian diplomatic men treated habitually the Turkish Government,
							which was by no means courteously— They were much accustomed to threaten
							them; and hard words did not carry the consequence there which they did
							elsewhere. He asked what part France appeared to take in this turmoil. I
							said it was apparent that France did not lead; and as she had heretofore
							been very much accustomed to lead, she might probably now not be
							disposed to follow the lead of others. All the Turkish Notes were said
							to be written by <persRef ref="smythe-percy">Lord Strangford</persRef>—
							Austria was said also to take part with the Turks— But of the French
							Mission at Constantinople, not a word was said— At the close of this
							Conversation Canning told me that he had left despatches at home
							unopened, which came by the Packet— It appeared to <pb type="ms" n="170"
							/>me that he came for the purpose of gathering materials for a despatch—
							He kept up his habitual reserve and caution in withholding all opinions
							of his own; and pursued as usual with great earnestness the discovery of
							my opinions— I took to the President’s a remonstrance against the
							appointment of <persRef ref="ware-asher">Ashur Ware</persRef>, as
							District judge of the United States, in the State of Maine, which I had
							received together with a Letter from <persRef ref="wingate-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joshua Wingate</persRef>— The
							President told me that the House of Representatives had chosen <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip P.
								Barbour</persRef> of Virginia their Speaker— He was a new candidate,
							started this morning, and came in at the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> ballot by a vote of 88 upon 173— I asked the President
							what papers should be sent to Congress; and he concluded to send with
							the Message only those relating to the taking possession of Florida—
							This Evening, <persRef ref="little-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter Little</persRef>, a member from Maryland, and <persRef

								>Tomlinson</persRef>, <persRef ref="barber-noyes">Barber</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="sterling-ansel">Sterling</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stoddard-ebenezer">Stoddard</persRef> members of Congress from
							Connecticut, and <persRef ref="johnson-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis Johnson</persRef>, a member from Kentucky. His
							object was to have the printing of the Laws, restored to a Newspaper at
							Russelville, instead of the paper at Louisville, to which it was
							transferred, at the last Session of Congress— I told him I should wish
							to consult <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> at whose solicitation it was
							transferred last year. He said that he would ask Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. to write me a Note, or to call upon
							me concerning it— He said the People in his District took more interest
							in the matter than he had thought they would, and as the Russelville
							paper had been against him, if the printing should not be restored to
							it, they would attribute it to him. I also received an application from
							fourteen members of the Pennsylvania delegation in the House and the
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Senator W. Lowrie</persRef> requesting
							me to appoint the Franklin Gazette to print the Laws instead of the
							Democratic Press in which it has been done for several years— A Similar
							request was made the last year, but the appointment had been made out
							before I received it, and <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roberts</persRef> one of the then
							Senators took a strong interest in favour of <persRef ref="binns-john"
								>Binns</persRef> the Editor of the Press— I told him however that in
							designating the Newspapers for printing the Laws, it had <pb type="ms"
								n="171"/>been usual, and was entirely proper to consult the Members
							of Congress from the several States, and always to appoint those in
							whose favour the delegation were agreed— If therefore at the present
							Session the Delegation or so large a majority of them should renew the
							application for I change I should feel myself obliged to make it,
							although I had no complaint against Binns for any deficiency in the
							discharge of the duty heretofore. I now took the present application to
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and asked his
							advice, which was to comply with it, which I shall do, not without
							reluctance; for it is another instance of the ebullitions of internal
							State Politics overflowing upon the Government of the Union. Another
							affair upon which I spoke to the President was a new list furnished by
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, the Russian Minister, of persons attached to his
							Legation, in which he has included <persRef ref="ivanoff-theodore">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ivanoff</persRef> the Russian Consul
							General residing at Philadelphia— He had some time since mentioned to me
							his wish to do this, which I had not encouraged— His object is to obtain
							diplomatic privileges and exemptions for the Consul General of his
							Nation. The President said he thought it would be dangerous to allow
							them, as it would form a Precedent, of which the French and British
							Ministers might with the more shew of reason avail themselves, inasmuch
							as the Consuls General of both those Nations actually reside at
							Washington. He desired me to see Poletica, and assuring him of our
							disposition to accommodate as far as was in our power the views of the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, to state the necessary
							objections to the admission of the Consul-General to Diplomatic
							privileges— I left with the President, a Letter from <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, to me, representing
							certain inconveniences, attached to the character of Charge d’Affaires
							at the Court of the Netherlands; a case for which I am afraid there is
							for the present no remedy; and a Letter from <persRef
								ref="fairchild-robert">R. Fairchild</persRef>, Marshal of the
							District of Connecticut, whose Commission is about to expire, and who
							declines a re-appointment. I wrote short despatches to <persRef

						<p><date>7. VII:30.</date> Sunrise— Three hours too late— Morning visits
							from <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickinson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dwight</persRef>, a new member from
							Massachusetts— <persRef ref="campbell-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John W. Campbell</persRef>, a member from the State of
							Ohio, called to make enquiries concerning the Accounts of <persRef
								ref="hamm-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamm</persRef>,
							Marshal of Ohio, for taking the Census; and also concerning the charges
							heretofore made against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamm— I told him
							that the charges had been made directly to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and not through the
							Department of State— The President had examined into them but had not
							found them substantiated so far as to authorise his removal— He said he
							wished to ascertain whether the charges existing against him were
							founded or not— If they were, he should be averse to his re-appointment,
							as his term of service is about to expire— If they were not, he should
							be entirely satisfied with the D<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							reappointment— But he had some reasons for suspecting, that one or more
							of his Assistants had not received the whole sum, which had been charged
							and allowed in the settlement of his Account for the services of that
							same assistant. He had reason to believe that he had in various cases,
							endeavoured to obtain written engagements from Assistants to take their
							portions of the census for less than the law allowed, and had taken to
							himself the balance— If this had been done extensively he might have
							made four or five thousand dollars by it, though he conceived the
							Marshal could be entitled to no more than the 300 dollars expressly
							allowed him by the Law— And he was the more induced to this enquiry
							because at the last Session of Congress, <persRef
								ref="woodbridge-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbridge</persRef>, then a Delegate in Congress from the Michigan
							Territory had told him that <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor
								Cass</persRef> had laid the foundation of a handsome Fortune, by
							taking the Census of 1810. and upon his enquiring how this could be upon
							an allowance of two hundred dollars, Woodbridge had said perhaps he had
							been mistaken— I told him that the accounts of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hamm as they had been <pb type="ms" n="172"/>settled were at
							the State or Treasury Department where he could have free access to
							them. He could there see what sum had been allowed for each and every
							assistant, and he could ascertain from any of the assistants themselves
							what they had received— If it should turn out that the Marshal had not
							paid over to every Assistant the whole sum that he had charged for him
							he must abide by the consequences; but were it so, I must further say in
							his behalf that he would not be alone in the opinion that some deduction
							from the pay of the Assistants ought to be made, for the benefit of the
							Marshal— Many of the Marshals, apparently without concert with one
							another had been of that opinion, and had advanced the clause— They had
							alledged much trouble and some expence in the necessary correspondence,
							with their assistants, and especially the heavy charge of Postage, of
							which I had used every exertion to relieve them, but without success. I
							added that they almost universally and I thought justly complained of
							the inadequateness of the compensation— To this M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Campbell agreed— But he thought it could not by any means
							warrant the Marshal in shaving the compensation of his Assistants— He
							spoke also of the returns of the Assistants and said he had made a
							motion in the house yesterday for a Committee to bring in a Bill for
							apportioning anew the Representation— I told him there was yet a
							deficiency of the return for one district of <persRef
								ref="waring-morton">South Carolina, which the Marshal</persRef>
							informed me could probably not come in before the first of January; and
							that although the rest was all printed and in two or three days would be
							ready to be delivered, I had hesitated whether to send it in until the
							last return should be received— He thought it would be best to send them
							in as they now are as it would be easy to act upon an estimate of the
							deficient district— He said the Legislature of Ohio were now in Session,
							and if a Bill should speedily pass for the apportionment, they might
							divide the State into Districts during their present Session; but if it
							should be long delayed they might be obliged to meet in the Summer— I
							told him I would send in the returns in the course of the next week. At
							the Office, I had visits from <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="nelson-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nelson</persRef> of Massachusetts— Nelson wished to ascertain the
							time, when the French took possession of the Spanish part of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Domingo. He spoke also of the State of
							our commercial affairs, and asked if it was thought best to persevere in
							the system we have hitherto pursued, or to depart from it— I said the
							President’s opinion was decidedly for persevering in it. I told him the
							prospect there was of a change in England, and the actual state of our
							Negotiation with France— He appeared well disposed himself to persevere,
							and said that as to France, our Exports to her now were greater than
							they had been before our last tonnage act, and a much greater proportion
							of them in our own vessels— Fuller said something about the election of
							Speaker, which has disappointed almost every body, but has turned out
							entirely to the satisfaction of Virginia— <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>M’Lane</persRef> of Delaware it is said was set up by

							the Senator, who was cautious of committing his own opinions, but did
							not entirely agree with his representative. There will be much wrangling
							in Congress on this conflict between the federal and state authorities,
							with no good effect; but to the revival of faction in all its

								<persRef ref="eustis-william;eustis-caroline" type="multi">M<hi

							some conversation, upon the ratio of representation, to be fixed under
							this Census— He entertains the generally prevailing opinion, that the
							numbers of Constituents to elect one representative should be increased,
							so that the numbers of the House should remain much as they are at
							present—or very little increased— My own opinion is different, and I
							think the considerations in favour of retaining the present ratio, and
							increasing the numbers of the house preponderate over those in support
							of the opposite course— I shall probably be almost alone of this

							of Pennsylvania who came to enquire concerning the appointment of
							Printers of the Laws in Philadelphia. I told them that I should comply
							with the request which I had received from so large a portion of the
							delegation of the State, though I must acknowledge to them, it would be
							not entirely without reluctance— In the annual appointment of Printers
							of the Laws, one rule which I had always observed was to reappoint the
							Printers of the preceding Session, in every case where there is no <pb
								type="ms" n="175"/>no special reason for a change. The Democratic
							Press, had been one of the Papers, appointed for the publication of the
							Laws, before, I came into the Department of State— Whatever the Merits
							or demerits of its Editor have been with regard to the internal politics
							of the State, he had given no cause of complaint, either with regard to
							the printing of the Laws, or to the general Government, on any other
							grounds— But it was obviously proper, that the wishes of the delegation
							from each State, should be considered and have due weight in designating
							these appointments, and as so large a proportion of the Pennsylvania
							delegation for two successive years, had united in the application for a
							change, I should not feel myself justified in withstanding their wish,
							and should appoint the Franklin Gazette, for the publication of the Laws
							of the present Session. Rogers said the Franklin Gazette was the paper
							which had the most extensive circulation throughout the State; that
							although the application to me was signed only by 14. members of the
							House of Representatives, from the State, he had given notice to all the
							other members, and not one of them would interfere, or have a wish in
							favour of <persRef ref="binns-john">Binns</persRef>; the only Senator
							from Pennsylvania now here, had signed the paper; and the other Senator,
							who would be here in a few days, would assuredly have no objection to
							the change— I replied, that I presumed he would feel no partiality for
							Binns— He meant the late <persRef ref="findlay-william">Governor
								Findlay</persRef>, who will undoubtedly come as the second
							Pennsylvania Senator, although the election is only to be made this day—
							Binns and his papers have been the principal agent and instrument of the

							precisely the cause of the resentments which now urge for the
							appointment of another printer— <persRef ref="halkett-john">A M<hi

								<persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomews, mentioning objections made
							by this same M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nörderling, to recognizing

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> and judge
								<persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef> concerning the
							late transactions at Pensacola— I took all these papers over to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and again
							strenuously urged him not to nominate Judge Fromentin, to the Senate as
							the judge under the new territorial Government— The President said the
							nomination could not be made till the Act for reorganizing the
							Territorial Government should have passed, which would certainly not be,
							within two Months; and he again manifested a strong desire for the
							suppression of all these documents; the Letters both of General Jackson
							and of judge Fromentin. I told him I thought it would be impossible— And
							I said that upon the whole review of Fromentin’s conduct I thought,
							without imputing corrupt motives to him, that it proved him incompetent
							on the score even of Law knowledge, to hold the Office of judge of the
							United States; and I detailed the particulars of his conduct, and the
							weakness of his arguments in defence of it, upon which I had <pb

							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norderling to thanks from the U.S. and
							his objections to the reception of R. M. Harrison, as Consul— I supposed
							one of these things might be made to help the other— To be attended to

							named <persRef ref="zaeb-unknown">Zaeb</persRef>, who has been four
							years on a visit to <persRef ref="zaeb-unknown2">his brother</persRef>,
							living in Alexandria, and now wishes to return home— I gave him a
							Certificate on his passport; but could not furnish him the statistical
							Reports on Manufactures which he wanted— <persRef ref="dickinson-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickinson</persRef>, of
							New-York, renewed an Application in behalf of <persRef
								ref="davis-charles2">Charles A. Davis</persRef>, for a consular
							appointment, which he had already made last year. He expects an early
							vacancy at the Havanna; and I recommended to him to advise M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis to make a new written application
							and to forward as many, and as respectable recommendations as he could
							obtain— Dickinson spoke also to me concerning the choice of a Speaker—
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> and their friends prevented
							the election of <persRef ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef>. But the
							Southern men would not vote for <persRef ref="rodney-caesar"
								>Rodney</persRef>; and others would not vote for <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef>— All parties were mortified by
							the result— Even the Virginians he says, in which I think he is
							mistaken. But this is certain that the new Speaker has given extensive
							dissatisfaction by his appointment of Committees and Dickinson says
							there is already more dissension in the House than there was in the
							whole of the last Congress. I made a draft of a Message to send with the
							Secret Journals of the old Congress, which I took to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, together with the despatches
							received last Sunday, from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">J.
								Forsyth</persRef> at Madrid— At the President’s I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thompson— They had the annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury
							under revision— A new thing. This Report, is made directly from the
							Secretary of the Treasury to Congress, and during this Administration
							has hitherto not even been communicated to the President before it was
							sent in— The consequence of which was that last year it presented a view
							of the finances quite at variance with that exhibited in the message; a
							circumstance seized with avidity and used with eagerness against the
							Administration— To guard against it this year, the President desired
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> himself to Draft the paragraphs in
							the Message relating to the finances which he did; and now his own
							Report was submitted for revision— There is no information in it—except
							what was already in the message— One weak point in it will probably give
							rise to some discussion— There is a deficiency of about one Million of
							dollars in the supplies of the year, which he relies will not be missed,
							because all the expenditures of the year, are not demanded within the
							year. It will not be called for at the Treasury, until sometime in the
							course of the year ensuing; and as the supplies of that year, are
							expected to be superabundant; the reliance is that that the deficiency
							of this year, will be made up by the excess of the next— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun was suggesting to the President a
							paragraph to be added to the report displaying this expectation in more
							explicit terms— There is in the Report much coquetting with the
							manufacturing interest; but it contains no definite views of any utility
							and its principal lever for raising the revenue, is to raise the duties
							of various articles paying 15 and 20 per Cent ad valorem to 25. Calhoun
							and Thompson were joking about the new Speaker and his Committees, which
							they thought as ill chosen and as ill-sorted, as they could have been if
							drawn by lot. I told them they <pb type="ms" n="177"/>had truly done
							themselves good service by changing the Speaker.— I spoke to the
							President of Vice-Consuls, appointed, one by the <persRef
								ref="ivanoff-theodore">Russian Consul General</persRef>, another by
							one of the British Consuls, and for whom exequatur’s are desired. It was
							a question whether Consuls have the power of appointing Vice-Consuls,
							unless by special authority expressed in their Commissions. I thought
							the British Government had made such an objection to some of our
							Consuls— The President was of the same opinion—to be examined into— As I
							was coming out from the President’s I met <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Hay</persRef>, who spoke of a
								<persRef ref="munroe-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.

							recalled from that office, with his misfortunes and ruin, consequent
							thereon; and with his having been obliged to fly, and take refuge from
							them under his, Norderling’s protection— I read to Stackelberg
							Norderling’s Letter, and told him we should be obliged to make a
							representation to his Government concerning it— I had never known of an
							example of a foreign officer’s treating <pb type="ms" n="178"/>a person
							appointed by another Government; and accredited to him in such a
							manner;—it was true that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison had
							been our Consul at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas— He had fallen
							into dissensions with the Governor, and at the demand of the Danish
							Minister, founded on the complaints of that Governor had been recalled—
							As we could not try the Merits of his dispute with the Governor, he had
							been recalled in compliance with the demand, without discussing the
							merits of the quarrel— But that Governor was M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bentzon; he had in all probability been in this very case in
							the wrong; and had very lately been by his own Government, dismissed
							from his Office, and heavily amerced for corrupt participation in the
							Slave-trade— A misunderstanding with such a man, was therefore no
							dishonour, and if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison had in
							consequence of it been ruined, and unable to satisfy his Creditors; it
							was his misfortune and not his fault; not a subject of reproach; but a
							calamity to repair— Stackelberg said he was much astonished at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Norderling’s Letter, which certainly was
							not proper, and he could not account for it. He believed however he was
							so far right, that the king’s sanction was necessary for the admission
							of a Consul at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartholomews— He had no
							doubt of our right by the Treaty to have a Consul there; and was assured

							family with him.— But he, Johnson thought he had better not— I said I
							thought so too; though I did not feel warranted to advise him— He said
							Todd’s private Affairs were very much involved, and his property had

								<persRef ref="dowson-alfred">Dowson’s</persRef> and left a Card for

							dissatisfied, at not having had a new appointment to a mission abroad,
							and imputed to me that none had been offered him. Eustis said it might

							place of a <persRef ref="meek-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Meek</persRef> deceased— Two Newspapers of the three allowed by Law
							for the State, are re-appointments. The <persRef ref="blackman-n">Editor
								of the third</persRef>, at both Sessions of the last Congress, is
							dead, and the paper itself extinct or suspended— To supply the place,
							Noble; the Senator has recommended one paper; and Hendricks the

							several members of the Legislature of Indiana, and most of the
							signatures to both applications being the same— I told them I would
							appoint either of the Printers, whom they should agree upon, but could
							not appoint both— They preferred the Evansville Gazette on the ground of
							its local situation. But Noble said that <persRef ref="taylor-waller"
								>Taylor</persRef>, the other Senator from Indiana, had kept copies
							of the two memorials for the curiosity of the thing; and complained that
							it placed the members from the State in a very awkward situation. With
							regard to the District Attorney, Noble asked if an appointment had been
							made— I told him yes—of <persRef ref="dewey-charles">Charles
								Dewey</persRef> a member of the Legislature— Noble said he had
							written directly to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>,
							recommending a <persRef ref="sullivan-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sullivan</persRef> (of Virginia) and requesting that the
							appointment might be delayed till after the meeting of Congress— And the
							President had told him, that his Letter was at the Department of State.
							I said I had not seen it, and knew not that he had written such a
							Letter— The Account of the Death of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meek
							was received a few days before the meeting <pb type="ms" n="181"/>of
							Congress, and with it Letters from <persRef ref="parke-benjamin">M<hi

							and <persRef ref="jennings-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jennings</persRef> the Governor of the State, earnestly recommending
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dewey— These Letters I took to the
							President who directed that a Commission for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dewey should immediately issue; which had been done— Noble
							said it would excite a great deal of feeling in the state, and that now,
							the whole delegation had united in recommending M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sullivan; to which Hendricks assented. He (Noble) said he
							supposed the nomination to the Senate, for the permanent appointment,
							need not be the of the same person who had the temporary appointment— I
							said no— It was usual to appoint the same person, but if <hi
								rend="italic">reasons</hi> should be assigned for a change, they
							would be fully weighed and considered. Noble replied that they would <hi
								rend="italic">probably</hi>, assign reasons, and repeated that the

								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">D. Brent</persRef>, the Chief Clerk, and

								ref="strong-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

							came, with two of his Colleagues, <persRef ref="mcneill-archibald"
								>M’Neill</persRef> and <persRef ref="connor-henry">Conner</persRef>—
							M’Neill had a written application, with numerous signatures, requesting
							the appointment of a newspaper, for printing the Laws, at Fayetteville,
							instead of Washington or New bern; on the ground that these two places
							are too near together, and both too near to Raleigh, where the third
							paper is printed, for the suitable distribution of the Laws throughout
							the State— I told them that the appointments were already made, though
							the Letters were not yet despatched— I stopped that which had been
							written for Washington, and desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Neill to write me a Letter naming the paper and printer at
							Fayetteville whom he wished to have the preference, and also that he
							would see the Representative from the District, from which the printing
							must be taken, to ascertain if he has no objection, to the removal,
							which he promised me he would— Burton said he thought <persRef
								ref="hall-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef>
							would not object— At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, I took over my draft of a Letter to the
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, in reply to his of 3. August, on the case of the
							Apollon. The President appeared to be a little alarmed at <pb type="ms"
								n="182"/>a confidential Letter that he had received from <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Ingersoll</persRef> at Philadelphia,
							informing him that the <persRef ref="anduaga-unknown">Spanish Minister
								Anduaga</persRef>, who is now at Philadelphia, had determined not to
							come and reside in the district, until the affair of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> quarrels with the
							Governors of <persRef ref="callava-jose">Pensacola</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="coppinger-jose">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Augustine</persRef> shall have been settled to his satisfaction: and
							that the French Minister de Neuville, complains of meeting difficulties
							in his Negotiations. The President spoke of the tone of Anduaga’s Notes
							as irritating, and almost offensive; and he seemed apprehensive that
							Anduaga’s representations might impel the Spanish Government to some
							rash act of hostility— He therefore suggested the idea, of sending a
							special Messenger to Spain, with instructions and documents to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							explaining all the transactions, and directing him in a conciliatory
							manner to avert any hasty measure on the part of Spain— He spoke first
							of employing Shaler and then <persRef ref="tudor-william">William
								Tudor</persRef>, for this agency— I did not directly oppose this
							idea, of sending a special Messenger, though I doubt its expediency. I
							thought Spain too deeply engaged in affairs of far deeper interest at
							home, and upon too bad terms with all the great European Powers to be
							disposed for quarreling upon such trifles as these— And that by
							manifesting very earnest solicitude upon the subject we should only
							perhaps give them a hint to make it more serious than they otherwise
							would— I therefore counteracted this impression indirectly, by starting
							doubts whether a sudden departure of Shaler or of Tudor for Spain, would
							not rather surprize and alarm the public— I observed that General
							Jackson had as yet had the opportunity of answering the first complaint
							only of the Spanish Minister. There have since been received a second
							and a third of which no communication had yet been made to him. With
							regard to the first, he had answered; and transmitted testimony
							disproving many of the charges in Callava’s protest; and shewing that
							Callava had no special character as Commissioner, he having refused to
							produce any credentials as such, to General Jackson, and informed him
							that he had <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> to deliver up the Province as
							its Governor— So that Callava had not even the right on the point of
							form upon which this whole altercation arose. It was due to General
							Jackson to give him the opportunity of answering upon the second and
							third complaint as he had upon the first— My own idea was that I should
							write to the Spanish Minister communicating to him copies of Jackson’s
							answer to the Note of <persRef ref="salmon-hilario">Salmon</persRef>,
							and of the testimony which he has sent with it, and promising a further
							answer, when we shall have heard from him on the affair of the
							banishment of the Spanish Officers from Pensacola, and on the seizure of
							the papers at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine— This would give
							us several months of time, and as there was a total change of the
							Spanish Ministry, about once a Quarter, the whole subject will have
							become stale and lost its interest, before a definitive decision upon
							the case will become necessary— I observed to the President, that as I
							had anticipated there was now a Resolution before the House of
							Representatives, calling for all the papers relating to all these
							transactions— The House had yesterday decided that it should lay on the
							table; but it might be called up again and passed to-morrow. The
							President said that it would be necessary soon to decide upon the course
							to be pursued; whether to accept immediately, General Jackson’s
							resignation; or to delay it, until the new organization of the territory
							shall require a new appointment—whether all the papers shall be
							communicated to Congress, or only such as may be necessary to explain
							the subjects of difference between Jackson, and Callava and <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef>. He was apprehensive
							that the European allies, might intrigue with Spain to kindle this
							affair up into a quarrel between her and us— The consequence of which
							was that we should suffer in our <pb type="ms" n="183"/>commerce and
							revenue— He said this was the third time General Jackson had brought the
							Government into great difficulty, and that the cause would not bear us
							out in a quarrel with Spain, for it. If we were to quarrel with Spain,
							it were much better, to break upon South American independence, than for
							the rights of a mulatto at Pensacola. He desired me therefore to send
							the papers round to the members of the Administration. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> had hitherto not been consulted, from delicacy to
							the state of his Relations with General Jackson— But the papers should
							now be sent to him, as well as to the rest, and he would judge for
							himself whether he should take part in the deliberations upon them— I
							left with the President a list of the appointments made during the
							recess of Congress, and part of which will require nominations to the
							Senate, during the present Session; among them is the District Attorney
							of Indiana— I mentioned to the President, <persRef ref="noble-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Noble’s</persRef> remarks to me
							the other day; he perfectly recollected my having laid before him the
							recommendatory Letters from the <persRef ref="jennings-jonathan"
								>Governor</persRef> and <persRef ref="parke-benjamin">District
								judge</persRef> of Indiana, and his direction that a Commission

							had received Noble’s Letter— With regard to the nomination to the Senate
							he reserved the subject for further consideration— The case of the
								<persRef ref="morrell-john">Marshal of Georgia</persRef> was
							mentioned. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford sent over to me this
							morning, a Letter from Morel to him, soliciting a re-appointment. I gave
							that Letter to the President, and reminding him of the Letter, from the
								<persRef ref="clark-john">Governor</persRef>, President of the
							Senate and Speaker of the House of Georgia, against Morel, and of the
							anonymous Letter charging Morel with a most atrocious murder of a black
							man, for which he was indicted by a Georgia Grand Jury, but acquitted by
							a jury of trial, I told the President of the application to me, by
								<persRef ref="thompson-wiley">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> one of the Georgia members of the House, who
							wished to ascertain whether <persRef ref="triplett-unknown">Major
								Triplett</persRef> would be appointed; but expected that M<hi

							said that if he should not he, Thompson had no complaint to make against
							him— The President said that he wished to get rid of the man— He
							believed there was too much truth in the anonymous Letter. I said that
							there might be party Spirit mingled also in this affair— Perhaps it
							might be best to enquire of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							whether he would recommend the re-appointment of Morel— The President
							said he would consult him, and also <persRef ref="elliot-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot</persRef> the Senator from
							Georgia; and directed me to send him the anonymous Letter to be shewn to
							them— He asked me to dine with him next Friday with the foreign
							Ministers— I told him of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Strong’s
							application for the appointment of Governor or judge in Florida; but he
							thought the aim rather too lofty, for an ex-member of Congress— <persRef

								Strong</persRef> came to make enquiry of the success of his
							application for Office in Florida— An ex-member of Congress is a wasp
							who has lost his sting: and it is piteous to see them soliciting offices
							of high distinction for which they are not qualified, as consolation for
							the loss of the confidence of their Constituents. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Strong that I thought some knowledge of
							the Spanish language would be required both for the Governor and judge—
							The State of New-York has got into a practice of changing almost the
							whole of her delegation at every Congress; it is one effect of the
							system of bargaining and intriguing which prevails there more than in
							any other quarter of the Union; and one consequence of it is that she
							sends more ordinary, inefficient men, than her proportion; they come
							with little knowledge of the general affairs of the whole Union, which
							form the subjects of deliberation in Congress, and by the time they have
							acquired experience necessary for the discharge of their duties, their
							two years of service expire, and they are heard of no more, unless like
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Strong applying for Offices suited to
							the level not of their capacities, but of the elevation which they had
							attained, and have lost. <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi

							something further about his accounts— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> had spoken to him of going to Spain which he
							told me would be very agreeable to him, if he could be accommodated with
							regard to the time; but said he had come home to settle <persRef
								ref="shaler-unknown">his brother’s Estate</persRef>; and having two
							law-suits involved in the operation, could not terminate his business in
							less than two or three Months. I said it would probably be as long as

								Shields</persRef>, now judge of the United States for the District
							of Mississippi had about the year 1815 been appointed the District

							Commissions, that Shields had never been District Attorney— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							brought a Letter from a person named <persRef ref="clarke-unknown4"
								>Clarke</persRef>, containing indications of suspicions, against
								<persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef>, the Astronomer
							who attended on the Commission, under the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of Ghent;— as having been too
							intimate with the British Astronomer, <persRef ref="tiarks-john"
								>Tiarks</persRef>— By their Observations they have brought the 45<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> degree of Latitude, nearly a mile
							further South, where it touches Lake Champlain, than it had been settled
							by former observations; by which a place called Rouse’s point, with
							costly fortifications erected upon it will be thrown within the British
							line— This has given great uneasiness in this country, and especially in
							the State of New-York, where Rouse’s point is situated— This M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke tells a story, of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiarks the British Astronomer’s having
							said to him in a Steam-boat, supposing him to be a Canadian, that
								<persRef ref="ellicott-andrew">Ellicott</persRef> the first
							Astronomer on the American side, had been a troublesome old fellow; but
							that Hassler was more accommodating; and then pointing to the spot where
							they found the 45<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> degree touch the lake
							had said, we shall run the line to end there— Upon this foundation
							Clarke built his surmise that Hassler had been corrupted— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun that we had heard of this and
							enquired into it, more than two years ago, and found it was mere
							unwarranted suspicion— Calhoun said Clarke had mentioned the whole
							affair to <persRef ref="spencer-john">J. C. Spencer</persRef>, and
							proposed to give notice of it to the General Government—upon which
							Spencer, to make mischief had said, the General Government would care
							nothing about it— I said at all Events there was no harm done, the
							Commissioners under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article having
							disagreed— Their Reports are not yet made— But Hassler so far from
							favouring the British side had first started the claim of determining
							the Latitude geocentrically, with allowance for the difference between
							the polar and equatorial diameters of the Earth. I omitted, rather
							carelessly to read the Letter which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun had brought with him— I dined at the President’s with the
							foreign Ministers—parts of their Legations; sundry members of both
							Houses of Congress and Commodores <persRef ref="porter-david"
								>Porter</persRef> and <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"

								ref="poletica-pierre">Russian</persRef> at the left of the
							President— At his request I took the seat opposite to him, at the centre
							of the table; between the two Senators <persRef ref="king-rufus"
								>King</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef ref="king-william2"
								>King</persRef> of Alabama— The dinner was short; and I came home
							before 8 O’Clock. I spoke to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi

							received yesterday, from <persRef ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi

							at the morning service, which was performed by <persRef

							a celebrated Clergyman settled at Baltimore; but by his pronunciation
							apparently an Irishman— His text was from 2. Chronicles 6.18. “But will
							God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven, and the
							heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee: how much less the house which I
							have built!” He preached without notes; but a regularly constructed
							Sermon, divided into three parts— His language was elegant, his style
							florid, after the fashionable Irish manner, dealing much in antithesis,
							and studded with apostrophes. His delivery was easy, and natural, as
							suited to extemporaneous discourse; addressing directly every hearer—
							His voice not sonorous nor agreeable: nor quite loud enough to fill the
							house.— It was thinly attended— <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> the Unitarian
							preached for the first time at the Capitol, to a crowded auditory. His
							election as Chaplain to the House of Representatives occasioned much

								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> the episcopal preacher at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church last Sunday preached a Sermon of coarse
							invective upon the House, who he said by this act, had voted Christ out
							of doors; and he enjoined upon all the people of his flock, not to set
							their feet within the Capitol, to hear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sparks— In the course of the last week <persRef ref="patterson-walter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef>, a member
							from the State of New-York, moved that the House should proceed to the
							choice of another Chaplain, on the pretence that he had vacated the
							appointment by non attendance— It appeared that the <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Speaker</persRef> had for some time omitted to
							give notice to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks of his appointment,
							and that Sparks was then in the City ready to commence the performance
							of his duties. Patterson after some discussion <pb type="ms" n="188"
							/>finding himself unsupported, withdrew his motion— This extraordinary
							mode of opposition has only served to render Sparks more conspicuous,
							and to sharpen the curiosity to hear him— After Church I called at
								<persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							and <persRef ref="williamson-william">Williamson</persRef>, also a
							member of Congress from the State— Cushman said Williamson would call
							upon me to-morrow morning.— At the Office, I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="glendy-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Glendy</persRef>,
							who in the course of half an hour’s Conversation gave me a history of
							his adventures in this Country, since his arrival here from Ireland, in
							1799. particularly his relations with <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, to whom he
							had brought Letters of recommendation. I dined with the <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Russian Minister, Poletica</persRef>, it being
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> birth-day—
							About 25 in company, heads of Departments, and the Corps Diplomatique—
							The dinner was rather dull— <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef><unclear>came</unclear> late, and <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>,
							the British Consul General who was with him, on entering the Parlour;
							went up and spoke to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde
								de Neuville</persRef>, who immediately went with him out of the
							Room. When dinner was announced, on passing into the dining Hall, we
							found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville, and Baker were there—
							Hyde and Canning neither spoke to nor looked at each other— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica, asked me for the toast as usual,
							upon which I gave the Emperor Alexander, and the cause of the Cross:
							which he returned by toasting the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> of the United States, and the cause of Peace,
							as long as possible— None of the other usual toasts in honour of the
							holy allies were given; we were a very short time at table, and the
							company retired almost immediately after dinner. The President of the
							Senate <persRef ref="gaillard-john">Gaillard</persRef>, and the Speaker
							of the House <persRef ref="barbour-philip">P. P. Barbour</persRef> were
							of the Company. I asked <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt"
								>Stackelberg</persRef> the Swedish Chargé d’Affaires, whether he had
							seen the quarrel between Hyde de Neuville, and Canning, in the Entrance
							Hall, at the President’s— He had seen it all; and twice interposed
							between them— I asked him what they had said? He answered he did not
							know—by which he merely meant to decline telling what they had said—
							Poletica was a little more communicative— He said that the quarrel had
							long been brewing— That one of its principal recent causes, was a Letter
							of <persRef ref="collier-george">Sir George Collier’s</persRef>, lately
							published in all the Newspapers, and containing severe reflections upon
							the French Government, as still suffering the Slave-trade to be carried
							on under their flag. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville had been
							much hurt at this Letter, and Canning had indulged himself in some
							sarcastic remarks upon it— At the Ball given by De Neuville last week in
							honour of the <persRef ref="marietheresecharlotte">Duchess of
								Angouleme’s</persRef> birth-day, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning went away before supper; De Neuville, spoke of this to Canning,
							while sitting at table at the President’s; and expressed his regret at
							the circumstance— Canning it seems answered that there were places where
							he took pleasure in staying, and others where attendance was mere
							compliance with forms— De Neuville was much offended at this, but said
							nothing more at table. They left the Drawing-room after dinner, nearly
							at the same time; and before the Carriage of either of them had arrived—
							While in the entrance-hall De Neuville took Canning aside, to ask
							explanation of what he had said at table; but instead of being satisfied
							with his answer, was more incensed by it— The irritation increased on
							both sides, until De Neuville, raising his voice, said “oui Monsieur, je
							vous la repete en présence de tout le Corps Diplomatique, que la
							franchise et la politesse sont des qualités <hi rend="italic"
								>éminemment</hi> Françaises[”]— Poletica did not say what was
							Canning’s answer; but the fact was that before they parted there was
							menace of personal violence between them on the spot— By De Neuville
							with the clenched hand; by Canning, in laying his hand upon his sword—
							Poletica says that De Neuville was wrong in breaking out, there, and
							that he is now sensible of it— But he says the original wrong was in
							Canning, who is apt to <pb type="ms" n="189"/>make sarcastic remarks.
							There has been some correspondence between them, since Friday, but
							apparently no adjustment of the difference between them hitherto.

								ref="gregg-andrew">A. Gregg</persRef>, now Secretary of the State of

								ref="barstow-gideon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef>
							of Pennsylvania, came to enquire about the settlement of an account
							against one of the Ghent Treaty Commissions— The only question relating
							to it appears to be to which of the two Commissions it is to be charged.
							Baldwin said <persRef ref="ellicott-andrew">Ellicott</persRef> had died
							leaving his family destitute; and in great need of payment— He asked if
							an Administration upon the Estate would be necessary, to receive the
							payment: I thought it would, to give the voucher which would be required
							at the Treasury. Baldwin asked whether the papers relating to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> Florida quarrels
							would be soon communicated— He said that there would be a very serious
							attack upon Jackson in Congress. I told him that I was ready and willing
							to communicate every scrap of paper relating to the affair now— But the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> wished to withhold
							the papers altogether—or at least while the subject is in negotiation
							with Spain— Baldwin said it was sufficient reason for withholding the
							papers that there is a Negotiation pending. He asked if I <pb type="ms"
								n="190"/>thought there had been any thing wrong in the proceedings
							of General Jackson— I said that which it would be most difficult to
							justify, was the seizure of the papers at S<hi rend="superscript"

							which had been signed by <persRef ref="butler-robert">Col<hi

							of the appointment of a District Judge in Maine. He recommends a
								<persRef ref="ames-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ames</persRef>, and understands the intriguing for the appointment
							of <persRef ref="ware-ashur">Ware</persRef>, as others do— Fuller spoke

								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"

							something should be done to counteract it— He did not appear however to
							have matured his ideas, with regard to the <hi rend="italic">way</hi>,
							in which it is to be counteracted— He as well as others appear to think,
							that if all this management is used on one side, without any
							countermining on the other, it must and will succeed. He gave me some
							items of the allegations current for the purpose of discrediting me— One
							was, that <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Walshs</persRef> Newspaper was
							set up by me; and that its support of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef>, was all to support me— Another that the failure
							of the Negotiation with France was owing to difficulties made by me; and
							that in the negotiation at Ghent the notes that I wrote were so
							offensive, that it was found necessary to substitute others, in their
							stead. I told Fuller that all the papers relating to the Negotiation
							with France would be communicated to the Committees of the two Houses—
							They would see what the difficulties were— My opinion was that we had
							gone too far in the way of conciliatory propositions— But others might
							judge of them. As to the Ghent Negotiation, <persRef ref="bayard-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> had once taken
							the trouble of cloathing in his own language a despatch that I had
							written, and at my request his draft had been used instead of mine for
							the text of the despatch; but that had been altered as much as mine; it
							was the first despatch we wrote; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard had not repeated the experiment— And almost the whole of the
							subsequent notes was written by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and by me— Fuller
							said there was about as much foundation for the Report he had heard as
							is usual in such cases— As to Walsh’s paper, I had no more hand I told
							him in setting it up, than he had. Walsh had often severely censured me,
							and what was more offensive to me, had attacked <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>— He said that would pass for a
							mask— One reason he said why Walsh’s paper was said to be my paper, was
							his defence of General Jackson’s late transactions in Florida, even
							before he had been heard— I said it was natural enough that those who
							meant to make thrusts at me through Jackson’s side should take the
							defence of Jackson as a proof of subserviency to me— The fact was that
							in passing through Philadelphia, I had dined at <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant’s</persRef> in company with Walsh, just at the time when
							the affair of <persRef ref="callava-jose">Callava</persRef> was figuring
							in the newspapers— I had received Jackson’s report of the Affair, and
							had said, that in my opinion he had been throughout the transaction
							substantially right— Walsh told me he was of the same opinion, even upon
							the facts as they were then known to the public; but I had no controul
							over the opinions of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh— He was
							perfectly independent of me. Fuller said there were other subjects upon
							which he wished to converse with me, but must reserve them for another
							occasion, being now engaged. He said <pb type="ms" n="191"/>M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><persRef ref="edwards-ninian"
								>Edwards</persRef> the Senator from Illinois had told him that M<hi

						<p><date>28. VI:</date> I went this Morning to the Office before eleven
							O’Clock— That is, upwards of an hour earlier than usual, and had a
							succession of visitors there— First <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.
								Cook</persRef> of Illinois— He mentioned that <persRef
								ref="lucas-john">judge Lucas</persRef> had written to him,
							requesting him to enquire, if any complaints had been addressed to the
							Department, or to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							against him, on the allegation of his having misrepresented the opinions
							of the people of Missouri— I told him that no such complaint had been
							made here, either to the Department; or so far as I knew, to the
							President; though I had seen such charges against him in the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis Enquirer.— Cook told me of the
							Mission given by <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> to <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Thomas</persRef>
							the Senator from Illinois to examine not the Banks, but the Land-Offices
							in the States of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Cook says it is
							in violation of the principle of the Constitution that no member of
							Congress shall hold an Executive Office; and also of the Law, which
							prohibits a member of Congress from being a contractor— He examined
							three or four Land Offices, where never a foot of land has been sold;
							has been preaching wherever he went, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford for the next Presidency, and is paid by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford at discretion— Cook says that Thomas told him he
							took the Mission because he needed the compensation for it— Some notice
							has been taken of this affair in the Washington City Gazette; at which
							Thomas is in great indignation and has used both menaces and promises to
							induce him to give up the author or publisher of the Letter— I asked
							Cook what was the meaning of an Editorial Article in the Edwardsville
							Gazette, quizzing <persRef ref="coles-edward">Edward Coles</persRef>. He
							said it was only because Coles had actually been to the Editor of that
							paper, and asked him to announce him as a Candidate for the Office of
							Governor of the State; telling him he was neither an Edwards man nor a
							Thomas man; but meant to stand on his own bottom, when Cook said he
							could not get three hundred votes throughout the State— Cook said the
							affair of Thomas’s Land Office-mission would probably be noticed this
							day in Congress; but it was not— <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaler</persRef> came to make some
							further settlement of his Accounts— There are two or three Charges,
							which there is some difficulty in admitting— <persRef
								ref="ruggles-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ruggles</persRef>, Senator from Ohio came with a <persRef
								ref="ward-unknown4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef>
							now of that State; but formerly of Massachusetts, and a Grandson of the
							late <persRef ref="ward-artemas">General Artemas Ward</persRef>— He
							wishes to be employed to go to Europe as a bearer of despatches—
								<persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Sewall</persRef> came to ask for a copy of the Census to send
							to <persRef ref="worcester-unknown">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Worcester</persRef> for his Gazette, but I have not a copy even for
							the use of the Department. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sewall told me
							that he was succeeding here in his profession, entirely to his
							satisfaction; and far beyond his expectations. <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> brought me a Letter from himself to <persRef
								ref="green-samuel">Samuel Green</persRef> of New-London, about a
							copy-right. He is apprehensive of losing it by having neglected to
							deposit a Copy at the Department of State within the six months— The
							Doctor thinks the copy-right may <pb type="ms" n="192"/>still be saved
							by depositing a copy after the time has expired— I thought the Law was
							otherwise, but referred it to the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney-General</persRef>— <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton</persRef>, Chairman of the
							Committee of Commerce came to ask again for a communication of papers,
							relating to commercial affairs. Copies of the papers relating to the
							Negotiation with France had already been transmitted to the Committees
							of Foreign Relations both of the Senate and House of Representatives— I
							had reserved one copy for the use of the Office, but promised to send it
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton: and I shewed him the extract
							from the Letter of <persRef ref="harrison-robert">R. M.
								Harrison</persRef> of 7. September last, relating to the operation
							of the Navigation Act in the West-Indies— Newton has for many years
							represented the borough of Norfolk; where the Navigation Act is most out
							of favour, and where they are now getting up a memorial against it. The
							Governor of Virginia too, <persRef ref="randolph-thomas">Thomas Mann
								Randolph</persRef>, son in Law to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, has thrown
							his weight into the Scale by an invective against the Navigation Act in
							a Message to the Legislature of that State. I took over to the
							President, Letters received this Morning from <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">Judge Fromentin</persRef>— One of these is
							in reply to mine informing him that he had mistaken the extent of his
							authority— He persists in his opinion and promises to assign his reasons
							hereafter— Another is a Letter to <persRef ref="henley-john">Captain
								Henley</persRef> of the Hornet, declining to assume Jurisdiction,
							upon a vessel taken by him into Pensacola with Slaves. The President
							said the sooner we could get rid of the Priest, the better— I mentioned
							to the President that <persRef ref="trimble-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Trimble</persRef> of Kentucky had this
							day offered a Resolution in the House, calling for all the papers of the
							Negotiation with France; and that there is another Resolution calling
							for all the papers relating to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> Florida quarrels— I was for giving them all; and
							letting Congress battle it out among themselves upon them. The President
							appointed a Meeting of the Members of the Administration for to-morrow,
							to decide upon it. I spoke to him of <persRef ref="raguet-condy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguet’s</persRef> wish to go as
							Consul to Lima, or to Rio de Janeiro. He thought there would be some
							difficulty in displacing <persRef ref="robinson-jeremy"
								>Robinson</persRef> or <persRef ref="hill-henry">H. Hill</persRef>—
							But will think of it further— I left with the President a draft of an
							answer to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef>, concerning the Newfoundland Pirates—
							In the Evening I received a Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning promising to call upon me at three, to Morrow— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> was a little better, and barely able to dine below.
							My difficulty of writing continues.</p>

						<p><date>29. VII.</date><persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Newton</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Commerce
							came this morning to the Office in high Spirits, saying he brought me
							good news— He had in his hand a Newspaper of the Island of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Christopher’s, with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="hollingsworth-jehu">Jehu Hollingsworth</persRef> at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Eustatius, enclosing it to <persRef
								ref="rodney-caesar">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney</persRef>
							the member of the House, who had given it to Newton— The Newspaper
							contained a Petition from the Legislative Assembly of the Island of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Kitts to the British House of Commons;
							imploring a relaxation of the restrictions upon the Commerce between the
							West-India Islands and the United States of America, and representing
							the Islands as on the brink of ruin from perseverance in that system,
							and from the counteracting Navigation Laws of the United States— Newton
							insisted upon reading to me the whole Petition, which is long, and will
							serve as a full answer to the memorial which is coming on to Congress
							from his constituents of Norfolk. He said he would have given it to
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> to publish in the
							Intelligencer, but he believed it would be best to let those people who
							were attempting to mislead the public opinion push on, and get
							themselves as deep into absurdity as they chose, and then spring this
							upon them at once— It comes very seasonably for the maintenance of our
							system— I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton the despatch
							from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> of 3. January 1820.
							giving the account of his dinner at <persRef ref="colquhoun-archibald"
								>Colquhoun’s</persRef>, and to which he refers in a late despatch—
							And I sent to Newton’s lodgings the papers relating to the Negotiation
							with France— <persRef ref="smith-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> W. Smith</persRef>, Senator from South-Carolina came,
							and asked for the papers relating to the organization of a Government
							for Florida, for the use of the Committee of the Senate on the
							judiciary— They had already been sent to the Committee on the same
							Subject of the House of Representatives, with whom he said he would
							communicate concerning them— He also made some enquiries respecting
							nominations of Marshals and District Attorneys. In cases of nominations
							for re-appointment no new recommendations are required. The enquiries
							relating to the settlement of the accounts of persons <pb type="ms"
								n="193"/>to be reappointed, are to be made at the Treasury
							Department. <persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef>, a member of the House from New-York came to enquire
							what decision there had been upon the Petition to be discharged from
							prison, of a person named <persRef ref="gardiner-unknown"
								>Gardiner</persRef>; a public defaulter— The President had declined
							discharging him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood is Chairman of the
							Committee of the House upon the expenditures of the Department of State;
							and he asked me, if I had any Communications to make to him on the
							subject— I told him none; but would make any that the Committee should
							desire— The objects of expenditure would be found in the annual
							Estimates, and the sums appropriated for them in the Laws— The accounts
							of the Department were kept by a Clerk, and were settled every quarter
							at the Treasury. If the Committee should be disposed to inspect them,
							they would be found by the <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">fifth
								Auditor</persRef>. The appropriations were for the Salaries of the
							Officers, printing the Laws, and contingencies. Of the last one
							principal item was for the library; and there had been some expence in
							procuring balances, and copies of the Standard Weights and Measures of
							France and England— He went into the Library and inspected it himself—
							At one O’Clock the Cabinet Meeting was held at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>; and the only question
							discussed was whether all the papers relating to the negotiation with
							France, and all those relating to the transactions of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> in Florida, should be
							communicated to Congress, upon the two Resolutions, now before the House
							of Representatives to call for them— It was on all hands agreed that
							none of the papers ought to be communicated without a call; but all
							except myself, were apprehensive of evil consequences from the
							publication of the papers— Those containing the complaints of the
								<persRef ref="danduaga-joaquin">Spanish Minister</persRef> because
							the negotiation is yet pending— Those of the French Negotiation, because
							they are irritating; and the Letters of <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius"
								>Fromentin</persRef>; because they dishonour the Country— I am
							satisfied that all the papers should be given— But the papers are wanted
							by two classes of members in the House of Representatives—those who are
							panting for debate, to make fiery speeches—and those who are eager to
							have a thrust at the Secretary of State. And the two Classes may now be
							nearly resolved into one: It is the ground upon which the attack of the
							present Session is intended to be made upon the administration—to give
							all the papers now, will make ample field for a month’s debate, and give
							vent to ill humours which would grow more malignant by suppression—
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> said that if the House of Representatives thought as
							he did that General Jackson was wrong, they would pass a vote of censure
							upon his acts— And if they are to do that, it will be best to have their
							determination upon it before giving a final answer to the Spanish
							Government— My own opinion is that Jackson was at the foundation, right—
							But the prejudices against him in the cabinet are so strong, that I
							believe the best thing for his safety will be to bring him at once
							before the country. When Congress come to debate upon it, the feeling of
							the Country will be in his favour. It was finally determined that the
							Call, should be suffered to come, and that then all the papers should be
							given— The meeting broke up about four O’Clock, and returning from it I
							met <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> who had been waiting at my Office— We had a
							conversation upon the proposals of the Commissioners <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">P. B. Porter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">Barclay</persRef>. I told him that there seemed
							to be no necessity for them to come to Washington, to settle this
							question— It appeared to me that by the offer to take the intermediate
							line with a condition, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay had
							admitted his authority to take it unconditionally. The condition was
							certainly not within the authority of the Commission. General Porter,
							had been perfectly right in disclaiming the power of acceding to it, and
							I thought such a condition would have invalidated the decision itself if
							they had agreed to it. They were not a Commission to negotiate, but to
							decide where the line of the middle of the river and lakes actually
							runs. They might agree upon the principle of taking the deepest channel,
							or the middle line between Shores; and they might for the mutual
							accommodation of the two Countries, adopt sometimes the one, and
							sometimes the other of those principles; for example <pb type="ms"
								n="194"/>to avoid dividing an Island—but they had no authority to
							cede territory on either side. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay
							had not only travelled out of his record to make the proposal; but by
							offering to take the line in question upon a condition, he has proved
							that he considers himself authorized to agree to that line— His scruple
							is not as to the boundary, but as to the use which we might make of
							Islands within our line. The condition which he requires, we could only
							engage for by an agreement to be confirmed by both Governments, like
							that for disarming upon the lakes; and we are willing to accede to it,
							provided it shall be made reciprocal, and extended to all the Islands at
							the mouth of that river— As we had agreed to disarm the waters; we on
							our part were willing to disarm the Islands— Canning intimated that
							Barclay’s statement of the facts did not altogether agree with that of
							General Porter— He represented it as the only instance of departure,
							from the principle of the half way line between the two Shores, and one
							which on reference to a foreign Sovereign, could not possibly fail to be
							decided in favour of Britain— Barclay therefore by acceding to the
							middle line would in fact give up three small Islands belonging to
							Great-Britain; and might feel it to be his duty to insist upon the
							condition, as an equivalent for the cession. This I said was precisely
							what he could have no possible right to do. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning had not brought Barclay’s Letter with him, and said
							he would look over the papers again, and then give a definitive Answer—
							However desirous he was of promoting the agreement of the Commissioners,
							he thought he could not interpose in this case at-all— I then spoke to
							him of the case of <persRef ref="wilcocke-samuel">Wilcocke</persRef>,
							the man who was arrested in Vermont, by a process returnable to a Court
							at Burlington, and then carried into Canada, and imprisoned at Montreal—
							I gave Canning a Montreal Newspaper containing a publication by
							Wilcocke, shewing that he had been acquitted upon all the criminal
							prosecutions against him, asked him to read it, and told him that I
							wished they would release the man, without forcing us to renew the
							demand in official form— Our jurisdiction had been violated; if Wilcocke
							had consented to go, his consent could not repair the wrong to us— I had
							recently had an application from the <persRef ref="skinner-richard"
								>Governor of Vermont</persRef>, through a member of Congress about
							it; and if Wilcocke was not released we should soon have a Resolution
							brought forward in Congress concerning it— Canning said in that joking
							manner, which he thinks witty, but which is excessively
							indiscreet—[“]what a troublesome body this Congress is!” [“]Not quite so
							manageable as your Parliament; and you find even that sometimes
							troublesome” was my reply— Canning knew that Wilcocke had been
							acquitted; but said it was because certain testimony could not be
							brought to bear against him; and said the <persRef
								ref="dalhousie-george">Governor of Canada</persRef>, had not the
							power to release him— Yet he appeared to be disappointed when I told him
							I should on Monday answer him that we could not deliver up the men from
							Newfoundland, charged with Statute Piracy.— It was six O’Clock when I
							got home to dinner, after receiving a sharp note from the Spanish
							Minister Anduaga, about Jacksons Affairs, and complaining that I have
							not even acknowledged the receipt of his Notes— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef> spent the Evening here— Frye told me that last
							Evening a deputation from the Pennsylvania Delegation had waited upon
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, and invited him to stand a Candidate for the
							Presidency at the next election, to which he after some hesitation had
							assented— It is understood that a caucus of Members of the
							South-Carolina Legislature have recommended <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">Lowndes</persRef>— Frye told me also that in
							1820 <persRef ref="king-william2">W. King</persRef> had received between
							3 and 4000 dollars for service, as a Major General of Militia in 1812
							and 1813—when he was a member of the Senate of Massachusetts— Never
							having demanded it till six or seven years after the supposed service
							performed.</p>

								>President</persRef> who had desired him to call here— I mentioned
							to him the Letters against Morel, and gave him the anonymous Letter to
							read. He disbelieved the Story of the murder of the negro, and said
							Morel had made enemies by entering warmly into the party politicks of
							the State— But he had been acquitted of the murder of the negro, to the
							universal satisfaction of the people of Savannah— He could not but
							believe it was a fair trial, because the Solicitor General, and the
							whole Bar there could not have suffered it to be otherwise— The Laws of
							Georgia punished with death the murder of a black man—and when Morel had
							been charged with the murder of this man, he had prosecuted the printer
							for a libel— The Grand Jury had refused to find a Bill, on the principle

							That I understood a new attack upon General Jackson was meditated in

									>r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><pb
								type="ms" n="196"/><persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>
							of the House and <persRef ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Eaton</persRef> and <persRef ref="johnson-richard"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> of
							the Senate; and he said he thought the whole of the New-York and
							Pennsylvania delegations would be in his favour. I said I had some
							apprehensions that a part of the Virginia delegation who in the affair
							of the Seminole War supported him would now be against him— He said he
							supposed they would; but he thought none of them would be very
							strenuous, excepting <persRef ref="archer-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Archer</persRef>, whose attack would
							be as much against the administration, as against General Jackson—
								<persRef ref="johnson-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Johnson</persRef>, Senator from Louisiana, came with a claim from a
								<persRef ref="duncan-abner">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duncan</persRef> a lawyer at New-Orleans for services in the Courts,
							under Instructions from the Treasury Department— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, that the application must be to
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>; to which he assented— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>,
							called at the Office, and gave me a copy of the account of <persRef
								ref="king-william2">William King</persRef>; allowing him near 4000
							dollars, as a Major General in the service of the United States in 1812
							and 1813. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin member of the House
							called, and I spoke to him about the call for papers in the case of
							General Jackson— Baldwin appeared to be unwilling that the Resolution
							should pass, and yet not prepared to resist the call— He said if the
							question related to General Jackson alone he could count the house, and
							know friend from foe— But electioneering would mingle with this
							question, and there was more electioneering abroad than I was aware of—
							I told him that he might know more of the detail than I, but that there
							was violent electioneering, and that it would mingle itself in every act
							of Congress, I had no doubt, and had long known— He said that the papers
							when communicated would be referred to the Committee of foreign
							Relations, and he understood they were divided, on the question
							respecting Jackson—three and three, and one doubtful— I said that the
							papers relating to <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">Fromentin</persRef>
							would not be of the resort of the Committee of Foreign Relations, and
							that it would be more advisable I should think, to refer the whole to a
							select Committee— Baldwin said He had understood there was some
							misunderstanding between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell the
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations and me— He had therefore
							written a note to the President, proposing to him to send to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>, and to converse himself with him— Baldwin said he
							did not expect to come to Congress again. I told him and Bronaugh both,
							that the point in which I foresaw the greatest difficulty in vindicating
							Jackson would be for the seizure of the papers at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine; because there had been an
							agreement between <persRef ref="butler-robert">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Butler</persRef> and <persRef ref="coppinger-jose"
								>Coppinger</persRef>, that they should remain in possession of the
							Spanish Officer, till the question concerning them should be decided by
							the two Governments— Which agreement had been approved by this
							Government. Bronaugh said first that he thought there had been some
							evidence, of an intention in Coppinger to carry the papers away; but I
							did not recollect that there was such Evidence. He then said he thought
							General Jackson was not aware of the agreement— I had determined if
							possible not to let the day pass, without answering the Spanish
							Minister’s last Letter, and to accomplish I remained till dark at the
							Office— <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Fuller</persRef> came, and told me that he was going to morrow
							Morning with <persRef ref="fuller-margaret">his wife</persRef> home—
							They had just heard of the illness of two of their children— If they
							should find them recovered he should stay only a few days— He then spoke
							of the Caucus in the South-Carolina Legislature 110 members 57 of whom
							had agreed to recommend <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Lowndes</persRef>, as a
							Candidate for the next Presidential Election. He spoke also of the
							deputation of members of Congress from the North and the South, who had
							waited upon <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> last Friday, and invited him to stand a candidate,
							also at the next Election, to which he had after some hesitation
							assented; and since that time there had been an active canvass going on;
							and scarcely a member whose dispositions had not been sounded, with a
							view to making partizans for him. Fuller said that he was afraid of
							appearing officious; I had appeared indisposed to making any exertions
							in my own favour; but if something should not be done to counteract the
							caballing, public opinion would be forestalled, and a party too strong
							to be broken would be formed— He had no interest of his own in view— He
							did not even tend to be a Candidate for the next Congress. But he felt a
							pride in the honour of his Country; and was unwilling to see its highest
							dignity thus disposed of.— He should therefore on his return home,
							suggest to some gentlemen the propriety of moving, to shew at least that
							they are not disposed to abandon the claim to a Candidate of their own—
							He said he should see some Gentlemen this Evening, and propose to
							ascertain from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun the fact how far
							he had assented to stand a Candidate: though it was fully known that he
							had— I said I <pb type="ms" n="197"/>had some thoughts of speaking on
							the subject to him, myself, with a view to its bearing on the
							administration at this time.— Fuller asked me, if I had any objection to
							conversing with other members of Congress whom he named— I said none
							at-all— He named <persRef ref="tomlinson-gideon">Tomlinson</persRef> of
							Connecticut, <persRef ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tracy-albert">Tracy</persRef> of New-York, <persRef
								ref="plumer-william2">Plumer</persRef>, and all the New-Hampshire
							delegation, and <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Lincoln</persRef> of Maine—
							He said that possibly these Gentlemen, who were working so hard to raise
							recruits, might defeat themselves by their own indiscretion— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s cause had been ruined in that
							way; and his New-York Sentinel, got up for the express purpose of
							supporting him would not avail him— Fuller spoke also of a piece which
							appeared in the Washington City Gazette of Saturday; the day after the
							caucus cabal at Calhoun’s, full of the vilest and falsest ribaldry
							against me; republished from Tennessee and Georgia Papers, and repeated
							here precisely at the time when they were beating up for partizans to
							their new Candidate, among the members of Congress— He thought it ought
							to be answered, as it could most triumphantly be.— I told him that if it
							should be answered, it would immediately be said I was canvassing for
							the Presidency— I never that I recollect but once, undertook to answer
							any thing that was published against me in a newspaper; and that was at
							a time when I was in private life— To answer newspaper accusations would
							be an endless task. The tongue of falsehood can never be silenced: and I
							have not time to spare from public business to the vindication of
							myself. Fuller told me that <persRef ref="eustis-william"
								>Eustis</persRef> was perfectly well disposed; and that <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Russell</persRef>, had of late, that is
							within a few days, had manifested a disposition, not unfriendly to me—
							Eustis had said it was best, as he was of a headstrong temper to let him
							find his own way, and he had therefore said nothing to him— It was near
							seven O’Clock, when I got home to dinner; and I was writing till near
							Midnight to close the year.</p>
