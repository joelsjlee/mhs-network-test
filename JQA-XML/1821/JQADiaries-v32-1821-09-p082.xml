						<p><date>2. VI:</date> This day, like the latter part of yesterday was

									>r</hi> Whitney</persRef>, in the morning from Matthew 6.34.
							“Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take
							thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil

							Sunday; and in the afternoon from 2. Corinthians 7.2. “Receive us; we
							have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no

								ref="miller-mary">his daughter</persRef>, who has been some-time
							residing at <persRef ref="black-esther">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Black’s</persRef>— I examined my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> this day in several passages, and among the rest
							in that upon which he had been examined on Friday— I found him ready
							enough at parsing and sufficiently familiar with the grammatical
							construction of the sentences. But his deficiency consists in
							comprehending the precise meaning of many words in the sense annexed to
							them in any particular sentence— He applies to a word in one passage a
							meaning which it might have in another, but which it has not in that—
							This mistake in the meaning of a significant word, makes him miss that
							of the whole sentence to which it belongs— It shews that he is not yet
							well grounded in the Latin language; yet his construction of the passage
							in which he was examined was so nearly right that I could not avoid the
							suspicion that he had been unfairly treated— His examiner was <persRef
								ref="channing-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Channing</persRef>, the professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, a man
							himself quite incompetent to the Office, which he holds; palmed upon the
							University against the general voice of the public; and all but a
							majority of the Overseers—Hated and despised by the Students— Having
							never yet delivered a public Lecture, though he has been nearly two
							years in Office; and so ignorant, or so careless of the very elements of
							Oratory, that he has never given a tittle of instruction to any of his
							pupils to teach them even to speak loud enough to be heard— Why he
							should have been the examiner in Sallust, I know not.</p>

									>r</hi> Parkman</persRef> called upon me this Morning at 11. and
							I visited with him the newly erected hospital at West-Boston, and the
							Marine Hospital at Charlestown— The former is a very costly stone
							building, not yet completed: built by subscription, but in a style so
							expensive that it has absorbed all the funds subscribed, and left
							nothing to defray the current charges for maintaining the establishment.
							They propose therefore to receive patients not gratuitously, but at a
							board of 3 dollars a week, and have a project of engaging at that price
							the Seamen who are now received at the Marine Hospital in Charlestown.
							This I also visited with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman, and
							found there <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>
							the younger, Collector at Boston, <persRef ref="townsend-david">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Townsend</persRef> and his <persRef
								ref="townsend-solomon">Son</persRef>— The Marine Hospital is kept in
							very good order, and the patients are as comfortable as their
							circumstances permit— I went through the bed chambers and saw them all—
							Some complaint has been made at the Navy Department of the expensiveness
							of this hospital, and it was intimated to me, that the principal motive
							for this complaint was that the building was wanted for the purposes of
							the Navy-Yard.— It was observed also that the expences were less than
							the three dollars a week for each patient, which would be required at
							the New Hospital, and that this building was not large enough to
							accommodate the number of Patients usually provided for at the Marine
							Hospital. I had visited the latter once before, when it was under the
							superintendence of <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Waterhouse</persRef>. As we were
							returning through Charlestown, we stopped at the house of a <persRef
								ref="jaques-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jaques</persRef>, a virtuoso in the breed of cattle, and saw several
							remarkably fine animals, particular a Bull, and an English Dray Horse,
							both of which he keeps for breeding. He was not <pb type="ms" n="84"
							/>himself at home. On our return to Boston, I alighted at D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parkman’s, and saw <persRef
								ref="parkman-eliza">his wife</persRef>, a daughter of the former
							British Consul <persRef ref="mcdonough-thomas2">M’Donough</persRef>—
							Afterwards I went with <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet
								Welsh</persRef>, my son <persRef ref="adams-george"
							>George</persRef>, and <persRef ref="boyd-john">John Boyd</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="wiggin-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wiggin’s</persRef>, and saw his picture of the Capucin Chapel, which
							is much celebrated. He brought it with him from Italy. Its merit
							consists in a striking exhibition of perspective, by the admission of
							light only through one window at the end of the chapel— Dined with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Gray’s</persRef> in Summer Street— We went to his house at
							Cambridge, supposing the invitation had been to dine there. Harriet
							Welsh and her <persRef ref="bailey-charlotte">sister
								Bailey’s</persRef><persRef ref="bailey-unknown">daughter</persRef>
							went with us, and stopped at <persRef ref="keating-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Keating’s</persRef>— Finding M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray’s house at Cambridge shut up, we
							returned to Boston— They were yet waiting for us in Summer Street— Among
							the company was <persRef ref="chipman-ward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ward Chipman</persRef>, brother to <persRef
								ref="gray-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gray</persRef>,
							and now the British Agent to the Commission under the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 7<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>Articles of the Treaty of Ghent— <persRef ref="kirkland-john"
								>President Kirkland</persRef> was also there, and I spoke to him of
							the condition annexed to <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> admission at the University. I told him I had
							myself examined Charles in several passages of <persRef ref="sallust"
								>Sallust</persRef>, and although I had found him not perfect in his
							Construction, yet I did not think his deficiency such as justified the
							making his admission conditional; and I plainly intimated a suspicion,
							that <persRef ref="channing-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Channing</persRef> had not treated him fairly. I asked him by whom
							the examination would be after the vacation— He said by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing again, who he hoped had not
							suffered and would not suffer any prejudice to bias his judgment— And
							added that if at the end of the vacation Charles would be at Cambridge
							by 9 O’Clock, his examination should immediately take place. I
							determined to go with him myself— I spent the Evening at <persRef

							an account to indemnify him for losses sustained by him in consequence
							of his having been paid in depretiated Treasury Notes, during the late
							War— He has already had one negative answer from the <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, but wishes the
							case to be reconsidered. Degrand told me there were several precedents,
							and instanced particularly the case of the State Bank in which it had

							advised that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe should address a second
							Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, renewing the demand, and
							specifically stating all the stating all the cases in which he could
							ascertain that the allowance has been made— I said if the precedents
							could be shewn to be entirely parallel in principle, I thought the
							Secretary of the Navy would make the allowance to M<hi

								ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="dearborn-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin
								Dearborn’s</persRef>, the inventor of Patent Scales, and of many

							scales, which are made upon principles differing little from those of
								<persRef ref="pollock-allan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pollock</persRef>; whom he charges with having borrowed without his
							leave from him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dearborn’s other

							fastenings of windows, springs for shutting gates and economical self

							to accept, and I bespoke of him, a brass avoirdupois pound of his own
							making— After leaving him I called again at M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>11. V:30.</date> Immediately after I rose this morning, the master
							of the House, <persRef ref="hamilton-unknown4">Hamilton</persRef> took
							me into a back room, and told me that he was sorry to be the bearer of
							disagreeable intelligence; but an unfortunate accident had happened
							yesterday at <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> house; and
							there was a Messenger, who had come express with Letters to me
							concerning it. I desired immediately to see him— He brought me two
							Letters from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Quincy</persRef>. One written with the intention of
							sending it by my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>,
							and the other later, when he had concluded to send on his Man, as an
							Express— They were to inform me that about noon yesterday, the roof of
							my father’s house was discovered to be on fire; and as it blew at the
							time a brisk gale, the saving of the house had for some-time been
							despaired of. That by dint of very great exertions the fire had been
							subdued, but that the house was uninhabitable, and great damage had been
							done to the furniture, and to the doors and windows of <pb type="ms"
								n="87"/>the house in attempting to save them. Quincy advised me not
							to mention this event to my father, but to proceed upon our Journey, and
							observed that in the course of ten days the house would be entirely
							repaired and ready to receive my father again. But knowing the fortitude
							of my father’s character, I did not think it consistent with my duty to
							him to conceal from him an event in which his property was interested. I
							did not feel myself authorized to decide for him, withholding from him
							the state of facts, the question which naturally arose, whether he
							should on this emergency proceed upon his journey or return home— I
							therefore immediately told him what had happened. He received the
							intelligence with perfect composure, and after a short deliberation,
							determined to proceed— At 7. O’Clock after breakfasting at Hamilton’s,
							we rode ten miles to <persRef ref="wesson-unknown">Wesson’s</persRef> at
							Westborough; there rested an hour and came 9 Miles to <persRef
								ref="sikes-rueben">Sikes’s</persRef> tavern at Worcester.— There we
							found <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston</persRef>, who was much surprized and delighted to see my
							father. He had not expected him— The Court of Sessions for the County
							was this day meeting, and we fell in with <persRef ref="bancroft-aaron"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft</persRef> the
							clergyman, my old Classmate <persRef ref="fiske-oliver">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Oliver Fiske</persRef>, <persRef

								>Hastings</persRef>, <persRef ref="lincoln-unknown"
								>Lincoln</persRef> and <persRef ref="bigelow-timothy"
								>Bigelow</persRef>, members of the Bar. We dined at Worcester, and
							after dinner, I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, and
							saw the building erected for the antiquarian Society. We met there
								<persRef ref="thomas-isaiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaiah
								Thomas</persRef>, the original founder of the Society. The building
							is not yet finished, nor is there anything very remarkable in the
							antiquities which it contains— They are chiefly typographical; old books
							and newspapers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston presented to me,
							the Selectmen of Princeton, who to my surprize and mortification, had
							come all the way to Worcester, to do me honour— Boylston also told me
							that a cavalcade of the inhabitants of Princeton would meet us at the
							entrance of the town, and escort us to his house; and that they had an
							Address prepared to present me— That they had done all this of their own
							accord, without any agency or interference on his part— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, that I felt as grateful as
							possible to the inhabitants of Princeton for their kindness— That if I
							had come alone as they had expected, however conscious I should have
							been of having no pretension to the compliment which they were disposed
							to honour me with, I would not have declined it; but that being with my
							father, there would in my mind be so gross an incongruity in my
							receiving an honorary address of welcome, while he was present and
							unnoticed, that I relied upon him to excuse me with those Gentlemen, for
							declining to receive it— He said he would settle the matter with them
							entirely to my satisfaction. In proceeding from Worcester to Princeton,
							my father and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston in his carriage; I
							followed with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> in mine, and
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> brought up the rear in the
							Chaise— I made this arrangement, that the cavalcade and the escort might
							be for my father, and I only one of his suite— The cavalcade met us
							about half way from Worcester, and the gentleman at the head of it,
							successively came and welcomed, first my father, and then myself. But he
							delivered to me the written Address, which they had agreed upon, and had
							added to it, a short Address to my father. The escort consisted of
							nearly one hundred horsemen; and they conducted us to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s house. It was fifteen Miles
							from Worcester, and we arrived there after dark, somewhat annoyed with
							the rain— A collation had been provided for them by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, after which they at their desire
							passed in review, dismounted, before us, under the porch of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Boylston’s house— Boylston told me it was
							by mistake that the Address had been delivered to me, and that no answer
							would be expected to it. I had verbally answered with suitable thanks
							the welcome of the Captain of the cavalcade, and desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston to cause all the Gentlemen who
							had taken part in it, and in the address, to be assured, that I felt
							deeply sensible of the honour they had done me, and in omitting a
							written answer to the Address, was governed only by the motives which I
							had alledged for declining it— He promised that he would. The truth was
							that I had no doubt that <pb type="ms" n="88"/>the Address and the
							escort had both been gotten up, if not under his direct influence, at
							least in compliance with his wish, and because he had thought it would
							be gratifying to me. He had not expected my father, and had not
							considered how unbecoming it would be in me to receive an address merely
							of welcome, in his presence— But not being ambitious of ridicule, and
							holding in very low estimation that<hi rend="italic">mode </hi>of
							popular approbation, I was glad to avail myself of any good reason for
							escaping from an Address.— My father and my wife were both much fatigued
							at the end of our Journey, and the latter had in the evening a turn of
							fainting— The marshal of the cavalcade was <persRef ref="gill-unknown"

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-george;adams-john2" type="multi"
								>my Sons</persRef> to the top of Wachusett hill, which is about 3
							Miles from <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston’s</persRef> house— Its top is nearly 3000 feet above the
							level of the Sea, and it is said to be the highest elevation in the
							Commonwealth— There is therefore nothing physically very lofty in the
							Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Monadneck, about 30 miles distant
							from it in New-Hampshire is two or three hundred feet higher— From the
							top of Wachusett its distance to the eye would seem to be less than ten
							Miles— The prospect from Wachusett is extensive, and the Blue Hills near
							Boston are distinctly seen from it. I fancied I saw through the glass a
							part of Boston itself— The Hill is for the most part steep of ascent and
							covered with wood— There is no path even to ascend for a horse, and we
							were conducted by a guide. A carriage road over it might however easily
							be made— We were an hour going up, and as long coming down, although the
							distance is not more than a mile and a half. The large growth of
							trees—Oak, Ash and pine extends perhaps two thirds of the way to the
							top, the rest is mere shrubbery, and the line of separation between the
							large and small wood goes round the hill at the same elevation, as
							regularly as though it were drawn with compasses. We returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s to dinner, and afterwards
							walked round the farm again— The only book I have found here is a
							volume, published last year, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Boylston’s friend <persRef ref="nicholls-john">John Nicholls</persRef>,
							who was a member of Parliament during the War of the American
							Revolution, and several years after. I read part of it this day, and
							found it contained many curious and interesting anecdotes— Nicholls was
							an Independent member, always in opposition during the American War, and
							by an attachment to <persRef ref="fox-charles">Charles Fox</persRef>,
							then formed, drawn into the support of the Coalition Ministry, and their
							India-Bill, which he now very frankly condemns— His book, entitled
							“Recollections” bears hard upon the reputation and memory of Fox, of
								<persRef ref="pitt-william2">William Pitt</persRef>, and especially,
							and much too severely of <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Edmund
								Burke</persRef>, by far the greatest man of the three. Against him
							Nicholls indulges a strong personal animosity; and he represents him,
							probably with truth as the author of the India Bill which went under the

							motives—I hope unjustly.</p>

							within the State he had made such arrangements for the settlement of his
							Affairs, that my constant presence would not be required— He only wished
							to recommend his grandchild to my particular kindness, for the care of
							his education— I said that earnestly hoping that the time was far remote
							when his affairs would need the Execution of his Will, I could only
							assure him that at any and at all times I should be gratified in lending
							any aid in my power to the care and education of the child— He replied
							that his health was now good, but his age was 72. and he was subject to
							complaints which might remove him suddenly. In which case he should rely
							upon my friendly regard for the child, and that I should have very
							little trouble otherwise in the Execution of his Will.</p>

							beyond his house, and rested for an hour at <persRef

							brought her out with us to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> House, where we arrived between 5 and 6 in the

							five or six large packets of despatches from <persRef ref="brent-daniel"
								>D. Brent</persRef> at Washington. I met also in Boston, <persRef
								ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef> of Salem, who told

								ref="shaw-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw</persRef>
							came out also this evening from Boston— On our return from Princeton, we
							travelled not on the Turnpike, but upon the old roads— The Houses of
							Entertainment were not so good, but the face of the Country, much more
							pleasant and better cultivated— The improvement in the face of the
							Country, and in the aspect of the dwelling houses within the last 30
							years is great and cheering— It presents every where an appearance of
							comfort and plenty— We found the house at my fathers in a great measure
							repaired; the carpenters being still at work upon it— Part of the roof
							had been consumed; and the fire must have kindled from a spark issuing
							from the kitchen chimney— It is a new proof of the extreme danger of
							shingle roofs, which when old are no better than stubble. The house was
							saved by <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> going on the
							top of it and cutting away the part of the roof nearest to the fire, and
							by wet blankets spread over the part which was actually on fire— This
							was done by the advice of a Stranger, who was travelling by, while the
							fire was burning and whose house had been saved some months since by the
							same expedient. There was great damage done not only to much of the
							furniture, but to the windows and doors of the house in the attempt to
							save them by casting them out of the house. This frequently happens at
							fires. The first sentiment suited to this narrow escape from a great
							calamity, is that of thankfulness for the preservation— The second
							should be, of precaution for the future— A prudent man should have not
							only fire-buckets, bed Screws, and bags in his house, but should never
							be without a ladder. He should also have a few written or printed
							regulations, how to proceed in cases of fire, well impressed <pb
								type="ms" n="90"/>upon his own mind and upon those of his family. He
							should also have his dwelling house insured. I have insurance upon all
							mine in Boston, but not upon those at Washington.</p>

								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Stockton to the Navy Department
							concerning the transaction was scanty, the <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> has instructed him to report more

							stating his motives for the capture in each case separately and that he
							should state every circumstance tending to prove, first that the vessels
							captured were actually engaged in the slavetrade, and secondly, that
							American Citizens were interested in the property of them. This he
							promised to do, and said that the proof on the first point would leave
							no doubt of the fact, and on the second would amount at least to a
							violent presumption— I told him of the President’s desire that the
							vessel now here should be delivered up to the <persRef
								ref="devalnais-joseph">French Consul</persRef>, and of the advice I
							had given that a Court of enquiry should be called to report upon his

							in his favour, and would also enable me to give a satisfactory answer to
							the complaint of the French Minister— The Lieutenant did not incline to
							a Court of enquiry, apprehending that it might be assigned to officers,
							not sufficiently versed in the Laws applicable to his proceedings— He
							said however <pb type="ms" n="91"/>that if the Government should think a

							if the person failed at one passage to try him upon another; but this
							was not done to Charles— I examined him again this day in several
							passages of Sallust, and still found him construeing particular words
							incorrectly; that is assigning to the word a sense which belongs to it
							sometimes, but not in that sentence— To avoid this mistake requires a
							more thorough knowledge of the language than a freshman can possess. Yet
							I am satisfied that Charles is not well fitted in the Latin, and have no
							doubt he is at least equally deficient in the Greek. Had I known this

						<p><date>26. VI:</date> I was busied all the morning in reading a part of

							not even reach <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef>

							Athens given by <persRef ref="everett-edward">professor
								Everett</persRef>. It was for the purpose of explaining and
							commenting upon the Panorama, of that City, now exhibited in the town.
							It contained much information upon the subject of Athens generally and
							of its history, delivered in plain language, without pretension to
							ornament; about an hour and a quarter long. To some of the opinions held
							forth in it, although in the literary fashion of the day, I am not yet
							prepared to subscribe—as for example, that the Doric is the most perfect
							and only rational order of architecture—The Tuscan being as he said too
							rude to deserve the name of an order, and the Ionic, Corinthian and
							Composite too fantastical, and tawdry— The rams horns, the acanthus
							leaves, and the pedestal, were all censured as unsuited to their
							purposes and places without considering at all their effect upon the
							eye— But magnificence is a legitimate object of public buildings as well
							as strength, and the ornamented orders are the most pleasing to the
							sight. He said also that the Drama, was the only Department of
							Literature in which the Greek writers were unrivalled. But he seemed
							only to mean that the modern Theatres of France and England were
							exhibitions, not precisely of the same kind as those of the Antient
							Greeks. Even in this sense, I think the observation should have been
							somewhat qualified. There were between three and four hundred persons
							present at this Lecture, more than half of whom were Ladies— I dined
							with a company of 25 at <persRef ref="joy-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Joy’s</persRef>, and there
							was conversation upon the literary merits of <persRef ref="byron-george"
								>Lord Byron</persRef>— I was surprized to hear Everett defend him,
							or at least palliate his vices— And still more so to hear him say that
								<persRef ref="steele-richard">Steele’s</persRef> papers in the
							Spectator were as loose in morals, as any thing of Byron’s— I gave my
							opinion of the licentiousness of Byron’s poetry, and its immorality; but
							said I was not disposed to judge him more severely than he had judged
							himself— <persRef ref="wells-john">John Welles</persRef> came out with
							me from Joys, and told me, he was glad I had given my opinion so
							explicitly— Not having heard in the course of the day from <persRef
