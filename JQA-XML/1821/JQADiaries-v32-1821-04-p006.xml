						<p><date>V:45.</date> Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> at the Bath-Room. His
							text was Philippians IV:6. “Be careful for Nothing: but in every thing
							by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made
							known unto God.” The Discourse was intelligent, pious and moral— I could
							not forbear contrasting it with the blank of my last Sunday’s attendance
							at the Quaker Meeting. After returning home I was engaged the remainder
							of the day upon the Diary, excepting the time consumed upon the Mail.
							This always absorbs a considerable portion of the Sunday, in a manner
							quite unsatisfactory to me— The mail is delivered, from one to two
							O’Clock in the afternoon. The reading of the Letters and despatches
							seldom employs less than one hour; often more than two and the
							Newspapers sometimes as much— Unless I set them aside till the Evening,
							I am seldom released from the Sunday’s Mail, before five O’Clock, soon
							after which <pb type="ms" n="7"/>the dinner-bell rings. The relaxation
							from the business of the week is thus scarcely perceptible, and the
							devotion of the day to meditation becomes impossible— <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							came to enquire if I had sent for him— It was a joke passed upon him by
								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>6. V:</date> I received this morning a Note from the <persRef

							Meeting of the Members of the Administration, at Noon— The meeting was
							held accordingly— All present except <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>. The confidential Note
							of the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de Neuville</persRef>
							was the subject of consideration. It is a very long and sophistical
							defence of the <persRef ref="edon-unknown">Captain</persRef> of the
							Apollon; an elaborate argument in support of the assertion in a former
							Note that a great error had been committed, meaning by the American
							Government, and a final declaration that upon his conscience he thinks
							that no arrangement of commercial interests between France and the
							United States can take place until this error shall have been
							acknowledged and repaired— This peremptory demand of an acknowledgment
							of error, on one point as a condition precedent to an agreement upon
							another, was of course deemed inadmissible by us all. But it was thought
							by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> that it was de Neuville’s intention to break off
							the negotiation upon this point so that it might not have to the world
							the appearance of breaking off upon the others; especially the
							Navigation question— The President inclined to the opinion that de
							Neuville had indulged his passion; and that he would not be supported in
							the ground he has taken, even by his own Government— My own opinion is
							that de Neuville finds himself personally implicated in this discussion—
							He told me that the merchants in France had made enquiries of the Royal
							Council of Commerce, whether they might come to Amelia-Island, and S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s River, and transact their business
							with the United States without being subjected to the Tonnage duties;
							and the Council by his advice had answered that they might. This I
							believe to be the principal cause of the temper which he displays on
							this occasion. But I observed that this Letter was confidential— That if
							I should now answer it, as it deserves, he might complain of unfair
							usage— He might say that being confidential, if there was any thing
							exceptionable in it, I should have made it known by a verbal and
							friendly remonstrance; upon which he might have withdrawn his Letter, or
							altered it so as to render it entirely inoffensive. I therefore proposed
							that I should write him a short Note inviting <pb type="ms" n="9"/>him
							to suspend for the present this discussion; and it was so determined. I
							accordingly wrote it, and in the Evening received his reply, which was
							brought to my house by <persRef ref="thierry-fb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thierry</persRef> of the French
							Legation— He consents to the suspension, with the understanding that he
							is to render his confidential note of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.
								</hi>inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> official, at his option— He
							desired me to give Thierry a verbal answer— I accepted the proposal and
							told Thierry that the note would be considered either confidential or
							official at his the Baron’s pleasure.</p>

							all this a diminution to be reciprocal of one third of the tonnage
							duties direct and indirect on both sides. I told him it was impossible
							we should ever come to an agreement upon such terms. He asked then that

							might agree to an Article for restoring Deserter Seamen; that we might
							consent to a diminution of duties upon French Articles, but that for all

									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the Attorney General— The subject
							considered was the draught by the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary
								of War</persRef>, of Instructions to <persRef ref="preston-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> the
							Commissioner under the Treaty recently concluded with the Creek Indians,
							for ascertaining the amount of losses by certain Citizens of the State
							of Georgia, by the depredations of the Creeks, indemnity for which is
							stipulated by this Treaty— The Instructions are long, and embrace a
							variety of objects not familiar to my mind; referring to all the former
							Treaties with the Creeks, the provisions of which were not familiar to
							my recollection. Numerous limitations were prescribed to the extent of
							the demands to be received, and the nature, and forms of authentication
							of the Evidence to be admitted were pointed out. I took little part in
							this deliberation with the foundation of which I was not sufficiently
							conversant to form a considerate opinion, except with regard to one
							question which occurred— Many of the losses occurred from twenty to
							thirty years back. And most of them consisted of negro Slaves and
							cattle. The question is whether the claim of indemnity shall be allowed
							not only for the losses themselves, but for their increase by
							propagation, or for interest upon their value— There was much discussion
							of this question. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> observing that
							neither the sufferers nor the people of Georgia would be satisfied with
							the indemnity unless the allowance should be made. But it was observed
							to be scarcely possible to fix any rate of allowance on this account—
							The increase of the Cattle could not possibly be ascertained, that of
							the Slaves was almost as inaccessible. A rate of interest upon the value
							would be very <pb type="ms" n="11"/>difficult to fix, and after all
							would operate very unequally. If interest at six per Cent should be
							allowed on the assumed value the claim for interest in many of the cases
							would amount to double the value and more of the original claim— The sum
							appropriated being limited would in all probability be found inadequate
							to the payment of the claims, with this allowance, and then it must be
							apportioned in a very unequal manner, some claimants losing only a part
							of the interest and the others a part of their principal. I suggested
							that the allowance of interest in such cases had not heretofore been
							usual or at least had always been subject to modification, and referred
							specially to the 3 per Cent Stock created by <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton’s</persRef> system, from the interest which at the time was
							due on the debt to be funded. I cited this to prove that the practice of
							the Government had been to consider interest, even when promised by
							contract, more under the controul of the Government than the principal.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford denied that there was any
							such discrimination in Hamilton’s funding act. He said that it divided
							the whole debt then existing principal and interest into three parts,
							funding one third of it at 6. per Cent interest payable immediately, one
							third in deferred Stock, upon which interest was to commence at 6 per
							Cent after ten years, and one third at 3 per Cent immediately. I think
							it a duty to treat M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford with
							delicacy— As I had referred to the funding act, merely to illustrate the
							principle, and as I thought it would mortify him to have the book
							produced in the face of his denial, I did not insist upon, or prove the
							position I had assumed. I urged however the danger to the Government of
							admitting as a principle that upon claims of indemnity the demand for
							interest or increase rests upon the same or as strong grounds as that
							for the principal— It was finally concluded that the Instruction should
							be to ascertain separately the amount of actual loss, and that of claim
							for interest or increase. To make provision first for the former, and if
							a balance of the public appropriation should be left, to take the claim
							for interest into further consideration— Another point of long
							discussion for the Instructions was relative to the mode of
							authenticating the testimony. This turned much upon the internal
							organization of the State of Georgia, and the Constitution of her County
							Courts— It was chiefly between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun— The Meeting was continued
							till five O’Clock, and the President directed another meeting to-morrow
							at half past One O’Clock to take into Consideration the <persRef

						<p><date>12. V:</date><persRef ref="schee-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Schee</persRef> was again this morning at the Office— He
							is to take passage in the frigate Constitution, now about to sail from
							Boston to the Mediterranean, and I informed him there would be no
							occasion for him to remain longer here on account of the project of a
							Treaty with the <persRef ref="charlesfelix">king of Sardinia</persRef>—
							I submitted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schee’s Letter concerning it
							to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> who did not think
							it an object worth much waste of time. The Cabinet Meeting at the
							President’s was held and the substance of the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de Neuville’s</persRef> verbal
							proposals for a commercial Convention was discussed— They are proposals
							upon which it is utterly impossible to expect any arrangement— He
							demands a reduction of duties upon French wines imported into this
							Country; a reduction of duties upon French Silks, or an increase upon
							China Silks— A Consular Convention upon the basis of that of 1788. and a
							reduction of the duties upon merchandize imported into the United States
							and for all this he offers a reduction, which he says under no
							circumstance whatever can exceed the amount of one third, upon the
							extra-duties upon Cotton, potash, rice and tobacco, when imported <pb
								type="ms" n="12"/>in American vessels, into France. This reduction
							would still leave a prohibitory duty upon the importation of American
							Articles in American vessels. Examining his proposals in detail, it was
							thought that the reduction of duties upon French wines might be
							accepted, as well as the alternative either of reducing the duties upon
							French silks or of increasing them upon those of India— To this however
							I suggested some objections— The difference of quality and of price
							between French &amp; India silks is so great that even prohibitory
							duties upon the latter would scarcely increase the consumption of the
							former— Our importation of silks from India and China is now very great.
							It forms a large portion of our commerce, and especially of the commerce
							the most profitable to those who are engaged in it— To break it up would
							produce extensive dissatisfaction among the merchants. It would also
							dissatisfy the people of the Countries from which we receive the India
							silks. As to China, we need not much concern ourselves how the people
							there would take it; but in India, our trade is with people under
							British dominion— Its continuence is dependant upon British good will,
							and although they have no right to object to our increasing the duties
							upon it, I think we should soon feel the effects of their displeasure.
							These opinions however met no concurrence— It was insisted that we had
							an unquestionable right to impose the duties—that no Nation had a right
							to take offence at it, and it was presumed that none would. That the
							India and China trade though profitable to individuals was not so to the
							Nation, and that it would be good policy to burthen it with heavy
							duties. With regard to the Consular Convention, it was thought advisable
							to agree to that part also of the Baron’s proposals— I observed that the
							Consular Convention had always been unpopular in this Country— And
							always a favourite instrument of influence to France— I recurred to the
							History of that Consular Convention, and to the able and elaborate
							report of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay to the old Congress against
							it. The President said he had been a member of the old Congress when
							that Report of <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jay’s</persRef> was made; that he remembered it well, and had been
							against the Convention— But it might be revived with modifications which
							would avoid its objectionable parts— After accepting all these demands
							it was concluded that we should demand in return the revocation (to be
							reciprocal) of all discriminating duties— As it was however understood
							that de Neuville will not agree to this the question was discussed
							whether we should in any event agree to discriminating duties, which
							will operate unequally against us— Hitherto the expressed opinion in the
							administration has been unanimous that we should agree to no such
							principle, but <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> now declared
							himself in favour of it. He also said he had been against the passage of
							the extra-French tonnage Act of 15 May last. This assertion surprized
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> much, and me a little— For although the principle
							of that act was once &amp; again canvassed at Cabinet Meetings, not a
							lisp against it was ever heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford there. But he may have worked underhandedly against it with
							members of the house or of the Committee who reported it. His reasons
							now for agreeing to discriminating duties of unequal operation
							unfavourably to ourselves are that France will consent to no other
							terms. That if the present virtual interdiction of direct commerce in
							French or American vessels should continue, we shall be obliged to pass
							more restrictive Laws like those of embargo times, which he thinks would
							excite great disaffection to the Government and yet prove ineffectual
							for their purpose all which certainly has weight. But when we get
							possession of Florida there will be less occasion for any additional
							restrictive Laws, as there will be less of means for evading those that
							exist. And I insisted that there was neither reason nor justice in this
							demand of France. Its principle was that our Seamen were better
							navigators, and our merchants more skilful in their business than those
							of France; and this demand was that we should join to load with our own
							hands, a burthen upon our own <pb type="ms" n="13"/>people to restore
							the balance. That the same result may be produced by the Laws and
							Ordinances of France, in despite of us, is possible, but we should not
							be chargeable with having subscribed to it ourselves. I asserted that
							the principle of equal reciprocity in our commercial intercourse with
							foreign Nations had been a fundamental maxim of our policy from the time
							of our Declaration of Independence; and although there might have been
							slight occasional deviations from it, there had been none comparable to
							this. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford did not agree with me. He
							cited our own system of discriminating duties, which has been in force
							ever since the year 1790. and asserted that <persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
								>General S. Smith</persRef> of Baltimore was the first who had
							proposed equalizing the duties; and that it was long before he succeeded
							in obtaining the Act of 3. March 1815. I referred to our Treaty with
							France of 6. February 1778. and to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s</persRef> Report to
							Congress of December 1793 in proof of my positions. This discussion was
							finally postponed with the understanding that for the present we are to
							claim a mutual abolition of all discriminating duties— <persRef
								ref="ecky-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef> of
							Philadelphia called this day after dinner at my house. He had two
							objects upon neither of which was it in my power to give him
							satisfaction— One was some old claims upon the Swedish Government, of
							which Ecky was some years since agent for the claimants— The other was
							to apply for some profitable office, of which there are none at my
							disposal. He soon found that his journey from Philadelphia had been to
							no purpose, and left me, certainly discontented— We spent the Evening at

						<p><date>13. V:30.</date> I received this morning a Note from the <persRef

							house before I should see the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron
								de Neuville</persRef>, with whom I had fixed one O’Clock for an
							interview. I went to the President’s accordingly— His object was only to
							mention again the importance which he attached to this Negotiation with
							France— From what has past, he has little expectation that it will
							terminate in a satisfactory arrangements, and he is particularly anxious
							that we should have in the end the advantage of having offered very
							liberal terms— He was therefore disposed to agree to the reduction of
							the duties upon French Articles imported into this Country, and also to
							a Consular Convention properly modified, to which I had yesterday
							appeared to be averse. I told the President I should not object either
							to the reduction of duties on French Articles, <unclear><hi
									rend="strikethrough">duly</hi></unclear> to a Consular
							Convention duly modified. But as the principal object for which France
							wanted the Consular Convention, was for an Article stipulating the
							restoration of deserting Seamen, if we should not agree, for the whole
							Convention, we might for such an Article. I then went to the Office and
							had the proposed conference with the Baron— He set forth his
							propositions— The demand that we should reduce our duties upon French
							wines from 15 Cents a Gallon to 10. Add 40 per Cent to our duties upon
							silks imported from beyond the cape of Good Hope, agree to a consular
							Convention, upon the basis of that of 1788, though with any
							modifications, which we might find expedient; conclude especially an
							article for the restoration of deserting Seamen, repeal the act of 15
							May 1820 and reduce by one third the extra-duty upon French Articles
							imported in French Vessels— In consideration of which, France would
							revoke the king’s ordinance of 26 July 1820, and reduce one fourth of
							her extra duties upon tobacco, rice, potash and Cotton— This would be
							his first proposal; but if all his propositions in favour of the french
							Commerce should be aceeded to, he could extend the reduction of extra
							duties, except upon the Article of Cotton, to one third. He had been
							instructed to keep this concession in reserve: but he did not think
							there was much use in diplomatic mysteries— He preferred giving at once
							the extent of his powers. I desired him to send me a written minute of
							these proposals, upon which I promised to furnish him in a few days with
							a counter-project, but I told him that I saw little prospect of our
							coming to any agreement, with demands so very large and concessions so
							very slender on the part of France— I added that we should be disposed
							to accommodate France as much as possible in <pb type="ms" n="14"/>her
							commercial interests, but that we should call for an entire aboliton on
							both sides of the discriminating duties. He said that was impossible— He
							was not even authorised under any circumstances to agree to a reduction
							of one half—for it was well known, and the calculations had been made
							with the utmost accuracy that the result of a reduction of one half
							would be to throw the whole carriage of the trade into the hands of
							American shipping— France only wanted her share of it, and would agree
							to any terms which would secure even the largest half of it to the
							United States. I told him that besides the general objections to our
							accepting the principle of unequal discriminating duties we were
							satisfied that a reduction of only one third of those of France would
							still leave a prohibitory duty upon our shipping in the Ports of France,
							and that if there must be such a prohibitory duty, we could at least not
							give our acquiescence to it by compact— After he went away I called
							again at the President’s and informed him of the substance of his
							Conversation with me— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

						<p><date>18. V:</date> Snow-Storm, which continued through the day but
							finished with rain— Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>— All the members of the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william;thompson-smith" type="multi"
								>Administration</persRef> were present— The draft of a
							Counter-project for a Convention with France which I had made yesterday
							was considered and discussed— It was thought best, not to present at
							this Stage of the Negotiation the idea of an alternative on the subject,
							that we may make the fair experiment whether we cannot agree upon the
							terms of a Convention— The question was debated whether we could agree
							to the principle demanded by France, of admitting by Treaty
							discriminating duties unequal in their operation, but intended so to
							counterbalance the superiority of our Navigators, that the Carriage of
							one half the trade between the two Countries shall be secured to French
							shipping— We have hitherto unanimously resisted this principle, as
							neither fair in itself, nor just towards our navigators. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> however this day expressed the opinion that it
							would be advisable to admit the principle, so far as may be necessary
							for France to obtain a portion of the carriage of the trade— But I was
							surprized at his asserting that he had been averse to the passage of the
							French tonnage Act of 15 May 1820, and I found upon noticing this
							afterwards to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, that he was not surprized less than myself at
							this avowal. Calhoun said that not only Crawford had never avowed any
							opposition to the Act, at the time of its passage, but if he had, that
							the Act would certainly not have passed. I now insisted strongly against
							the admission by treaty of any unequal stipulations to the disadvantage
							of our own Navigation; observing that it would be a departure from a
							commercial system, equally wise and liberal, deliberately formed, at the
							very birth of our Nation, and entirely congenial to the Spirit of the
							Declaration of Independence— That system was proclaimed to the world, in
							the first Article of our Treaty of 6. February 1778 with France. A
							Treaty, scarcely less remarkable among national compacts than our
							Declaration of Independence was among Acts of National Legislation— It
							proclaimed freedom of Commerce between Nations, as the just Law of
							intercourse between them, and entire reciprocity as its ruling moral
							principle. France had assuredly never before avowed such principles in
							any Treaty, and they were evidently then introduced by the American
							Negotiators— I suppose by <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin</persRef>— They were the
							sound principles of commercial intercourse among Nations, and I was not
							aware that we had materially ever departed from them— The stipulation
							now claimed by France would be a material departure from them, and I was
							apprehensive would involve us in difficulties with other Nations, who if
							we made this concession to France might claim the same for themselves—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun supported these opinions, but
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford thought a mode of
							discrimination might be agreed to which would suit the purposes of
							France without any apparent sacrifice of reciprocity, and without danger
							of involving us with other Nations— The President concluded to make at
							least the experiment of insisting upon full reciprocity, and conformably
							to his determination, I made a second draft <pb type="ms" n="17"/>of a
							Counterprojet to be sent to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean"
								>Baron de Neuville</persRef>; containing the same propositions,
							which I had presented in the draft made yesterday; of advantages to
							France by reduction of the duties upon Wines; by increasing the duties
							upon silks imported from beyond the cape of Good Hope and by a Consular
							Convention, or an Article stipulating the restoration of deserting
							Seamen— But demanding the entire equalization of Tonnage duties, and
							that our Tobacco should be released in France from the monopoly of the
							Régis.</p>

							go, was a reduction of one third. The French Government had reason to

							converse with me on the case of <persRef ref="wilcocke-samuel"
								>Wilcocke</persRef>— From the papers sent me by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning it appears that Wilcocke was
							charged with having absconded from Montreal carrying with him bank-bills
							to a large amount, purloined from a commercial house in which he had
							been a Clerk, that he had escaped first into the State of New-York and
							thence into Vermont. He had been pursued into both States, and finally
							arrested upon a civil suit, at Burlington, by a process returnable to
							the County Court there— To serve this process the <persRef
								ref="ketch-jack">Jack Ketch</persRef> who had come over from
							Montreal after Wilcocke, was made a special Constable, and having once
							arrested him, instead of returning the process to the Court whence it
							had issued he took Wilcocke on board a vessel upon Lake Champlain, and
							after carrying him first to Plattsburg, finally took him into Canada,
							and lodged him in prison at Montreal— There are affidavits of the
							Canadian Officer who arrested him and of the partner of the house who
							pursued him, that after he was taken he consented to go with them, being
							alarmed by information from them, that a woman with whom he had
							cohabited was under prosecution for <pb type="ms" n="19"/>his offence— I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning that if these Affidavits
							were true, we could certainly not be solicitous to rescue such a
							character from merited punishment; but the testimony was ex parte, and
							the question was not upon the merits of the man, but upon the violation
							of our jurisdiction— His consent could not take away that error. Canning
							had nothing valid to reply to this, but after various other palliative
							suggestions he said <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef>, the Consul-General, had intimated to
							him, that there had been a tacit connivence by common consent, to such
								<hi rend="italic">récaptionés</hi>, which was found necessary on
							both sides upon that border, and if there had been such an usage, he
							thought it would be advisable, rather to put an end to it, by giving
							notice on both sides prospectively, than by pressing upon a case which
							has already happened— As the writs upon which Wilcocke was taken at
							Burlington issued from the Office of <persRef ref="griswold-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Griswold</persRef>, now the
							District Attorney, I concluded upon writing to him, before taking any

							Note, proposing to confine our Negotiation entirely to the shipping

							two points of agreement for the basis of a Convention. 1. That the
							discriminating duties on both sides shall be <hi rend="italic"

							parties may share in the carriage of the trade on both sides— I passed

						<p><date>24. VI.</date> There was a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef

							the discriminating duties on both sides should be accepted, with the

							we should consent that the discriminating duties in France, direct or
							indirect, upon our shipping, should be much heavier than those in this
							country upon the French shipping. I repeated my objections to the
							admission of this principle, which I thought could not be done without
							surrendering the broad and liberal principle of reciprocity, upon which
							our whole commercial system from the first organization of our
							Government has been founded. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> contested this
							position, and said that the act of 3. March 1815. had been first
							proposed by <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef> of
							Maryland; that he had proposed it, long before it passed and that he
							could not carry it for a long time because it was thought it would
							operate against us— I answered that the anticipated operation of the act
							of 3. March 1815. must necessarily have been estimated, subject to the
							counteraction of foreign regulations— While the restrictions and
							prohibitions of foreign powers acting upon our trade continued, it might
							be very questionable how an offer of abolishing our discriminating
							duties which might be accepted by some, and rejected by others, would
							work— But reciprocity is the law of Freedom applied to the intercourse
							between Nations, as equal rights form the standard of Freedom in civil
							Society— This great principle was assumed at the very period of our
							Declaration of Independence, and had formed the basis of our commercial
							policy ever since. I well recollected it was contained in a Report of
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> to Congress while he was Secretary of State; and
							all the discriminating duties and restrictions ever introduced into our
							Laws had been merely defensive, to counteract the like restrictions and
							discriminations of others— We had never sanctioned the restrictive
							principle by Treaty, but always reserved to ourselves the power of
							counteraction. Much less had we ever assented to it with the admission
							that it was to operate disadvantageously to ourselves—to cast away
							advantages derived from the superior skill, of our navigators, by our
							own act, like loading with stone the rider of a racehorse to make him as
							heavy as his competitor. But notwithstanding my argument, it was
							determined that we should accept the basis of an unequal discrimination,
							though adhering to an apparent and nominal reciprocity. <persRef

								Gallatin</persRef> has suggested a mode of effecting this, to which

						<p><date>27. V:30—</date><persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Major
								Roberdeau</persRef> came again this morning to the Office, and we
							measured further the Exchequer Standards. We found the Diameter of the

							contents are 2126.0975 inches— The Diameter of the Coal Bushel is 18.64.
							and its depth 8.15. producing of course 2224.2015 inches of cubic
							contents. This is as near as we have been able to ascertain by direct
								<pb type="ms" n="22"/>measurement; and I doubt whether it be
							possible to ascertain nearer than within four or five cubic inches the
							contents of a cylindrical vessel so large as a bushel— I wrote a Note to
							the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister, upon the commercial
							Negotiation, requesting him to specify more particularly the reduction
							of discriminating duties by France and the United States to which he is

							Article of a Convention— I received yesterday a Letter from <persRef
