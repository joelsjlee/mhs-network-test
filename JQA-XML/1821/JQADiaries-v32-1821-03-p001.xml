							Session of Congress obtained an Act of Incorporation by the name of the
							Columbian College. I told them that I regretted that I could not comply
							with their request, for two reasons— One that having declined upon
							Considerations which I had fully explained, subscribing to their
							Institution, I thought I could not with any propriety recommend with my
							name that for which I had not seen fit to give my money— The other was a
							general rule that I had prescribed to myself to give no written
							recommendations of this kind for any thing. I believed that things very
							useful would make their way without needing any recommendation; and if I
							should indulge myself in the practice of giving any recommendations, I
							should be bound to decline them whenever I should not approve the object
							for which the object would be required, or should not have a knowledge
							of its merits— Both these cases would lead to very awkward discussions
							upon special occasions— They led to unpleasant controversy. A general
							rule could give offence to none— These Gentlemen were of course not
							satisfied— Brown was far less urgent than Rice. He said if I had made it
							a general rule to give no written recommendations they could not urge it
							upon me now. Rice said that they had applied to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> who had also declined giving
							a written recommendation; but he had promised to write a private Letter
							to one of them expressing a favourable opinion of their undertaking,
							with permission to them to publish it— Rice further said that they had
							already collected subscriptions sufficient to enable them to open very
							shortly their College—that in a late tour through some of the Southern
							States, he had collected for eight successive weeks upwards of a
							thousand dollars a week; and their prospects were of the most flattering
							success. I told them that their general object the promotion of the
							education of youth had my hearty concurrence and good-wishes, as they
							must have those of every friend of humanity. Upon this they took their
							leave— It was one of those occasions upon which it is not in my nature
							to give graciousness to refusal, and I suppose the chilling coldness of
							my manner was more offensive than the refusal itself. I avoid at least
							with studied intention all displeasing words, but of the forbidding

							nearly two hours in perfect silence— No moving of the Spirit, and I

						<p><date>26. V:</date> I had sent to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> on Saturday Evening my draft of a Letter to the
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> on the claim of France under the Louisiana
							cession Treaty; and I received this Morning a Note from the President,
							directing a Cabinet Meeting at his house at twelve O’Clock this day— It
							was accordingly held; and attended by all the members of the
							Administration except <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the Attorney General,
							who is confined by illness to his house. My draft was a reply to de
							Neuville’s Letter of 6. June 1818. Both were read, and both contain
							elaborate counter-arguments. I requested that my draft might be severely
							scrutinized, particularly with regard to the ground of argument which it
							assumed— The French claim has a strong colour of plausibility, and it
							was important that we should in resisting it take no stand from which we
							might hereafter find it necessary to withdraw— There was no diversity of
							opinion, upon the discussion. There are two untenable points in the
							claim—one that it is broader than the stipulation upon which it is
							founded—the other, that upon a promise of equal favour it claims
							gratuitously that which has been granted to others for an equivalent.
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> made a sound objection to one
							expression in the draft, as too harsh and I immediately altered it— The
							rest was approved. But the Baron de Neuville appears determined to pick
							a quarrel upon another affair— The seizure of the Apollon in S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s river— Although he came without
							any Instructions from his Government on the subject he has repeatedly
							hinted that satisfaction must be given to France concerning it before he
							can agree to any arrangement of a merely commercial interest. He wrote
							me a Note some weeks since to enquire whether another vessel, called the
							Edmond, which grounded in the attempt to enter S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Augustine, and then went and entered as in distress at
							Amelia Island, could there take in a Cargo from the United States
							without being molested— This has led to a correspondence in one Note of
							which de Neuville asserts that a <hi rend="italic">grave error</hi> has
							been committed, referring to the case of the Apollon, and meaning, by
							the American Government— I am to reply also to this Note— The Edmond has
							not been allowed to ship goods from the United States into
							Amelia-Island; but the disposition of the President and most especially
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford is to give up the Apollon—
							She was seized under an order from the Treasury of 6. May 1818. but they
							seem to think that order was not warranted by Law— I think otherwise,
							but the District Attorney in Georgia, <persRef ref="habersham-richard"
								>Habersham</persRef> countenances the opinion that there is no law
							to reach the case. It had been determined after the seizure of the
							Apollon to have the case tried in the District and Circuit Courts, and
							if the decision in them should be against the Government to bring it up
							by appeal to the Supreme Court— The final decision could not have been
							had in less than two or three years, and in the mean time the fraudulent
							use of the Florida <pb type="ms" n="4"/>territory could not have been
							made for evading and defeating the Laws of the Union— The main object of
							this profligate scheme would have been disconcerted, and if the <persRef
								ref="edon-unknown">Captain</persRef> and owners of the Apollon must
							finally be indemnified by the Government, it would cost only a trifling
							sum in comparison with the heavy loss to the public by the success and
							impunity of the project. But since the ratification by Spain of the
							Florida Treaty, the same object will be attained by another process. The
							boundary is transferred from the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s
							to the Sabine river— Florida becomes our own and offers no longer a
							lurking hole for foreign smugglers. There is no motive for keeping the
							decision upon the case of the Apollon suspended; and as the legality of
							the Treasury order of 6. May 1818 is questionable, it was now concluded
							that I should direct the District Attorney in Georgia to dismiss the
							appeal from the decision of the District Court, which was only a decree
							pro forma, and order the restoration of the Apollon to her Captain,
							leaving him to his action against the <persRef ref="clark-archibald"
								>Collector</persRef> for indemnity— I was convinced this would in no
							wise satisfy de Neuville, and only acquiesced in, without approving the
							measure— I am also to enclose to de Neuville copies of the papers
							communicated with my answer to <persRef ref="vives-don">General
								Vives</persRef> on the case of the Apollon.</p>

							at my house with <persRef ref="preston-james">General Preston</persRef>
							of Virginia; who informed me that he was desirous of obtaining hereafter
							an appointment under the general Government. This Gentleman has been
							Governor of the State of Virginia, and might have been a General in the
							Army, but for some question about rank— He has just received a temporary
							appointment as Commissioner under a recent Treaty with the Creek
							Indians, and his intimation to me was that as it was expected <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> did not intend to
							hold long the Office of Governor of the Florida’s, in case of his
							resignation, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston would be willing to
							succeed him— But he said it was as object of peculiar concern to him,
							and which he wished might be considered before any appointment should be
							conferred upon him, that he wished for no office, in which the
							Government should not be entirely satisfied that his services would
							yield to the public an ample equivalent for his appointment— This is
							some thing like asking for a favour and giving notice that it will not
							be received as a favour— Independence asks no favours— It will be woo’d
							and not unsought be won. The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> called at the Office to speak about the
							appointment of the Commissioners under the Florida Treaty— He has given
							up the idea of appointing <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">C. A.
								Rodney</persRef>, and <persRef ref="johnson-chapman">Chapman
								Johnson</persRef>; and now spoke of <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">H.
								Wheaton</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef ref="white-hugh">H. L.
								White</persRef> of Tennessee. He said that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Johnson was fully qualified for the Office, but as the
							recommendations for him and those for <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay</persRef> seemed to have been
							given as in a sort of mutual opposition to each other, he had thought
							best as he did not appoint M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay, to avoid
							also the appointment of his rival. To Wheaton he said the only objection
							was, that he belonged to one of the large cities where the principal
							losses had been sustained— If one Commissioner should be selected from
							one of them, and none from another, the sufferers of the neglected city
							would complain of partiality, and be jealous of the decisions— And he
							asked me if this was not my opinion— I said it was a view of the Subject
							deserving great consideration— But there was also another view of it,
							which should not be passed over— All the difficult questions which will
							be presented for the decision of the Commissioners, will be questions of
							commercial or maritime Law— Questions in which the Lawyers of the large
							Cities are peculiarly conversant, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wheaton probably more than any other man in the Union— The lawyers of
							the interior however learned and well qualified in other respects would
							not be so familiar with that so familiar with that special branch of the
							Law, and for that reason probably their decisions might be less
							satisfactory to the Sufferers— Nor did I think there would be any solid
							reason for complaint if one Commissioner should be taken from one of the
							Cities, and none from the others—the important question would be, the
							qualifications of <pb type="ms" n="5"/>the person selected; and if they
							should be eminently suited to the appointment, as in the case of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheaton they certainly would be, I thought
							the little jealousies of rival cities might safely be disregarded— There
							was a <persRef ref="alvey-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alvey</persRef> came to the Office having a claim upon the Spanish
							Government, for certain provisions taken by force from him for the
							supply of Spanish troops in South-America. <persRef ref="mason-john"
								>General John Mason</persRef> also came, and stating that he was the
							Agent of many claimants under the Florida Treaty requested that he might
							have access to their documents filed in the Department of State: to
							which I assented.</p>

						<p><date>31. VI:</date> A rainy day— <persRef ref="alvey-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alvey</persRef> came again to the
							Office, and was furnished with a Letter, recommending him and his claim
							to <persRef ref="brent-thomas">Thomas L. L. Brent</persRef>, the Charge
							d’Affaires at Madrid— I received a Letter from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> relating to some embarrassing
							applications in behalf of <persRef ref="gracie-william">William
								Gracie</persRef> of New-York. He married <persRef
								ref="gracie-elizabeth">a daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="wolcott-oliver">Oliver Wolcott</persRef> now Governor of
							Connecticut—but she died a year or two since— <persRef
								ref="king-charles">Charles King</persRef>, son of <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">Rufus</persRef> the Senator from New-York, married
								<persRef ref="king-eliza">Gracie’s Sister</persRef>. I received a
							few days ago a Letter from Charles King, saying that Gracie was going to
							France, to pass some time, and expressing the wish that he might be
							attached to the American Legation there; and a Letter from Gracie
							himself offering to take despatches. The President had also received a
							Letter from Governor Wolcott requesting the appointment of Gracie as
							Secretary of Legation, and I have one from him, urging the interposition
							of the Government again in behalf of the claim of <persRef
								ref="gracie-archibald">Archibald Gracie</persRef> and C<hi
								rend="superscript">o.</hi> for the seizure of a vessel and Cargo of
							theirs at Antwerp— The President is apprehensive that both the special
							interposition, and the attaching of Gracie to the Legation at Paris
							would be displeasing to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, and objectionable
							to other claimants upon France, as shewing partial favour to Gracie’s
							claim in preference to others equally well founded— He directs me
							therefore if I give Gracie any Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin to write it with special circumspection; and I wrote to Gracie
							and Gallatin accordingly— I received from the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de Neuville</persRef> a
							Letter in reply to mine upon the Louisiana claim. Without abandoning the
							ground of his first demand, he now assumes another— His first claim was
							that French vessels should be received in the Ports of Louisiana, paying
							no higher duties than British vessels pay in all the Ports of the Union—
							He now claims that if they are not entitled to this, they should at
							least be exempted from the extra-tonnage duty which is not paid by
							Nations with when we have no Treaty— This claim is more plausible but
							not more sound than the other.</p>

							from four to seven O’Clock. The average Five and thirty-six minutes.
							From that time till Noon I am engaged in writing with the interval of an
							hour for breakfast; and almost always an hour or two wasted upon reading
							and assorting Newspapers. The breach in this Diary of four Months and a
							half by the indispensable occupation of the Morning hours upon other
							writing, threatens to be irreparable— Yet I have resumed it, and am
							labouring to retrieve the lost Time— About Noon I repair to my Office,
							where I am employed upon its current business until 6. in the Evening;
							calling when occasion requires at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>; and attending at the Meetings of the Members
							of the Administration there, which are likewise occasional. We dine
							between six and seven, after which I read Newspapers, pay or receive
							neighbourly visits, and now within these few days, revise the proof
							Sheets of my Report upon Weights and Measures. Between ten and eleven is
