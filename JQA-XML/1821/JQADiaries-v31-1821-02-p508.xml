						<p><date>1. VI:</date> Thursday— <persRef ref="trimble-james">Captain
								Trimble</persRef>, a brother of the <persRef ref="trimble-william"

								>Doctor Hamm</persRef>, against whom complaints have been made,
							directly to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, upon
							which it is expected that Hamm will be removed— Trimble is very strongly
							recommended, and has an appearance and manners much in his favour— I
							called at <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef> Office, and gave him an account of the angry
							conferences between <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> and me, on the 26<hi

							second in command under <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Perry</persRef> at
							the celebrated battle on Lake Erie, of September 1813—and heavy
							imputations of misconduct rested upon him at that time. A rankling
							quarrel between Perry and him existed, and was terminated only by
							Perry’s death— In the duel between <persRef ref="barron-james"
								>Barron</persRef> and <persRef ref="decatur-stephen"
								>Decatur</persRef> last March, Elliott was Barron’s Second, and
							strong rumours were circulated that Elliott prevented an accommodation

							at Kalorama has just published a pamphlet, containing Letters and

							Perry to him, written shortly before Perry last sailed from this
							Country, and a copy of which he left with Decatur— Elliott has published
							a Letter in defence of himself— The public opinion is divided concerning
							him; but on the whole favours him more than circumstances wilol warrant—

							Senator from Connecticut, and chairman of the Committee of civil list
							retrenchment. That Committee last Wednesday asked to be discharged from
							the further consideration of the subject which had been referred to
							them, which was refused by a vote of 19 to 14— They then reported that
							it was not expedient at the present time to reduce the Salaries of the
							Executive Officers, or of Members of Congress— This report now lies on
							the table for Consideration— Dana expecting that it will be debated
							before the close of the Session came for further information concerning
							the arrangement of the business of the Department, which I gave him— I
							told him that effectually to perform the business of the Department, I
							wanted one or two additional Clerks, and I should greatly regret if the
							Salaries of those now employed in it should be reduced— I observed that
							the whole amount of the reduction which could be made upon them would be
							a mere drop in the bucket— That all the considerable appropriations at
							the disposal of the Department of State had been applied with such
							regard to economy, that the balances of the two former years would be
							amply sufficient to cover the expenditures of the present; and the items
							of Contingent expenses of foreign intercourse, of relief for distressed
							Seamen, and of intercourse with the Barbary Powers may be struck out of
							the Estimates for the service of the present year, unless the balances
							of the last two years should be carried to the surplus fund, for which
							there is a bill before the House of Representatives— Dana said if I
							should have time he would wish me to draw up a statement of these
							circumstances in writing— He intimated that his own opinion was against
							any reduction, and that it was on his part disinterested, as it could
							not hereafter personally affect himself— His term of service expires
							with the present Congress, and <persRef ref="boardman-elijah">another
								Senator</persRef> is already elected for the next six years in his
							place— Dana, in the Senate, and <persRef ref="moseley-jonathan"
								>Moseley</persRef> in the House are the last remnants of the federal
							Representatives of Connecticut in Congress— The Steady Habits for which
							the people of that State were so long noted have given way to the
							democratical spirit of change— The new members from Connecticut in
							Congress are not equal in point of talents to their predecessors— Nor
							will the loss of Dana, easily be supplied— He has been twenty years in a
							minority, almost always a very small minority, by which in this Country
							no measure of great public utility can be carried through— But in the
							detail of business he has always been a useful and intelligent member,
							and his influence in both houses has always been considerable— I
							attended this Evening the Meeting of the Columbian Institute—the amended
							petition to Congress for a Lottery was read, but on further
							consideration it was resolved not to be expedient to present it at this
							time. <persRef ref="kinsey-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>4. VIII:15.</date> About one O’Clock this morning I was awakened by
							a noise stirring in the house, and the light in the chamber was so great
							that I thought it was day-light— After a few minutes, my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> opened the door and said there was
							a fire in the neighbourhood, and he thought it was the War-Office— I
							immediately started from bed, dressed myself and went out— On coming to
							the first cross street and looking in the direction of the fire, it
							appeared to me decidedly to be the Building of the Department of State
							itself, and I passed two or three of the most distressing minutes of my
							life. When I got however to the end of the street I found the building
							of the Department unhurt— The fire was consuming a brick house on the
							other side of the Street, and immediately opposite the Eastern end of
							the Public Building— There was <pb type="ms" n="510"/>nothing but the
							Street between them, and there might still be danger to the Office. I
							went to the house of <persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. Forrest</persRef>, and roused him
							up to be at hand in case of need— I then went to the building of the
							Department where I found <persRef ref="boyd-rb">Boyd</persRef> the
							watchman— I went immediately to my own chamber which is at the
							South-East corner of the building, and was directly opposite to the
							fire, and remained there, till the roof of the house on fire fell in,
							and the flames became so confined with the walls which remained standing
							that the building of the Department was entirely free from danger— I
							then returned home between four and five of the morning and retired
							again to bed— It was therefore between eight and nine when I rose for
							the day. I attended Church at the Capitol, and heard <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>
							the Unitarian preach from Psalm VIII:5 “For thou hast made him a little
							lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.” It
							was a Sermon upon the dignity of human Nature; a good Sermon, but not
							equal to what I should have expected. The specification of that in which
							the glory and honour of man consisted was neither so full nor so exact
							as it might have been. Man as a physical being is but a little higher
							than the beasts of the field— It is only by his intellectual nature that
							he is a little lower than the Angels— The glory of man therefore
							consists in the cultivation of his intellectual faculties; all the rest
							is mere appurtenance to animal nature— The Law of his existence being
							the improvement of his condition, and being also a gregarious animal,
							the duty which arises from his condition, is the cultivation of his
							intellectual faculties for the improvement of his individual and social
							condition— To the attainment of this end the powers of man are great;
							and his success has been splendid— But the moral to be drawn from the
							capacities of man, should be exhortation and not astonishment— Whatever
							has been done, there is always more to do. The glory and honour of man
							is <hi rend="italic">toil</hi>, for the good of his kind— We had a short
							visit from <persRef ref="eustis-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eustis</persRef>— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

						<p><date>5. VI:</date><persRef ref="winder-william-henry">General
								Winder</persRef> called this morning at the Office, wishing to

							consented— The time has now come when our <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2" type="multi">two eldest
								Sons</persRef> must again leave us to return to their studies at
							Cambridge— The winter vacation closes this week; and they are preparing

								Ironside</persRef>, at his house last Summer, but since our removal
							he has attended at my house. But as Charles is now so far advanced in

							would best complete his preparatory studies at Cambridge. I was this day
							preparing Instructions for George, for transacting some business which I
							propose entrusting to him. I received despatches from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> at Paris; from 19 September to 25. October.
							relating to the commercial negotiation with France, to the Florida

							suspended the commercial negotiation at Paris on the plea that they
							consider the adjustment of an absurd claim which they have set up under
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Louisiana cession
							Treaty as indispensably connected with it. And they have appointed
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								de Neuville</persRef> as <hi rend="italic">Ambassador</hi> to
							Brazil; but with a Power, first to come here, and conclude if possible
							the commercial negotiation with us— He left Paris, to embark in a
							Frigate at Rochefort, the first week in November; and as three Months
							have already elapsed since that time, there would at any other Season of
							the year, be cause for some anxiety for his safety. But with the
							unusually rigorous winter which we have had here, there has been its
							ordinary correspondence of strong and steady westerly winds blowing
							across the Atlantic Ocean. The same delay occurs to the arrival of the
							ratification of the Florida Treaty— The fact of the ratification has now
							been known to us nearly two Months— <persRef ref="vives-don">General
								Vivés</persRef> has notice that the <persRef ref="debarros-manuel"
								>Messenger</persRef> who brings it left Madrid the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th: </hi>of October to embark at Bordeaux, also
							the first week in November— There is great impatience in the public here
							for its arrival— But no vessels from Europe have lately come in, but
							after very long passages; one vessel fifty days after soundings on the
							Grand Bank of Newfoundland— Another thirty days after having been in
							sight of the Boston Light-house— I wait therefore with composure, though
							any accident which should prevent the arrival of the Florida Treaty
							during the present Session of Congress might have very <pb type="ms"

									>r</hi> John Rhea</persRef>, of Tennessee called at my House
							this morning, and spoke of a nephew of his whom he supposed to be on
							board of some vessel of the American Squadron in the Mediterranean.
							While he was here, I recollected a summons received two days since from
							the Secretary of the Treasury to attend a Meeting of the Commissioners
							of the sinking fund at the Committee Room of the Senate at the Capitol
							this morning at 11. O’Clock. It was then past eleven—and I immediately
							ordered my Carriage, and took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhea with
							me to the Capitol. It was Noon when we got there, and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> who had been some time waiting, was on the point
							of going away without having the Meeting— It was attended only by him,
								<persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gaillard</persRef> the President pro Tempore of the Senate— The
							usual yearly Statements of the board, which had been prepared by the
								<persRef ref="nourse-joseph">Register of the Treasury</persRef> were
							read, and the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Board— The
							repayments of public debt during the year 1820. have been about half a
							Million of Dollars less than the money borrowed— Two copies of the
							Report of the Commissioners, one for each house, were signed, and the
							Meeting was over in half an hour— I went for a few minutes into the Hall
							of the Senate, and finding them occupied upon business of little public
							interest, passed into the House of Representatives, where they were
							debating upon the General Appropriation Bill; and particularly upon a
							motion made by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, for an Appropriation of an outfit and Salary for a
							Minister to any Independent Government of South-America— This has been
							Clay’s principal instrument of opposition to <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							administration, through the whole of his first Presidential term. He has
							not succeeded in any part of it; but as there has always been a portion
							of popular sentiment in favour of his projects, and as the flouting
							Canvassers in the House are of his side, he has kept the ball up, at
							every one of the four Sessions— Towards the close of the last Session he
							obtained a vote by a majority of four or five that such an appropriation
							ought to be made. He now moved that the appropriation should be made as
							an Amendment to the general Bill— It was opposed, principally by
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef>— I heard several speeches on the question, pro and
							con; but the question was not taken— After leaving the house I went to
							the Office of the Register of Deeds, and presented two Deeds to be
							recorded; one of the Estate which I purchased of <persRef
								ref="way-andrew;way-andrew2" type="multi">the Way’s</persRef> in F.
							Street, where I now live; and the other of the Square 592. which I
							brought of <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef>— I was
							surprized to be told that it was too late to record either of them; the
							Law of the District, being that of Maryland, requiring that all Deeds of
							Real Estate should be recorded within six Calendar Months from their
							dates— The unceasing pressure of public business has prevented me from
							delivering these Deeds in Season— I asked at the Office how the case
							would have been if either of the Grantors of my deeds had died in the
							interval, and was told that I should have been obliged to file a Bill in
							Chancery— I attended at my Office, merely to receive the Letters by
							Mail— Our weekly Evening party was very fully attended, and the dancing
							Hall was crowded.</p>

							Tracy</persRef>, and <persRef ref="allen-nathaniel">Nathanael
								Allen</persRef>, members of the House of Representatives, from the
							State of New-York called this morning at the Office, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy remarked that they had already come
							there six times before without being able to find me. They came for two
							purposes. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy shewed me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef>, at Albany,
							stating that they had applied to the <persRef
								ref="morris-thomas;livingston-john" type="multi">Marshals of the two
								Districts of New-York</persRef>, for copies of their returns of the
							Census, not yet made to the Department of State; that one of the
							Marshals had objected to giving copies unless authorised to do so; by
							the Secretary of State; and Spencer requested Tracy to call upon me, and
							Apply for an order to the Marshals to give the copies— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy that I had doubts of my own
							authority to order the Marshals to give copies of their returns to any
							one. But I would look into the Act of Congress for taking the Census,
							and send him a written answer— The other object of enquiry to these
							Gentlemen was the reason of the change of one of the newspapers, in <pb
								type="ms" n="512"/>the State of New-York, in which the Laws of
							Congress are printed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy said he had a
							Letter from the publisher of the Ontario Messenger, expressing some
							uneasiness rather in sorrow than in anger that the printing of the Laws
							had been transferred from his paper to another— He having been appointed
							seven or eight years since, and having been ardent and zealous in the
							cause of the Country during the War with England; and not being
							conscious of having given any cause of Offence to the Government. I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy that the cause of the change
							had been a memorial which I received last Summer, signed by a number of
							the Inhabitants of the Western part of New-York, assigning several
							reasons which had appeared to me to be sufficient for making the change—
							The chief of which were, that the Batavia Times was a paper better
							suited by its location, for the convenience of that part of the State,
							as well as a paper of better appearance, and of more circulation, than
							the Ontario Messenger— I shewed them the Memorial— Tracy said he knew
							all the subscribers, and they were persons of very respectable
							character— But he and Allen had some conversation between themselves
							about one of them whom they supposed to have been the writer of the
							memorial— I then observed that the <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt"
								>Governor of New-York</persRef>, in his explanatory message to the
							Legislature, in support of a charge which he had previously made against
							the Officers of the General Government, of interfering improperly
							against him in the State-Elections, had thought proper to mention this
							incident of the change of newspapers, and that of the continuance of two
							others, hostile to him, among his proofs— The fact was that the change
							had been made not only after the late election was decided, but after
							Governor Clinton had made his denunciation. The fact also was that I had
							always continued the Printers of the Laws, as I found they had been
							before I came into the Department of State, excepting where there were
							special reasons for a change. When I came into the Office, I found two
							of the New-York papers which printed the Laws friendly to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton, and one opposed to him— I had
							continued them all till the present year. The Albany Argus, from being
							the friend had indeed become the adversary to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clinton; but if I had dismissed the paper for that reason,
							it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have been the very improper interference
							in the politics of New-York, of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clinton complained. I had shewn them the memorial upon which I had
							changed the Ontario Messenger for the Batavia Times— But I should be
							perfectly explicit with them—I had the more readily yielded to the
							arguments of the memorial, not because the Ontario Messenger had been
							friendly to Governor Clinton, but because it was invariably and bitterly
							hostile to the administration of the General Government— The papers that
							printed the Laws, were perfectly at Liberty to promulgate what political
							sentiments they pleased, but I felt no obligation to countenance papers
							whose career was a succession of Slanders and invectives upon the
							Government of the Union— Tracy was not ashamed to say that he had never
							remarked that the Ontario Messenger was unfriendly to the General
							Government, but Allen was a little more ingenuous— He said that since
							the Missouri-question had been agitated, there had been some things in
							the paper against the Administration— They left me, I believe not well
							satisfied with the result of their visit— The Ontario Messenger, is
							reputed to be the property of John C. Spencer; or at least is entirely

						<p><date>10. VII:</date><persRef ref="palmer-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Palmer</persRef>, a member of the
							Senate from Vermont, came to converse with me, concerning the
							appointment of a District Attorney in that State— The Commission of the
							present Attorney <persRef ref="hutchinson-titus">T. Hutchinson</persRef>
							is about to expire, and I received some time since a recommendation
							signed by several members of the Vermont delegation, recommending a
								<persRef ref="griswold-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Griswold</persRef> for the new appointment. There was no formal
							complaint against Hutchinson, and some days since I received strong
							Letters recommending the re-appointment of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hutchinson, from <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van
								Ness</persRef> the Ghent Treaty Commissioner and from <persRef
								ref="allen-heman2">Herman Allen</persRef> the Marshal. I spoke on the
							subject last Thursday to <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mallary</persRef> whom I found
							bitterly adverse to Hutchinson— In the course of the Conversation he
							said the Vermont delegation were unanimously against his re-appointment,
							to which I answered, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unanimously. For one of
							the members from the House, <persRef ref="crafts-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crafts</persRef>, had enclosed to me
							the recommendatory Letters of Van Ness and Allen, with a subsidiary
							though ambiguously expressed recommendation of his own— Upon hearing me
							say, that the Vermont delegation were not <hi rend="italic"
								>unanimous</hi><pb type="ms" n="514"/>against Hutchinson, Mallary
							appeared to be much surprized, but I did not tell him who it was, that
							differed from the rest. He did however suspect Crafts, and it appears
							called upon him yesterday for an explanation— Palmer told me that Crafts
							had spoken to him on the subject, and told him that he did not intend
							his Letter to me for a recommendation— I sent for the Letter and read it
							to Palmer, who said it was a little more recommendatory, than M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crafts upon his recollection appeared to
							have considered it. Crafts had been unwilling to disoblige M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ness and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Allen, and therefore had written what he might himself think
							was not a recommendation though it was natural that I should have taken
							it for one, the complaints against Hutchinson are that he exercises his
							office in an oppressive manner, particularly with regard to the exaction
							of fees. Of this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Palmer told me various
							circumstances which left no doubt of the propriety of appointing another
							person— I observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Palmer that the
								<persRef ref="tichenor-isaac">other Vermont Senator</persRef>, had
							mentioned another person than Griswold as more suitable for the
							appointment because he resided in the other division of the State— He
							had said it was usual in the distribution of Offices there, to keep some
							proportion between the Residents on the two sides of the Mountains; and
							as the <persRef ref="paine-elijah">District judge</persRef>, the Marshal
							and the revenue Officers, were now all Inhabitants of one division, it
							would be desirable, that the District Attorney should be from the other—
							Palmer objected to this, as a contracted principle; said that the person
							named by Tichenor was not so well suited for the Office as Griswold, and
							urged that it was of more import to the public, that the District
							Attorney should reside near the Judge and Marshal than with the
							Mountains interposed between them— With this opinion, my own coincided—
								<persRef ref="harris-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> S. D.
								Harris</persRef> of Boston, came to the Office— He came as a
							Messenger to bring the electoral presidential votes of Massachusetts,
							and is now a Candidate for the appointment of Marshal of that District,
							vacated by the recent Death of <persRef ref="prince-james">James
								Prince</persRef>. <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>
							the Spanish Minister came and informed me that <persRef
								ref="debarros-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Barros</persRef> had just arrived with the Florida Treaty, ratified
							by the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>— He said he
							had been so anxious to give me the first notice of this Event himself
							that he had not even waited to open his despatches but had hastened here
							without losing one moment of time— I was much gratified with this mark
							of attention from the General, and made him my acknowledgments for it—
							He said he would make me a communication on Monday. Barros came, in the
							Rapid from Bordeaux for Philadelphia, and landed from the vessel at
							Wilmington Delaware. He had a passage of more than <hi
								rend="strikethrough">eighty</hi> 88. days. I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> and informed him of the
							arrival of the Treaty—an occurrence which gave him great
							satisfaction.</p>

								ref="kean-edmund">Kean</persRef> the English tragedian, who is now
							performing at Philadelphia— He is the popular favourite of the day in
							England; but he is of that Class of Actors, described by <persRef
								ref="hamlet">Hamlet</persRef>, as tearing a Passion to tatters. His
							vice is exaggeration, and it is the vice of almost all the Literature of
							the Age— I have never seen upon the English Stage a male performer of
							the highest order—none to compare with what I conceive <persRef
								ref="garrick-david">Garrick</persRef> to have been. None to compare
							with what I have seen performed by <persRef ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi

								ref="jordan-dorthea">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Jordan</persRef>, and <persRef ref="farren-elizabeth">Miss

							than Kean in England, yet in his delineations of character, I cannot
							divest myself of the impression produced by the likeness of a
							caricature— He is a mannerist, and there is consequently great
							opposition of opinion upon his style of acting—those who like it, are
							enthusiastic in their <pb type="ms" n="515"/>admiration; those who
							dislike it, are disgusted with the actor— There is no neutrality
							concerning him, but however questionable his talents may otherwise be,
							there is no doubt that he has that of drawing crowded houses— Kean
							arrived from England last November at New-York, where he performed
							several times, and is now going through an engagement at Philadelphia—
							We had also some talk upon the business now before Congress— The House
							of Representatives after rejecting various propositions concerning the
							admission of Missouri, at last on the motion of <persRef

							appointed a Committee of thirteen members to consider and report upon

							take a deep interest in the success of the Independent Cause, and will
							support the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> whenever he
							shall think proper to recognize the Independence of any of the

						<p><date>12. VI:</date><persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, the
							Spanish Minister this morning, by Note requested an interview with me,
							and I answered him by fixing one O’Clock, for the purpose. He
							accordingly then came and delivered to me the Treaty of 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> February 1819. ratified by the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>, which he declared he
							was ready to exchange with me for the ratification of the United States—
							He added, that in delivering this ratification to me, he was instructed
							by his Government to state, that the Cortès, upon receiving from the
							King, the communication of the Treaty, had observed with great
							mortification and pain, that besides the alienation of valuable
							Provinces of the Spanish Monarchy, of which it required their sanction,
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">the Spanish negotiator</persRef> of the
							Treaty, had left altogether unprovided for, and had renounced, all the
							just claims of Spanish Subjects upon the United States, for which
							indemnity had been stipulated by the Convention of 1802. That with
							regard to the question which had arisen relating to the grants of Lands
							made by the King, prior to the time specified, in the eighth Article of
							the Treaty, the 24<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of January 1818, as it
							appeared to have arisen from a misapprehension between the negotiators
							of the Treaty, it seemed to the Cortes that such adjustment of it was
							equitably due to Spain, as was usual in <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi>
							cases, namely, that the <hi rend="italic">property</hi> of the lands in
							the ceded territories should be divided equally between the two parties—
							That in presenting the Treaty with the ratification, he was instructed
							to make these observations with the request that they might be submitted
							to the consideration of the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> of the United States, with the hope, that he
							would see, in the proceedings of the Spanish Government the earnestness
							of their desire to consummate the adjustment of all the differences
							between the two countries; and he was instructed to add, that, as by the
							recent changes in the Government of Spain, the principles of Government
							upon which the Constitutions of the two Nations are founded were
							analogous, it was hoped that this ratification would be received as an
							earnest of the desire of Spain that the ties of intercourse and the
							political relations between them might be drawn together in the closest
							harmony— I answered him, that I should forthwith make report to the
							President of the communication of the Treaty, as ratified by the
							Government of Spain; that this ratification, having been given after the
							expiration of the six Months, stipulated by one of the Articles as the
							term within which the ratifications should be exchanged, would be
							submitted to the Senate of the United States, for their advice and
							consent to receive it in exchange for the ratification of the U. States
							heretofore given; that if this Sanction of the Senate should be granted,
							I should give him notice of my readiness to exchange the ratifications
							with him; that I should also report to the President, the observations
							which by order of his Government, he had now made to me; that I was well
							assured he would receive with great satisfaction the assent of the
							Cortes to the ratification of the Treaty, as an evidence of their
							disposition to cultivate and cherish the friendly and harmonious
							intercourse between the two Countries; <pb type="ms" n="516"/>a
							disposition which on the part of the President, would meet with the most
							cordial return— That with regard to the unfavourable opinion which he
							had been instructed to say, the Cortès had entertained of the Treaty as
							it affected the interests of Spain, I should now only take the Liberty
							to observe that it had always been considered by the President as a fair
							and liberal adjustment of the differences between the two Countries, and
							in which full justice had been done to the interests of Spain; that if
							the claims of Spanish Subjects upon the United States provided for by
							the Convention of 1802. had been abandoned, the amount of the claims of
							Citizens of the United States upon the Government of Spain, was much
							greater than the sum which the United States had consented to accept for
							the remuneration of them—that in all arrangements of this nature, mutual
							concession was an indispensable ingredient, and that in this Treaty, we
							believed there had been, on the part of the United States not less of
							this concession than on the part of Spain; That with respect to the
							grants of Land, I was happy to be relieved from the necessity of
							re-entering upon a painful discussion, which had already been entirely
							exhausted; that as the total nullity of the grants, asserted by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, before the signature of the Treaty
							was now confirmed by the solemn sanction of the Cortes, I hoped it would
							be unnecessary for me to show, that there had been no misapprehension by
							him concerning it— That we had been informed, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Onis had published in Spain a book, or a pamphlet giving an
							account of his Mission to this Country, and particularly of that
							negotiation—that I had not seen it, but from what I had heard of it,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, though he had been far from
							doing justice to the American Government, had nevertheless admitted that
							he signed the Treaty with the full understanding that all the grants in
							question were null and void under it and insisted with great force that
							the Treaty, even thus made, was in the highest degree advantageous to
							Spain— That as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, <persRef
								ref="perezdecastro-evaristo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perez de
								Castro</persRef>, had urged in an official note to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							all that the Cortes had wished should be said by the Spanish Government
							on this subject, and had been answered by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth, I presumed there would be no occasion for a further discussion
							of it here—that, at all events, no new disposition of the Lands, nor any
							other alteration of the Treaty could possibly be made, without another
							Negotiation and another Treaty— He said that, for that, he had neither
							Instructions nor authority: on the contrary, his orders were merely to
							submit the observations which he had made to me, and to present the
							ratification of the Treaty, which contained, as had been desired by the
							American Government, an express declaration of the annulment of the
							grants: that he did not even think it necessary to commit these
							observations to writing, but as there had been intimations abroad, as if
							the Spanish Government were insidiously intending to protract the
							conclusion of this negotiation, he had now brought the ratified Treaty
							with him, and would be at any time ready to receive our ratification in
							return— He had also received the Royal Order to the <persRef
								ref="cajigal-juan">Governor, and Captain General of the Island of
								Cuba</persRef>, for the delivery of the ceded territories— That, it
							was true, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, with a view to defend
							himself from the imputation of having yielded too much in the Treaty,
							had published an account of the negotiation, of which he, General Vivés,
							spoke with regret— He had not received a copy of it, but had heard with
							concern of its contents. (I understood him as intending by these remarks
							to express his concern at the acrimonious manner, in which Onis is said
							to have made mention in his book of the members of the American
							Government)—that if he should receive a copy of it, he would communicate
							it to me. He added that immediately after the Exchange of the
							Ratifications, he should be ready to take every measure necessary for
							transmitting the order to the Governor General of Cuba for the delivery
							of the Province of Florida, conformably to the terms of the Treaty— He
							then took leave and withdrew leaving the Treaty with the Spanish
							Ratification at the Office, in my possession. <pb type="ms" n="517"/>I
							went immediately over to the President’s, and informed him of this
							communication from General Vivés. He desired me to prepare the draft of
							a message to the Senate, for their advice and consent to the exchange of
							the ratifications— There was some question as to the form of the
							message; whether it would be proper to propose a new ratification by the
							Senate, or simply their advice and consent to receive the Spanish
							ratification in exchange for the ratification of the United States,
							heretofore given— I thought the letter to be the proper and consistent
							form, and so the President directed it should be. Vivés had told me that
							he had been furnished with authentic copies of the Grants to <persRef
								ref="alagon-unknown">Alagon</persRef>, <persRef ref="punonrostro"
								>Puñon-Rostro</persRef> and <persRef ref="vargas-pedro"
								>Vargas</persRef>; and as they are expressly referred to, and
							declared null and void by the Spanish Ratification, I thought it would
							be best to publish them with the Treaty, and with the sanction of the
							President determined to send to Vives for them— The President requested
							me also, to draw up a written statement of what had passed between Vives
							and me at our interview this day to be communicated with the other
							papers to the Senate. The President also put into my hands a long
							written memorial to him, which <persRef ref="meade-richard">R. W.
								Meade</persRef> had delivered to him this morning, and which he said
							he had not had time to read— On reading it, I found it was nothing less
							than an attempt, to set up a claim that if the Senate should now ratify
							the Treaty, they would make it conditional, that the whole of a claim of
							more than half a million of dollars of Meade’s upon the Spanish
							Government, should be paid, as liquidated long since the signature of
							the Treaty, or that a particular renunciation of claim in one of the
							Articles, should be excepted from the ratification; or that they should
							declare the United States to have assumed the whole amount of his claim—
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> the Editor of the
							National Intelligencer had hinted to me some days since that Meade was
							intriguing mischievously among the members of the Senate, against the
							Treaty; but this Memorial is a <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, sprung upon
							it, at the last moment— Meade had never made a shadow of a claim like
							this, and now instead of presenting it directly in a memorial to the
							Senate, or in regular form to the President, through the Department of
							State, addresses and delivers it to the President in person—there was
							something very insidious in this course of proceeding— There were
							statements in the memorial, relative to myself, not founded in fact. By
							addressing it directly to the President, it appeared to be drawn up with
							a view to take post for complaint against him if he should not
							communicate it to the Senate before they should act upon the Treaty, and
							if he did communicate it that it should be without any corrective of its
							mis-statements— There was malice and treachery in the transaction as
							well as intrigue and cupidity. After a cursory reading of the paper, I
							told the President, that I thought it should be communicated to the
							Senate with the Treaty— But that it must not go without a comment— If he
							would refer it to me, I would make a formal, though it must be a very
							hasty and short Report upon it to him, which he might communicate with
							it to the Senate. To this the President assented— I took the papers
							home, and was occupied till midnight upon them. I prepared drafts of two
							Messages to the Senate; one to communicate the Treaty, and the other
							Meade’s Memorial. On examining this I found it contained with some bold
							misstatements of facts a subtle, and delusive comment upon them, with a
							very elaborate and plausible argument upon principles of general and
							National Law, which it insisted was applicable to the case— I saw there
							was no time for a regular answer to this argument, nor even to examine
							and canvass the principles which were referred to as authorities from
							the writers on the Law of Nations— I wrote therefore without consulting
							a single book a Report to the President, directly contradicting the
							falsehoods alledged in the memorial as facts, and barely glancing at the
							particular point of the argument where its fallacy was lurking,
							referring explicitly to the intelligence of the Senate of the United
							States for its entire detection— I postponed till the morning the
							drawing up of the memorandum of the Conference between General Vivés and
							me.— This was <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef>
							birthday—in which she entered upon her 47<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>year. She attended a Ball given at the Navy-yard Barracks.</p>

								>President’s</persRef> I met <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, who told me he was

							had just arrived in the Steam-Boat from Norfolk. <persRef
								ref="thierry-fb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thierry</persRef> came in the course of the day with a message to
							enquire if I could receive him, which I answered that I should be happy
							to do, immediately— He came, and informed me that in consequence of
							certain difficulties which had arisen in the negotiation concerning the
							commercial relations between France, and the United States, with which
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> had been charged, the French Government had
							concluded that the arrangement might be facilitated by transferring it
							to this place. It had therefore been committed to him, and in the short
							time he was to remain here (having a further destination elsewhere) he
							hoped we might agree upon terms, which would restore the interrupted
							commercial intercourse between the two Countries— I answered him in
							general terms expressive of the satisfaction with which his return to
							this Country would be welcomed by the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>—of our own earnest desire to settle upon
							principles of reciprocity our commercial relations with France, and of
							my own personal gratification in having the opportunity to discuss them
							with him, whose conciliatory dispositions towards the United States, so
							well corresponded with ours towards France. He requested me to take the
							President’s directions, as to the time when he would receive him, and
							when he might present to him the persons attached to his Legation; and
							enquired whether he should write me a note to ask a conference with me
							on the subject of his mission— I desired him to write a line to ask the
							Audience of the President; but told him I myself should be happy to
							receive him and confer with him at any time, without giving him the
							trouble to ask it in writing— He spoke of the seizure of the French ship
							Apollon, <persRef ref="edon-unknown">Captain Edon</persRef> seized last
							Summer at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s in Georgia: a case,
							with the particulars of which he said he was not acquainted— The
							information of it had reached Paris after he left that City, and had
							come to his knowledge only the day before he sailed. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Roth, had spoken to him of it here; and
							from the representations which he had received of it, there seemed to be
							circumstances of aggravation attending it— I said that the vessel was
							under seizure for a violation of our revenue Laws; and the case was
							before the competent Court for trial— That I had not pursued the
							correspondence on the subject with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roth,
							because by the communications relating to it, received from him, I found
							his zeal had in it so much of heat, that I had preferred communicating
							with the French Government concerning it, through M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin— I had sent him Instructions to
							give all the necessary explanations, and transmitted to him proofs of a
							conspiracy for defrauding the Laws and Revenue of the United States,
							between this Captain Edon, a <persRef ref="clarke-unknown">Spanish
								Vice-Consul</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s, and
							the Governor of <persRef ref="coppinger-jose">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Augustine</persRef>, Coppinger— I would communicate
							these papers to him—and as by the cession of Florida to the United
							States, now ratified by the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of
								Spain</persRef>, no future case of the same kind could arise, I
							trusted we should find no difficulty in settling this affair to mutual
							satisfaction— He repeated that he knew nothing of the particulars, but
							said it had been even represented to him, as if the honour of the French
							flag had been lightly treated— I said he might be sure there was no such
							intention; and observed that there could have been no possible motive in
							the officers concerned in the seizure to insult the French flag— He
							seemed sensible that he was under some irritation, and waved the
							subject, saying that he would make further enquiry into the facts, and
							would duly consider the documents that I offered to shew him— He soon
							after, took leave— With this new thread to unravel, I was no less
							occupied with that of the Florida Treaty— The message communicating it,
							and that to be sent with <persRef ref="meade-richard">Meade’s</persRef>
							Memorial, were signed by the President— The Memorandum of my conference
							yesterday with <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> was
							copied, and the despatches from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, relating to the <pb
								type="ms" n="519"/>Spanish Ratification were selected— I read to the
							President my Report to him upon Meade’s Memorial, which he approved— But
							I felt great anxiety concerning it; not only as going in the nature of a
							controversial document to the Senate, but as having undoubtedly to come
							hereafter before the public, and committing the Government to the
							assertion of certain principles, which will be much debated— After the
							paper was copied, I sent to the Offices of the Secretaries of War and
							the Navy, requesting them to meet me at the President’s— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							had already left his Office, but I found <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> at the
							President’s. At my request he read the Report, and found nothing in it,
							but what he thought maintainable and correct in principle— It was
							therefore sent to the Senate, with the Messages; but that body had
							adjourned before <persRef ref="monroe-james2">Lieutenant
								Monroe</persRef> reached the Capitol with them— They will be
							delivered to the Senate to-morrow Morning— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams’s</persRef> weekly tea-party was very fully attended this
							Evening; and it ended with dancing, which she had not intended— Congress
							are very busily occupied— Yesterday the House of Representatives
							rejected the Report of their Committee of thirteen; and the Resolution
							which had passed the Senate for the admission of Missouri— This day
							after a reconsideration, upon motion of a member who had voted with the
							majority of the rejecting resolution of yesterday, the question was
							again taken upon the Resolution for Admission from the Senate, and it
							was again rejected by a vote of 86 to 80— This day also, the Report of a
							joint Committee of both Houses was made, with regard to the manner of
							counting the votes of the Presidential election to-morrow— And as it is
							expected that objection will be made to receiving the votes of Missouri,
							a Resolution is proposed that in such case the result of the election
							shall be announced in alternative so as to avoid the question upon the
							reception of the votes—</p>

						<p><date>14. VI:30.</date> I received a Note from <persRef

							the Senator from Louisiana— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> being unwell could
							not go— There was much conversation upon the proceedings in the House of
							Representatives which were said to have been extremely violent and
							disorderly. The two houses met in convention to open the electoral
							Votes, and to declare the persons chosen as President and Vice-President
							for the four years ensuing the third of March next. They met in the Hall
							of the House of Representatives, and proceeded in regular form,
							according to the mode prescribed by the Constitution of the United
							States, the Law of 1. March 1792. that of 26 March 1804 and the joint
							Resolution reported by the Committee of the two Houses, (which had
							however been accepted by the House of Representatives only this morning,
							after sharp debate, and twice taking of yeas and nays) till the votes of
							Missouri, came to be counted—when <persRef ref="livermore-arthur">Arthur
								Livermore</persRef>, a member from New-Hampshire rose and objected
							to the counting of the votes of Missouri, because Missouri is not a
							State of this Union— Immediately <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> and <persRef ref="floyd-john">John
								Floyd</persRef>, both members from Virginia started up together, and
							began to speak— <persRef ref="williams-john">John Williams</persRef> a
							Senator from Tennessee then moved that the Senate should withdraw to
							their own chamber which they did. A measure well devised to defeat the
							impetuosity of the unruly members of the House— The House then became
							exceedingly tumultuous— Floyd in the face of the Resolution adopted upon
							the Report of the joint-Committee, by a large majority of the House,
							moved that Missouri <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one of the States of this
							Union, and that her votes ought to be received and counted— After much
							disturbance and confusion, <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> got
							rid of this Resolution by moving that it should lie on the table; and
							then moving that a message be sent to the Senate informing them that the
							House were <hi rend="italic">now</hi> ready to proceed in continuing the
							enumeration of the of the electoral votes according to the joint
							Resolution— The Senate accordingly returned; the votes of Missouri were
							counted, and the result was declared by the <persRef ref="gaillard-john"
								>President of the Senate</persRef> in the alternative— That if the
							votes of Missouri were counted there would be 231 votes for James Monroe
							as President, and 218 votes for <pb type="ms" n="520"/><persRef
								ref="tompkins-daniel">Daniel D. Tompkins</persRef> as Vice
							President; and if not counted that there would be 228 votes for James
							Monroe as President, and 215 for Daniel D. Tompkins as Vice-President;
							but that in either event they were both elected to their respective
							Offices. He therefore declared them to be so elected— The two Houses
							then separated and the Senate again returned to their chamber; upon
							which Randolph moved in the House moved two Resolutions— One, that the
							electoral votes had been counted, of the State of Missouri, and formed a
							part of the majorities by which the President and Vice-President had
							been elected— And the other, that the result of the election had not
							been declared by the presiding officer conformably to the Constitution
							and the Law, and therefore that the whole proceedings had been irregular
							and illegal— This motion after a very disorderly debate was disposed of
							by a motion which was carried to adjourn— Floyd and Randolph, were for
							bringing Missouri into the Union by Storm, and for bullying the majority
							of the House into a minority— The only result produced by them was
							disorder and tumult— Clay who has infinitely more pliability, <hi
								rend="italic">dodged</hi> the question, and succeeded in making both
							houses of Congress <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> it with him— But among
							the means of his success was one of those disingenuous tricks by which
							he carried the Missouri question, last winter— Then, it was by
							superseding as Speaker, a motion of John Randolph to reconsider a vote
							of the preceding day, on a point of order to give time for the reading
							of the Journal; and directing <persRef ref="dougherty-thomas">the
								Clerk</persRef>, in that interval to carry the Resolution, passed
							the preceding day to the Senate, so that when after the reading of the
								<hi rend="strikethrough">Resolution</hi> Journal, Randolph renewed
							his motion to reconsider, it could not be received, the Resolution being
							no longer in possession of the House— This day it was by reporting to
							the House the Resolution from the joint Committee of both Houses, for
							the proceedings on the presidential election, differently from what it
							had been agreed to in the Committee and adopted by the Senate— The real
							Resolution was that at the joint meeting “the President of the Senate
							should be the presiding Officer”— Clay of his own head altered the
							Report of the joint Resolution to the House, to read “the President of
							the Senate shall be the presiding Officer of the Senate, seated on the
							right of the Speaker of the House, who shall be the presiding officer of
							the House,” and so the Resolution passed the House— It neither did nor
							could have so passed the Senate. But this was Clay’s expedient of <hi
								rend="italic">dodging</hi> that question of collision between the
							two Houses with regard to the presiding Officer— And it is one of the
							pregnant evidences of Clay’s overbearing influence, that this
							unprincipled fraud although discovered and noticed in the house was
							neither censured there, nor resented by the Senate— Floyd, and Randolph
							continued to interrupt the proceedings even after the Senate came the
							second time into joint meeting <hi rend="strikethrough">the second
								time</hi>; but Clay by mere dint of superior influence with his own
							which was also their party finally baffled them and put them down— The
							business of the day was accomplished— The President and Vice-President
							of the ensuing Presidential term were declared; but if the election had
							been a contested one, and the reception or rejection of the Missouri
							votes would have turned the scale, I think there would have been no
							declaration of a President and Vice-President before the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of March, and the whole Union would have
							been unhinged— This was the ninth Presidential election, since the
							existence of the present Constitution of the United States, and is
							already the second instance of a crisis in the election— On former
							occasion it happened at the very tug of conflict between two national
							parties for the mastery. Now it happened, at an aera far more
							extraordinary— When that party conflict had performed its entire
							revolution and that unanimity of choice which began with <persRef
								ref="washington-george">George Washington</persRef> had come round
							again in the person of James Monroe. In the survey of our national
							history this latter unanimity is much more remarkable than the first— To
							this last unanimity there is the exception of a single vote given by
								<persRef ref="plumer-william">William Plumer</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire, and that vote, to my surprize and mortification was for
							me. If there was an electoral vote in the Union which I thought sure for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, it was that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer— I deeply regretted the loss of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer’s vote, because it implied his
							disapprobation of the principles of Administration and although by
							giving the vote for me, he obviously exempted my share in the
							administration from any essential portion of the censure, I could take
							no pleasure in that approbation, <pb type="ms" n="521"/>which though
							bestowed on me, was denied to the whole Administration. My earnest
							desire has been that the Administration should be prosperous and
							satisfactory to the Nation, and in this no consideration relative to
							myself has entered; other than the anxiety to discharge faithfully my
							own portion of the public duty— The conduct of the Administration has
							been upon the whole wise, honest and patriotic; and it has been blessed
							with good Fortune; for which I can never be sufficiently grateful. Its
							great trials however are reserved for its ensuing term of four years.
							Its dangers are in its internal divisions; which have been hitherto
							partly disguised and concealed, and which a happy current of Events has
							overborne— They are now becoming manifest, and assuming a formidable
							aspect. May an overruling Providence turn them eventually to the welfare
							of the Country; and the improvement of public happiness and virtue— The
							Messages from the President, with the Spanish Ratification of the
							Florida Treaty, and with <persRef ref="meade-richard">Meade’s</persRef>
							Memorial, and my Report upon it were received by the Senate this
							Morning— Meade in the mean time had printed his memorial, with
							alterations from that which he had presented to the President, and with
							an appendage of citations from writers on the Laws of Nations, and
							distributed copies to every member of the Senate— He also sent several
							copies of the printed Memorial, to the President; and one to the
							Department of State, with a Letter noticing the corrections made in it
							of the Manuscript Memorial—</p>

								Hersant</persRef>, the Baron’s private Secretary. He addressed the

							peculiar satisfaction with which the <persRef ref="louis-xviii"
								>King</persRef>, at the time anticipated as certain the Event now
							consummated by the wisdom and gratitude of the People of this Union,
							whose unanimity in the re-election of their chief-magistrate was not
							only a just testimonial of the sense which they entertained of his
							public services, but a sentiment in which the suffrages of all foreign
							Nations concurred with theirs. He was expressly charged by the King to
							assure the President of the Satisfaction which he took in this Event,
							and, he the Baron himself, felt a peculiar gratification in the hope
							that the moment of his return to this Country, signalized by this
							harmony and universal confidence of the American Nation, in their
							Government, would be no less propitious to the good Understanding and
							cordial friendship between the United States and France, which it was
							the most imperious of his duties, and the dearest of his inclinations to
							promote— The President answered this speech with simplicity and
							propriety, without noticing any of its personal allusions to himself or
							to the election— He said that the American Nation and Government
							retained a sentiment of peculiar regard and attachment to those of
							France— That we remembered with grateful feelings the assistance which
							we had received from France, and from <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis the
									16<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi></persRef>that we had always
							taken an interest of kindness in the Events affecting the welfare and
							happiness of France since that time— That we should continue to take
							such an interest, and should always be gratified in hearing of her
							prosperity. That we welcomed with much pleasure his return to this
							Country; and had heard with satisfaction of the new tokens of <hi

							his Sovereign— And that our earnest desire being to cultivate the
							Friendship of France, we hoped that the relations between the two
							Countries would <pb type="ms" n="522"/>be adjusted to the mutual
							satisfaction of both. And he then passed to enquiries concerning his
							voyage, and his family. The Audience was of not more than ten minutes
							duration. As he went away the Baron asked me to appoint a time when I

							to-morrow at one O’Clock. Half an hour after his audience I called at

						<p><date>16. VII:</date><persRef ref="burwell-william">William A.
								Burwell</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							Virginia, died this Morning. He had been once for a short time private
							Secretary to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> during his presidency; and soon
							after, was elected a member of Congress, when little beyond the age
							necessary for qualification. He was always re-elected, and has been
							fourteen years a member— He was a man of moderate talents and
							respectable private character— Full of Virginian principles and
							prejudices, a mixture of wisdom and Quixotism, which has done some good
							and much mischief to the Union. Burwell took no lead in any thing— He
							scarcely ever spoke— Never originated a measure of any public utility;
							but fancied himself a guardian of the Liberties of the people against
							executive encroachments. His delight was the consciousness of his own
							independence; and he thought it heroic virtue, to ask no favours— He
							therefore never associated with any member of the Executive, and would
							have shuddered at the thought of going to the Drawing Room— Jealousy of
							State rights and jealousy of the executive, were the two pillars of
							Burwell’s political fabric, because they are the prevailing popular
							doctrines in Virginia— He floated down the stream of time with the
							current, and always had the satisfaction of being in his own eyes, a
							pure and incorruptible Patriot. Virginia teems with this brood more than
							any other State in the Union; and they are far from being the worst men
							among us— Such men occasionally render service to the nation by
							preventing harm; but they are quite as apt to prevent good; and they
							never do any— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burwell was much esteemed
							as a man, and <persRef ref="preston-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Preston</persRef>, heretofore Governor of Virginia, who
							called at my house this morning, spoke of him with great respect and
							tenderness— The <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron de
								Neuville</persRef> came to the Office, at one O’Clock, and brought
							with him, his full-power to treat upon the commercial relations between
							France, and the United States— I desired him to send me a copy of it,
							and told him the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would
							doubtless authorize by a corresponding full power some person or persons
							to negotiate with him— We entered little into Conversation upon the
							subjects of the Negotiation— He said that the reason for which his
							Government had sent him here was that <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had received
							no Instructions relating to the claim of France under the eighth Article
							of the Louisiana cession Treaty; that they were specially desirous of
							having an answer to his Letter on the subject to me, of<space/>June
							1818. that if the American Government assented to the views presented in
							his Letter there would be no need of further discussion concerning it—
							If they did not the reasons would be assigned for their dissent, and it
							would not be difficult to come to an understanding upon it— France was
							not tenacious of the thing itself, and <pb type="ms" n="523"/>would show
							an accommodating Spirit in the negotiation— When he left France he had
							supposed that this would be the only difficulty in the way of an
							arrangement; but with these cases of the Apollon and Eugene, he did not
							know what to do— I told him that I should at an early day give him the
							answer on the Louisiana cession claim— That the cases of the Apollon and
							Eugene could not form any serious obstacle to our agreement— They were
							cases which could not again recur— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin had been instructed to give his Government all necessary
							explanations relating to them; and if he felt any repugnance in
							proceeding to treat of the other points, we might suspend our
							conferences until we should hear further from France; as there was no
							prospect that we should be able to conclude any Convention, before the
							close of the present Session of Congress. He said he hoped we might— It
							seemed to him the easiest thing in the world— I told him I heartily
							wished it might prove so; but the ideas of the two Governments on the
							points of difference between them were so wide apart that I dared not
							even indulge a hope that they could so easily be brought together— He
							said they might begin by repealing on both sides the new and burdensome
							regulations— The law of 15 May and the king’s ordinance of 26. July
							last— That I told him was impossible; it would only put us in the same
							condition which rendered the law of 15. May necessary. However any
							proposals which he should be disposed to make, would be received with
							the most friendly attention by the President. He then left me and soon
							after sent me a Copy of his Full power—which I took to the President— He
							directed me to have a power made out for myself, for the negotiation.— I

							preach at the Capitol, from Romans XI:25. “For I would not brethren,
							that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in
							your own conceits.”— It was a well written, and ingenious discourse;
							chiefly occupied however with a discussion of the meaning of the term
							mystery, as used in various passages of the new testament— It shewed
							that the meanings were various, but did not elucidate the particular
							meaning that it bears in the text— The mystery was, how it happened that
							the Jews, whom as one of them, <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> was in
							religion bound to believe the chosen people of God, should be cast away
							for their disbelief in Christ and his resurrection, while the Gentiles,
							considered in the Jewish Scriptures as reprobates from God, obtained the
							grace of election. The doctrine of Paul in this and the two preceding
							chapters is 1.—That <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Israel, is not cast away,
							but that a portion of them believe and are saved—2. That the other and
							larger portion were blinded and hardened in unbelief by divine
							sufferance to the end that the Gentiles might be converted to the faith
							and partake of the blessings of Christianity. 3. That by this conversion
							of the Gentiles the hardened remnant of Israel will be provoked to
							emulation, and thereby brought again into the fold, so that in the end
								<hi rend="italic">all</hi> Israel will be saved— This is the
							mystery, of which Paul tells the Gentiles, he would not have them to be
							ignorant, lest they should be wise in their own conceits— And Paul
							according to his usual manner argues all this, by reasoning, by
							illustration of imagery, and by quotations of authority from the Old
							Testament. But he leaves unexplained the mystery, why the rejection of
							the Jews should be necessary to the conversion of the Gentiles, and how
							the conversion of the Gentiles should effect the restoration of the
							Jews— After Church, I paid a visit to <persRef ref="lowndes-william"

							the re-appointment of <persRef ref="huntington-hezekiah"
								>Huntington</persRef> as District Attorney for Connecticut. The
							prospect of a change, the necessity for which had been urged on the
							ground of this officer’s incompetency, has brought forward strong
							representations in his support— Tomlinson had received a Letter
							alledging circumstances which if true would have rendered the
							re-appointment of Huntington improper. The nomination had therefore been
							suspended, until Tomlinson should write to his correspondent requiring
							more certain and particular information concerning the facts alledged—
							He has received the reply which contradicts the statement unfavourable
							to Huntington, and the Connecticut delegation are now nearly unanimous
							in wishing for his re-appointment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres
							came to renew the demand for the acknowledgment of the Colombian
							Republic— He is about returning to Philadelphia, and his visit now, was
							instigated by the Resolution which the persevering importunity of
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> obtained from the House of Representatives, a
							Resolution sufficiently illustrated by the refusal of the same house the
							day before to make the Appropriation for <pb type="ms" n="525"/>which he
							had moved. I asked Torres if he had any new Instructions to demand this
							recognition. He said he had not. I then told him that I would
							communicate his demand to the President, but it would be proper for him
							to address me a Note concerning it in writing— And as it was made
							without new Instructions, the President would probably wait for the
							result of the Negotiation which followed the recent Armistice between
								<persRef ref="bolivar-simon">President Bolivar</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="morillo-pablo">General Morillo</persRef>— It was to be
							hoped that Spain herself in the issue of that negotiation would
							recognize the independence of Colombia, and it might then be recognized
							by other powers without their giving cause of complaint to Spain. Torres
							renewed also his demand for a supply of muskets upon loan, but I told
							him that besides the objections heretofore stated to him against it,
							first that it was not in the power of the executive to yield it without
							an Act of Congress, and secondly that it would be a breach of
							neutrality, there was every reason now to expect that the muskets would
							not be wanted; for since the new changes of Government in Spain it could
							scarcely be doubted that this armistice would be followed by a permanent
							pacification. Torres said he did not know how that might be, but as his
							orders were to ask for muskets, he must always have it in his power to
							tell them that he did ask for them— With this intimation, that the
							motive of his present application was merely to enable him to make a
							despatch, he left me— <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> and Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Harris were also at the Office; both
							concerning the appointment of a Marshal for the District of
							Massachusetts— <persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> R. Forrest</persRef> came and told me that <persRef
								ref="meade-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. W.
								Meade</persRef> had spoken to him in the street, and said he had
							been told by a member of the Senate that I had made a report to that
							body against his memorial; and that he seemed to think it extraordinary,
							that a copy of it had not been communicated to him— I told Forrest that
							I had no objection to Meade’s having a copy of the Report; but Meade had
							addressed his Memorial not to the Department of State; nor through the
							Department to the President— He had gone with his Memorial, directly to
							the President, without giving notice of it to the Department— The
							President had referred it to me for a Report which I had made to him in
							the discharge of my duty; but it had been no part of my duty to furnish
							Meade a copy of it— I was at the President’s, when <persRef
								ref="gale-joseph">Gales</persRef> the Editor of the National
							Intelligencer came in, and announced that the vote advising the
							Ratification of the Florida Treaty, had just passed in the Senate with
							only four dissenting voices; and he was exceedingly anxious to have a
							copy of the Treaty, to publish in his paper to-morrow. I told him that
							would be impossible, for the ratifications could scarcely be exchanged
							to morrow; and when exchanged, two copies must be made out, with a
							proclamation of the President to be communicated to the two Houses of
							Congress; all which would take two or three days; but that there would
							be nothing new to the Public in the Treaty, which had already been
							communicated to Congress, and published with the Congressional documents
							last year. And from them it had been republished in the National
							Intelligencer itself and many other Newspapers. Gales said this had
							escaped his recollection, and declared himself satisfied— While I was
							with the President <persRef ref="cutts-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Cutts</persRef> the Secretary of the Senate came
							in with their Resolution, advising to the Ratification, but drawn up in
							a special form, differing from that which had been presented as the
							question in the Message from the President— The Treaty had been ratified
							by and with the advice and Consent of the Senate—on the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of February, but the last Article
							stipulated that the Ratifications should be given on both sides and
							exchanged within six Months from the date— As the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> withheld his
							ratification beyond that period, the United States were no longer bound
							to accept it after the expiration of the time, and when it was ratified
							the question arose whether the tardy ratification should be accepted by
							us. By the Letter of the Constitution it was perhaps not necessary to
							submit this question to the Senate; but the disposition of the President
							is to consult them, whenever, there is any plausible Constitutional
							motive for so doing, and, I was especially desirous that the sense of
							the Senate should again be deliberately taken upon the Merits of <pb
								type="ms" n="526"/>the Treaty, because a continued, systematic and
							laborious effort has been making by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							and his partizans to make it unpopular— In the pursuit of this project,
							Resolutions against the Treaty have been introduced into the
							Legislatures of Kentucky and of Louisiana, and the Western Newspapers
							have been indefatigably filled with Essays and Dissertations to the same
							effect— Among the rest <persRef ref="robertson-thomas">T. B.
								Robertson</persRef>, Governor of Louisiana, one of Clay’s puppets
							made an attack upon the Treaty in his Speech to the Legislature— After
							two years of this work, I was glad to see how the Senate would vote upon
							the Treaty when brought before them again— But the question in the
							President’s Message, was for their advice and consent to receive the
							Spanish ratification in exchange for that of the United States
							heretofore given— From mere inattention to the form of the question in
							the Message; and not from any objection to it, they took the other
							course, of an advice and consent to a second ratification of the Treaty—
							And against this there were only four votes—<persRef ref="brown-james"
								>Brown</persRef>, of Louisiana, who married <persRef
								ref="brown-nancy">a Sister</persRef> of <persRef ref="clay-lucretia"
								>Clay’s wife</persRef>. <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Richard M.

							with hatred of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>;
							and <persRef ref="trimble-william">Trimble</persRef> of Ohio, for some
							maggot in the brain, the cause of which I do not yet perfectly know. At
							the ratification of the Treaty two years ago there was no formal
							opposition made; but the real opposition was greater to it than now— On
							this event, I will not attempt to describe my feelings.— With <persRef

						<p><date>20. VII.</date> There was a meeting of the members of the
							Administration at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>—
							The subjects to be considered were, the proceedings to be adopted after
							the ratification of the Florida-Treaty; and the course to be pursued in
							regard to the Negotiation with France. At the former ratification of the
							Treaty there was an Act of Congress, authorizing the President to take
							possession of the Territory, and to make arrangements for its
							Government, until the end of the then next Session of Congress— The Act
							was contingent, to take effect on the exchange of the ratifications. But
							its operation was limited to a time now past, and another Act has now
							become necessary— Copies of the Treaty must therefore be communicated to
							both houses of Congress; with the Proclamation of the President
							declaring it to be the Law of the Land. The drafts of a ratification and
							of a proclamation are to be made— The appropriation must be larger than
							that of the former act— The President thought it would be advisable to
							have the draft of an Act prepared— But I reminded him of the invidious
							comment of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> two years ago, because <persRef ref="holmes-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef> the Chairman
							then of the Committee on foreign Affairs, had merely consulted me, upon
							the drawing up of the Act; and the petty satisfaction he had obtained of
							reducing the appropriation, from thirty to twenty thousand dollars, by a
							sneer at Holmes, for proposing a sum at the instigation of an Executive
							Officer— As the same Spirit, would be very likely to shew itself again
							on this occasion, I advised that the Committee of the House should be
							left to themselves for drafting their Act— There was some consideration
							of the appointments of Commissioners for the adjustment of the claims.
							The candidates are numerous, and their pretensions various— They were
							variously canvassed, and finally the President desired me to have a list
							made out of all the applications that have been made for Office, in
							Florida, or under the Treaty, with the names of all the persons
							recommending them, to be considered hereafter— As to the Negotiation
							with <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								de Neuville</persRef>, the question now chiefly discussed was
							whether we could agree to any arrangement of the navigating question, by
							admitting that <pb type="ms" n="527"/>American vessels should be more
							heavily burdened with discriminating duties in France, than French
							vessels in the United States. We had hitherto explicitly rejected every
							proposal for such a basis; but <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> now declared
							himself in favour of agreeing to it; and to my astonishment, said that
							he had been against the French-tonnage act of 15. May 1820— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> was not less astonished at this
							declaration than myself— For if Crawford had objected to that act, it
							would not have passed— He never at any of the executive meetings gave
							the most distant insinuation of having any objection to it— His
							opposition was therefore, behind the curtain— Just as it was in the
							whole affair of the Seminole War, and <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							was earnest against the admission of a discriminating principle avowedly
							unfavourable to ourselves, and I was thus inclined also— The President
							is for considering the subject further. <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Wirt</persRef> was not present at this meeting, being engaged in
							attendance at the Supreme Court— <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> was at the Office, again upon the subject of
							the petition for a remission of forfeiture; and the Baron Hyde de
							Neuville, with whom I had some further Conversation upon the Objects of
							his Mission— He harps upon the cases of the Apollon and Eugene, while at
							the same time he says he is willing to leave them to be settled in
							France. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							with me next Sunday and to finish our conversation before dinner; to
							which he agreed. General Dearborn told me that he had taken advantage of
							a season of comparative leisure, when there was not much to do in his

							being now useless.— I prepared a draft of the ratification to be signed

							gives anxious occupation when so much depends upon unerring exactness,

							language. One of the three originals of the Treaty executed by me and
							Onis, was sent to the Printers, to be printed from, for the copies with

						<p><date>22. V:45.</date> Ratifications of the Florida Treaty—exchanged.
								<persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>, came according to

							with <persRef ref="salmon-hilario">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salmon</persRef> his Secretary of Legation. Our preparations were
							not entirely completed when he came, but were ready within half an hour.
							I then took the Treaty with the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of
								Spain’s</persRef> ratification, myself—the General took the Treaty
							with the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> Ratification,
								<persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ironside</persRef> held one of the Originals executed by me and
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef>; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Salmon another—
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> held the printed copy with the President’s
							proclamation. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Salmon read from the
							original in his hand, the Treaty; all the rest comparing their
							respective copies as he proceeded— I read in like manner the English,
							from the Treaty which we retain, with the Spanish ratification—both the
							ratifications were then examined and found correct. The triplicate
							certificates of the Exchange were then signed and sealed, observing the
							alternative precedence of signature, as had been done with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis— General Vivés and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Salmon then withdrew, taking with them the
							Treaty ratified by the President, and leaving that with the Ratification
							of the King of Spain— I went immediately to the President’s— He signed
							the Proclamation of the ratified Treaty—and the Messages to the two
							Houses communicating it to them, as proclaimed— The Messages were sent,
							and that to the House of Representatives, was received while the House
							were in Session. The Senate had just adjourned when <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef> who carried the Message reached the capital. I
							sent at the same time to both Houses the Report upon Weights and
							Measures, prepared, conformably to a Resolution of the Senate of 3.
							March 1817. and one of the House of Representatives of the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of December 1819— And thus have
							terminated, blessed be God, two of the most memorable transactions of my
							life— This day two years have elapsed since the Florida Treaty was
							signed. Let my Sons if they ever consult this record of their father’s
							life, turn back to the reflections on the journal of that day—let them
							meditate upon all the vicissitudes which have befallen the Treaty and of
							which this Diary bears witness, in the interval between that day and
							this— Let them remark the workings of private interests, of perfidious
							fraud, of sordid intrigues, of royal treachery, of malignant rivalry and
							of envy masked with patriotism, playing to and fro across the atlantic
							into each others hands, all combined to destroy this Treaty between the
							signature and the ratification; and let them learn to put their trust in
							the overruling Providence of God. I considered the signature of the
							Treaty as the most important event of my life— It was an event of
							magnitude in the History of this Union. The apparent conclusion of the
							Negotiation, had been greatly and unexpectedly advantageous to this
							Country. It had at once disconcerted and stimulated my personal
							antagonists and rivals. It promised well for my reputation in the public
							opinion— Under the petals of this garland of roses the Scapin Onis had
							hidden a viper. His mock sickness, his use of <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">de Neuville</persRef> as a tool to
							perpetrate a fraud, which he did not dare attempt to carry through,
							himself, his doubts dealing before and after the signature, his
							fraudulent declarations to me, and his shuffling equivocations here and
							in Spain to acquire the reputation of having duped the President and me,
							were but materials in the hands of my enemies, to dose me with poison
							extracted from the laurels of the Treaty itself— An ambiguity of date,
							which I had suffered to escape my notice at the signature of the Treaty,
							amply guarded against by the phraseology of the Article, but leaving
							room to chicanery for a mere colourable question, was the handle, upon
							which the king of Spain, his rapacious favourites, and American
							swindling land jobbers, in conjunction withheld the ratification of the
							Treaty, while <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and his admirers
							here were <pb type="ms" n="529"/>snickering at the simplicity with which
							I had been bamboozled by the crafty Spaniard. The partizans of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, and Crawford
							himself were exulting in the same contemplation of a slur upon my
							sagacity, and delighting in the supposed failure of the negotiation,
							because its failure brought unavoidable disgrace upon me— By the
							goodness of that inscrutable Providence, which entraps dishonest
							artifice in its own snares, Onis divulged his trick too soon for its
							success— Clay was the first to snuff the fragrance of this hopeful
							blasting vapour, and to waft it as his tribute of incense to the
							President. The demand of a formal declaration by Spain, that the grants
							in question were by the Treaty null and void, completely and
							unequivocally obtained at last, has thoroughly disappointed all the
							calculators of my downfall by the Spanish Negotiation, and left me with
							credit rather augmented than impaired by the result. It now remains for
							the Treaty to receive its Execution, and the aid of the same overruling
							hand is implored that it may prove as advantageous to this Union, as its
							warmest friends ever anticipated— The Report on Weights and Measures is
							a work of different character.— The call of both Houses of Congress for
							a Report upon a subject which has occupied for the last sixty years many
							of the ablest men in Europe, and to which all the power, and all the
							philosophical and mathematical learning and ingenuity of France and of
							Great-Britain have been incessantly directed, was a fearful and
							oppressive task— It has now been executed, and it will be for the public
							judgment to pass upon it— The manuscript has been seen only by the
							Clerks in the Department who made copies of it, and by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							the Secretary of War— I communicated it to him with the request that he
							would peruse it and suggest any alterations which he should think
							advisable— He recommended the striking out of a few passages, amounting
							in the whole to about half a page, and two or three variations of
							expression— His opinion of the work was favourable; though he thinks the
							objection will be made that it is too much of a Book, for a mere
							official Report— I altered and erased every passage which he
							disapproved, though <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bailey</persRef> told me he thought one of them ought to
							have been spared— It is, after all the time and pains that I have
							bestowed upon it a hurried and imperfect work; but I have no reason to
							expect that I shall ever be able to accomplish any literary labour more
							important to the best ends of human exertion, public utility, or upon
							which the remembrance of my children, may dwell with more satisfaction.

						<p><date>23. VI:</date> In consequence of my neglect to have my Deed from
							the Ways of my House in F. Street, recorded within six Months from the
							day of its date, I find myself under the necessity of having it executed
							again: on discovering the consequences of my carelessness, I immediately
							sent the deed to <persRef ref="way-andrew">Andrew Way</persRef>, and

								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ninian
								Edwards</persRef> Senator from Illinois, called at my Office, <pb

							he wishes <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							specially and most earnestly recommended by <persRef
								ref="walker-freeman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker</persRef>
							the Senator from Georgia, may receive the appointment of territorial
							Secretary— The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> has
							already written to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, offering him the Office of Governor of the
							Territory— I received a Note from the President, with a large bundle of
							applications and recommendations for Office, to be classed. He also
							requested me to call upon him before dinner— I received two Notes from
								<persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> referring to two
							Articles of the ratified Treaty, with a demand of measures for carrying
							them into execution— I took them to the President, and had his assent to
							the answers which I propose to give there. The President read to me some
							detached paragraphs of the Address which he proposes to deliver at his
							second inauguration. Some question has been suggested to the President
							whether he should deliver on that occasion, <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
							address; some of his Virginian friends having taken a fancy that it is
							anti-republican, and not authorised by the Constitution— I entertained
							no such opinion, but told him that if he concluded to omit the address;
							notice of his intention should be given in the newspapers, as there
							would be a great concourse of people; to witness his taking the Oath;
							and they would be much disappointed, if there should be nothing but that
							naked ceremony. He will refer the question to a cabinet consultation.
							The President also mentioned to me that <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Levitt Harris</persRef> had
							been with him and exhibited to him a number of Letters which he, Harris
							had received from me, some of them highly confidential— That Harris had
							told him the trial of his action against <persRef ref="lewis-william">W.
								D. Lewis</persRef> for Slander was expected soon to come on at
							Philadelphia. I received last week a Letter from Lewis informing me that
							a Commission from the Court had issued to take my deposition. The
							President said Harris had told him that he should prove at the trial
							that all the witnesses against him in Russia, were perjured villains,
							and had intimated that if I should testify to any thing which I had
							heard against him from them, he might be compelled in his own defence,
							to produce to the Court and Jury these confidential Letters from me,
							written some of them after I had left Russia, to prove that I considered
							him still as a person worthy of confidence— But there were passages in
							the Letters not relevant to the Cause upon trial, which it might <hi
								rend="italic">not </hi>be for the public interest, or which I might
							be personally unwilling to disclose to public view; and Harris said he
							had brought the Letters that the President and I myself might mark the
							passages, which we would wish to have withheld from the Court and Jury—
							Harris had read to the President several passages which he himself
							considered as of that character; and particularly one of a Letter from
							Ghent, written towards the close of the year 1814 and which took a
							gloomy view of the state of public affairs at that time— Harris had not
							left the Letters with the President, but the paragraph spoke of
							Great-Britain of the other European Powers and of our own Affairs, in a
							manner which might have some unfavourable effect if now published— Not
							in the slightest degree upon my patriotism or integrity; but it might
							excite a temporary prejudice against me, particularly on the score of
							discretion in committing such Sentiments to a European Post-Office at
							that time— The President said he had not promised Harris that he would
							speak to me on the subject at-all. He had for some time hesitated
							whether he should mention it to me; but he had finally concluded to make
							this communication to me, and leave me to determine for myself, what it
							would be proper for me to do. If the information that I had,
							unfavourable to Harris, was merely of hearsay from these persons in
							Russia, I might with propriety decline giving testimony in the case— I
							told the President that my knowledge of Harris’s conduct, as implicated
							in the trial of this cause, was by no means limited to hearsay. I knew
							much from personal observation, and most of all from Harris’s own
							admissions. That I wrote confidentially to Harris upon public affairs, I
							well remembered, and that there might <pb type="ms" n="531"/>be in those
							Letters many indiscretions, and many things not suitable to the public
							eye, was highly probable; how far a Court of Justice would admit the
							production of such papers, having no relation to the cause before them I
							knew not, but if they were to be produced for the purpose of
							discrediting my testimony, whatever their effect might be, I must abide
							by the consequences— I then added that I could not but consider this
							application of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, as very
							extraordinary, nor was it possible for me to avoid ascribing it to
							motives which I could not approve— It had the appearance of an attempt
							to deter me from testifying what I do know, by a threat of divulging
							something which I might be afraid should be known of myself. Such a
							threat I could treat no otherwise than with defiance. I should testify
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, nothing but the truth, nor
							should I say one word the more or the less, for any thing that it was in
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s power to produce, as having
							passed between him and me— The President said that he had told Harris
							that this step would be liable to such a construction on my part; and it
							had been his own reason for doubting whether he ought to have mentioned
							it to me at-all— But he should see Harris again, and would tell him that
							he should decline all further interposition in the case.— On returning
							home from the President’s I looked into my old Letter Books; and found
							in the Public Letter Book, Volume 2. all the Letters to Harris, which I
							wrote him from Ghent, and among the rest the Letter from which he had
							read the extract to the President. I saw immediately, Harris’s drift,
							first in reading this extract to the President; secondly, in the threat
							of producing it to the Court and Jury; and thirdly in the offer to
							withhold it, if the President or I would express the wish that it should
							be withheld— It is in page 192. 193. of the Letter Book dated the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of November 1814— In describing the
							dangers of our situation, it said among other things that we had a
							“feeble and penurious Government”— Harris thought the President would
							take this as a reflection upon the administration of that time and that
							it would excite his distrust of me— The extract spoke in terms of
							extreme bitterness against the British Government and certain British
							Officers by name— It spoke of the policy, pursued by the other powers of
							Europe, not excepting Russia, with Anger and Indignation— In my present
							public situation, I might be very unwilling that the British and Russian
							Governments should know, what I thought of them then. The extract spoke
							of the retreat of the British from Plattsburg, and of their repulse from
							Baltimore, as more disgraceful to them than glorious to us; the
							publication of which would wound the National pride of the Country— All
							this had no more relation to the cause of Harris upon trial, than it had
							to the trial of <persRef ref="wild-jonathan">Jonathan Wild</persRef> the
							great; but Harris fancied I should be afraid of having it come before
							the public, and took this indirect way through the President to remind
							me of what he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, if hard pushed; and above
							all to deter me from producing his Letters of 3, 4. and 6. June 1812. My
							course of proceeding was at once plain before me— To tell the President
							that Harris might produce any Letter from me that he possessed, and to
							explain to him my motives which I perfectly recollected for writing to
							Harris that Letter, at that time— I spent this Evening at home.</p>

						<p><date>24. VII:</date><persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gouverneur</persRef>, the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> Nephew, Son in Law, and
							private Secretary, called at my House this morning; I called at the
							President’s with a Note received of yesterday’s date, from the French
							Minister <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de
							Neuville</persRef>— I sent him two or three days since the copy of a
							Full-power, made out by the President’s direction, authorizing me to
							treat with him upon commercial arrangements— The Note of Yesterday was
							introductory to the Negotiation— Its principle object was to ask an
							answer to a long Letter, which de Neuville had written to me the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1818. upon a claim raised by the
							French Government, upon the 8<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of
							the Louisiana cession Treaty— I had already answered one long note of
							his upon the subject, and had left his reply unanswered, only to avoid
							altercation, upon a claim which had no substance, and upon which my
							answer to his first Letter, was of itself a sufficient answer to his
							reply— But when after the Act of <pb type="ms" n="532"/>Congress of 15
							May last, and the retaliatory ordinances of the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">king of France</persRef>, of 26. July, the French
							Government had been dragged into this negotiation, finding themselves
							unanswerably pressed by Notes of great ability from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef>, they started from the
							course by setting up again, this Louisiana claim and declaring it
							indispensably connected with the arrangement of the question upon
							discriminating duties— And as Gallatin was not instructed upon the
							Louisiana claim, they made this a pretext for transferring the
							negotiation here, and sending de Neuville back here, to finish it; with
							an ulterior destination to Brazil, held out to our Cotton-planters in
							Terrorem. His Letter now calls for an answer to his old one of June
							1818—and hints, at two other Affairs, meaning the cases of the Apollon
							and Eugene, as also requiring adjustment before we can come to the
							settlement of commercial interests— The President thought the first
							thing to be done was to answer the old Louisiana claim-Letter, and to
							offer to dismiss the suit against the Apollon, and restore the vessel to
							the <persRef ref="edon-unknown">captain</persRef>— I told the President
							that I had found in my Letter-books, the Letters from which <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Harris</persRef>
							had read passages to him; and particularly that of which he had
							yesterday mentioned to me the substance. I explained to him the motives
							for writing it, which were altogether of a public nature—to prepare him,
							and through him as far as I was able the people in power in Russia, for
							the unfavourable result of that campaign, which there was every reason
							to expect—to impress them with the idea that notwithstanding all our
							distresses and disasters at that time we should ultimately triumph over
							them all— And to stimulate the Russian Government itself to take an
							active interest in our favour, by shewing that our cause was in a great
							measure their own. The expression of “a feeble and penurious Government”
							I said, he had I presumed understood as referring, not to the Executive
							administration; but particularly to the inefficient measures of Congress
							at that time— The President said, that in substance it was no more than
							he had himself said in his Official Reports— I observed that in my
							present situation, the British and Russian Governments might be
							displeased if they should see my animadversions upon their policy as
							then pursued; but they would doubtless recollect, and lay to their own
							hearts, the feelings under which it was written, and not expect the
							courtesy of Peace, under the instigations of War— In every other
							respect, I said I could have no objection to any publicity that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris could give to that or any other
							Letter from me— The Baron de Neuville came to the Office and had a
							conference with me— I told him, I should very shortly send him the
							answer to his Louisiana claim Letter of 1818. which had hitherto
							remained unanswered only because it had been thought worse than useless
							to prolong an unprofitable controversy— As to the case of the Apollon I
							told him that the vessel being under seizure for a violation of the
							Revenue Laws, the decision of the Court would determine whether the
							seizure had been legal or not—if legal the Laws must of course have
							their execution. If not legal, the Captain, and all persons interested
							in the property had their remedy in the same Court against the persons
							who had made the seizure— He said that the injury had not been to the
							Captain and owners of the Apollon alone. The commerce of France had been
							in consequence of that seizure, for many Months deprived of the resort
							to the Florida side of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s river, and
							of trading from thence with the United States— The fact was that the
							merchants in France had consulted the king’s Council, and enquired
							whether they could send their ships in this manner to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s river; and he himself had advised
							the answer given by the Council that they might. I told him this was a
							thing upon which we could of course not negotiate, and he again said he
							was willing to leave it to be explained in France by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin— This last disclosure, explains
							the extraordinary and hitherto unaccountable irritation, which he and
								<persRef ref="roth-unknown">Roth</persRef> before him manifested at
							this seizure of the Apollon— The French Government itself, and by his
							advice had become a party to this projected system for evading our
							tonnage duties. The seizure of the Apollon, disconcerted them all; and
							made the Government itself in some sort responsible to their merchants
							for the advice given them— The Baron does not seem to be aware how this
							operates as a justification to us for counteracting this royal scheme of
							contraband. It is apparent that de Neuville intends to make this affair
							a very prominent point in the failure of his negotiation. <pb type="ms"

							with his family. His leave of absence was for six Months, but three of

							the President upon his Memorial to him. I told him that a copy should
							readily be furnished him, but that there were several statements in his
							Memorial and in his Letter to the President incorrect in point of fact.
							Among the rest was one that I had told him his claim was included in the
							renunciations of the Treaty. He insisted that I had. I recapitulated the
							substance of the conversation I had with him on the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of last Month, all which he admitted,
							excepting that he maintained I had told him positively that his claim
							was included in the Treaty, when I had only said to him that I supposed
							it to be so; stating expressly at the same time that the Treaty must
							speak for itself; and that the Commissioners must decide upon it— I also
							now told him that in expressing the opinion that his claim was included
							in the Treaty, I neither did nor could mean that it was provided for in
							a different manner from all others— I spoke of his claim as it existed
							when the Treaty was signed, subject to examination and liquidation by
							the Commissioners like all others— Nor had I ever considered the Treaty
							as stipulating for the payment of the whole of his claim— He said that
							he could not consent to have his claim subjected to the examination of
							the Commissioners— I also remarked upon his statement that he had been
							informed that <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef> had been
							ordered on exchanging the ratifications of the Treaty, to declare that
							the Spanish Government had expressly understood that this claim was
							provided for, specially by the Treaty— General Vivés had never said a
							word to me on the subject. He said No—that Vives was a timid man; and
							when he Meade had called upon him to make this declaration had declined
							doing it, because he had not been expressly instructed to do so. Upon
							the whole, these proceedings give me a very indifferent opinion of
							Meade’s character, and his misconception, or misrepresentation of what I
							said to him; on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of January shews
							how dangerous it is to have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> conversation
							at-all with such a man, without a witness to it.</p>

						<p><date>25. VII:</date> Attended Church at the Bath-room, and heard
								<persRef ref="palfrey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Palfrey</persRef>, preach from Matthew XXII.29. “Jesus answered and
							said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of
							God”— The error of misunderstanding, and misinterpreting the Scriptures,
							is a fruitful topic for a sectarian preacher, but it is a weapon equally
							accessible to the use of all. The errors signalized by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey, were only those in which he
							himself has no faith. After Church I called and paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">Hopkinson</persRef> dined with us,
							and according to his engagement came and sat with me an hour before
							dinner— The object of his seeking this conversation with me was the next
							Presidential election. He gave me to understand, that he was disposed to
							consider me as a Candidate for that occasion— That others were of
							similar disposition; but that it was necessary there should be a concert
							and understanding between them, as there already was and long had been
							between the partizans of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— He said that the
							extent and activity of their intrigues was incredible, and unless
							systematically counteracted, would infallibly be successful— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson that I was perfectly aware of
							the exertions making by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford himself
							and his friends to secure the Presidency <pb type="ms" n="534"/>at the
							next election. There were others making exertions not less ardent and
							persevering for<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt"> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Clinton</persRef> of New-York— There was a third party
							less apparent now, and the struggle of which was eventual; to depend
							upon the issue of the conflict now raging in that State between Clinton
							and <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Tompkins</persRef>. The State was now
							about equally divided; and as there is no marked difference of principle
							to contend for, they are squabbling for men— If either party should
							obtain over the other such an ascendancy as would carry a large majority
							of the State, its leader would be the Candidate of New-York, for the
							Presidency. The only question between them will be; which shall be the
							man— New-York, at any rate will have a Candidate of her own, and if both
							these rivals should be out of the way, she would sooner take up <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>, than
							resort to any other State— The politics of Pennsylvania, will be greatly
							influenced by those of New-York— She too is a divided State, but the
							scuffle for her Governor is between men neither of whom has any
							prospects in the general Government— She will probably be an accessary
							to New-York. Whether any party or any one individual would support or
							propose me as a Candidate, I could not tell; but even in my own native
							State of Massachusetts, the predominating party, the federalists had a
							grudge against me, which they would not lose the opportunity of
							indulging— To one thing however I had made up my mind— I would take no
							one step to advance or promote pretensions to the Presidency— If that
							office was to be the prize of cabal and intrigue, of purchasing
							Newspapers, bribing by appointments or bargaining for foreign Missions,
							I had no ticket in that Lottery. Whether I had the qualifications
							necessary for a President of the United States, was to say the least
							very doubtful to myself— But that I had no talent for obtaining the
							Office by such means was perfectly clear— I had neither talent nor
							inclination for intrigue— I can do nothing, either to canvass for
							myself, or to counteract the canvassing of others— I will have no
							stipendiary editor of Newspapers to extol my talents and services, and
							to criticise or calumniate my rivals— I will devote none of my time to
							devising laws, to increase my own patronage, and multiply canvassers in
							my favour— My time is now not sufficient to discharge the duties of my
							Office; any part of it which I should spend in efforts to make partizans
							or to pull down competitors would be an abandonment of public for
							personal aims— For this, if I had the talent I have not the will; and if
							I had the will I have not the talent. Hopkinson said, that this very
							abstraction from all intrigues would be my principal recommendation—
							That Crawford having nothing but intrigue to support him, having
							manifested utter incompetency to the very Department with which he is
							charged, having never rendered one signal service to the Country, and
							having a standing manifesto of charges affecting his honour as a
							Gentleman, in the pamphlet of <persRef ref="clarke-john">Governor
								Clarke</persRef> against him, would make no head, unless by mere
							want of management in opposing him— That Clinton had embroiled himself
							too much in the turmoil of his own passions, and in his denunciation of
							the General Government had completely failed of substantiating his
							charges. The prospects of Tompkins he thought were no better— He was
							deeply involved in debt, and stood equivocally before the public in
							relation to the settlement of his Accounts. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> King had no chance; and he thought I was mistaken in
							believing that the Massachusetts federalists retained their animosity
							against me— And he alluded to the manner in which they had recently
							conferred distinguished honours upon <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>. He said if I should go to Boston next Summer, he
							hoped I should not entertain this opinion of the federalists nor express
							it; and he intimated that <persRef ref="walter-unknown">Walter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="hale-unknown2">Hale</persRef> had been last Sunday
							dissatisfied with opinions which I had expressed relative to the trial
							of the <persRef ref="caroline-brunswick">Queen of England</persRef>;
							which he noticed only to mark what seemingly trifling incidents affected
							the opinions of men— We pursued this Conversation no further, but this
							as well as the Conversations with <persRef ref="allison-burgess"
								>Allison</persRef> and some others gives me warning of what I am to
							expect. If there has ever been an election of a President of the United
							States without canvassing and intrigue, there has been none since that
							of my father— There will probably never be another— The materials for
							canvassing are and <pb type="ms" n="535"/>for some time have been
							plentifully offered to me and pressed upon me— I cannot be ignorant of
							the consequences of declining these offers; but I could not accept them
							with satisfaction to myself or with that consciousness of right which I
							never have forfeited, and which is dearer to me than any station to
							which it is in the power of man, or of Fortune to raise me.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Nelson</persRef> of Virginia,

							minutes for such an Act, which I did, combining the Precedents of the

							establishment of the Commission for Claims— The Affairs of <persRef
								ref="meade-richard">R. W. Meade</persRef> and <persRef

							furnished him of my Report to the President upon his Memorial; the
							Memorial itself was written by <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter

							resigned that Office in discontent, and apparent delinquency— <persRef

							referring to the papers which by the direction of the President were
							delivered to Harris on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of December
							1819. and I wrote him a Letter this day requiring him to return them,

									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Tayloe’s</persRef>, where

								Clay</persRef> the House of Representatives chose by ballot a
							Committee of 23 Members, who were joined by a Committee of 7 from the
							Senate, and their object was a last attempt to devise a plan for
							admitting Missouri into the Union— This day M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay made to the House the Report of this Committee— They
							propose a <hi rend="italic">conditional</hi> admission, upon terms more
							humiliating to the People of Missouri, than it would be to require that
							they should expunge the exceptionable Article from their Constitution;
							for they declare it a fundamental Condition of their admission, that the
							Article shall <pb type="ms" n="536"/>never be construed to authorize the
							passage of any law by which any Citizen of either of the States in this
							Union shall be excluded from his privileges under the Constitution of
							the United States; and they require that the Legislature of the State by
							a solemn public Act should declare the assent of the State to this
							condition, and transmit a copy of the Act, by the first Monday of
							November next to the President of the United States, but in substance it
							binds them to nothing— The Resolution was however taken up this day in
							the House, read three times and passed by a vote of 87 to 81— A joint
							Committee of both Houses of Congress waited this day upon the President
							and informed him of his re-election— The President told them that he
							proposed to take the Oath of Office next Monday. The fourth of March,
							the day upon which the Presidential term of four years commences,
							happens this year to fall on Sunday; for the first time since the
							establishment of the present Constitution: and the question occurred
							whether the President should take the official Oath, on that day, or
							postpone it to the next. He wrote to the <persRef ref="marshall-john"
								>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court</persRef>, requesting their
							opinion upon it; and they advised postponing the ceremony till Monday.
							The question yet remains undetermined whether any inaugural address is
							to be delivered or not.</p>

						<p><date>27. VII:</date><persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef> the British Consul General called upon
							me at the Office this Morning. My object in seeing him was to ascertain
							his recollections of an agreement interchangeably signed by him and
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, at the exchange of the Ratifications of the Treaty
							of Ghent. By an Article in the Treaty, the manner in which the
							Commissioners under various Articles, should be paid was to be agreed
							upon at the Exchange of the Ratifications— This agreement was
							accordingly made; but it only refers to the payment of the Commissioners
							under the Treaty of 1794 as a precedent, and explains that the charge of
							their payment should be <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> borne by both
							parties— But it does not <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> the amount of the
							Salaries. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s understanding of this
							agreement was that the Salaries of the Commissioners should be of £1000
							Sterling a year, each, because under the Treaty of 1794. that was the
							Salary of the Commissioners appointed to ascertain the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Croix river. But under that Treaty there
							were several Commissions, and some of the Commissioners had £1500 and
							others £1000. Under the Ghent Treaty Commissions, the American
							Commissioners have received £1000 a year, but they have claimed more;
							and particularly <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van
								Ness</persRef> the Commissioner under the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th. </hi>Article, upon the allegation that the British
							Commissioners receive each £1200 per annum. And, it is this very claim
							of <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, which is now resulting in an Act of
							Congress, cutting down the Salaries to less than the £1000. for the
							economists in Congress, stimulated by the adversaries personal and
							political, of the Commissioners Van Ness and <persRef ref="porter-peter"
								>P. B. Porter</persRef>, now say, if the British Government under
							the agreement can give their Commissioners <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
							than the £1000 a year, we have the same right to give ours less. I found
							by Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker, that he had
							no recollection of any Sums having been mentioned at the signature of
							the agreement between him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe. He
							had understood that the Salaries of the Commissioners on both sides were
							to be the same— That they were to be the same in amount, as those of the
							former Commissioners; and that they were to be equally paid by both
							parties. But he said there had been no discussion of the terms of the
							agreement— The reference had been general and without scrutiny to the
							precedent of the former Treaty— The Bill reported in Congress reduces
							the Salary of the American Commissioners, from the commencement of the
							present year to 3000 dollars a year, and that of the Agents to 2500
							dollars— And they have struck the item out of the general Appropriation
							Bill, proposing to make no appropriation, excepting for the Salaries,
							this year; on the allegation that there was in December last a balance
							of eight or ten thousand Dollars of the former appropriations
							unexpended— But neither the general Appropriation, nor this particular
							Bill has yet passed; the latter not even through the House of
							Representatives. <persRef ref="walker-freeman">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Freeman Walker</persRef> the Senator from Georgia, and
							the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> came also to the Office— Walker’s object was most
							earnestly to recommend <pb type="ms" n="537"/>a friend of his by the
							name of <persRef ref="walton-george">Walton</persRef> to be Secretary
							for the new Territory of Florida. De Neuville’s purpose, related to the
							remission of the retaliatory discriminating duties, imposed by the Act
							of Congress of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of May last, and by
							the Ordinance of the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">King of France</persRef>
							of 26 July, so far as they operated upon persons not having notice of
							them. The Act of Congress imposed a Tonnage duty of 18 dollars a Ton
							upon French vessels and was made to commence on the first of July— The
							French Ordinance was even retrospective, and applied to American
							vessels, which had sailed from the United States after the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of June. Several French vessels which
							had sailed from France before the Act was known there to exist, have
							been required to pay the Tonnage duty— One American Vessel has been in a
							similar predicament in France— It was recommended by the President to
							Congress at the commencement of the Session to authorize the remission
							of all the duties levied on vessels not having had notice of the Act— A
							Bill for that purpose was prepared in the House of Representatives; but
							has been left pending upon a proposal to insert a proviso making it
							conditional; upon the reciprocal remission on the part of France. Since
							the arrival of the Baron he has declared himself ready to engage for the
							remission in France, and I urged the <persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
								>Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means</persRef>, and some
							other members of the House, to pass the Bill, without annexing any
							Condition; which was accordingly done in the House this day— I had also
							much desultory conversation with the Baron upon the other objects of his
							mission, but see no prospect of its successful termination. He has
							repeatedly suggested the mutual repeal of the Act of 15. May last, and
							of the Royal Ordinance of 26 July, so as to commence the Negotiation
							upon the Statu quo before either of them. If the object of this were
							only to save the pride of France, from the appearance of making
							concessions upon compulsion, I should be for indulging her; but it would
							throw the issue of the Negotiation into her hands, and from the tenour
							of his conversation it is clear they are not prepared for any terms to
							which we can agree. I have therefore told him that although the <hi
								rend="italic">amount</hi> of the tonnage duty imposed by the Act of
							15. May, might perhaps be higher than was absolutely necessary, some
							such measure was indispensable; even the present state of things was
							unequivocally better for us, than the Statu quo before the Act of 15.
							May— I called at the President’s— The Committee of foreign Relations
							sent back the minutes I had made as heads for a Bill, with a request for
							a draft of a Bill, which I accordingly prepared and sent, and which was
							reported to the House this day by <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Nelson</persRef> from the Committee
							of foreign Relations— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> either having sufficient occupation upon
							other affairs, or special motives for a suspension of hostilities
							against me, at this moment made no opposition to the measure, nor any
							invidious remark upon the intercourse, between the Committee and a Head
							of an Executive Department— The Senate have passed two Bills one for the
							Adjustment of the Claims, and the other, for authorizing the President
							to take possession of the Territories. The House referred them both
							together with their own Bill to a Committee of the whole on the state of
							the Union— <persRef ref="pope-daniel">Daniel Pope Cook</persRef> was at
							my house this Morning; he has friends to recommend for appointments; and
							in that sort of jest which has serious meaning desired <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to advise me, not to
							break my own Neck. Cook is the only Representative in Congress from the
							State of Illinois; which State will still have only one Representative
							under the new Census. It has already been foreseen by Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs. </hi><persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt"
								>Clinton</persRef>, and their respective partizans that the most
							probable result of the next Presidential election will be, no positive
							majority of the electoral College for any Candidate, so that the choice
							will fall to the House of Representatives— And as upon that choice the
							vote is not individual; but by States, the single Representative from
							Illinois will balance a whole Delegation from New-York or Pennsylvania—
							Cook is known to be a friend of mine, and as well as <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edwards</persRef> the Senator, is a family Relation of <persRef
								ref="pope-john">John Pope</persRef> of Kentucky, the depressed but
							always formidable rival of Clay. There has been <pb type="ms" n="538"
							/>therefore, and will continue to be, a violent and persevering struggle
							to supplant Cook; and the concert of operations here is managed by
								<persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse B. Thomas</persRef> the other
							Senator from the State; and with at least all the weight and influence
							of Crawford— The President whose <hi rend="italic">intention</hi> for
							the next Presidential election may be neutrality; but whose leaning is
							to Crawford as a Virginian, Southern Man, and Slave-holder, indulges
							Crawford in all his views of appointments. Edwards and Cook therefore
							can scarcely ever obtain any appointment for their friends, but almost
							the whole distribution of Offices has been to their most active and
							inveterate enemies. This exasperates them the more because they have
							been the uniform supporters and champions of the President and his
							Administration, against that disguised, and insidious but most venomous
							opposition which Crawford has pursued against it. Cook and Edwards are
							of opinion that my acquiescence in this course of things is a deficiency
							both of judgment and Spirit— That I ought to take an earnest and
							decisive part in this bestowal of appointments, and meet Crawford upon
							his own ground— And as I have forborn to do this, Cook intimates that I
							shall break my own neck— Yet my conduct is governed by a sense of duty
							and of delicacy alone— This subject of the next Presidential election,
							comes up in forms almost numberless— My wife had this evening her weekly
							tea-party, which was very numerously attended— Among the company was
								<persRef ref="brush-henry">Henry Brush</persRef> of Ohio, a member
							of the present Congress, but not re-elected to the next. In the course
							of the Evening he told me, commencing rather abruptly the Conversation,
							that he had made up his mind, that I was the most suitable person for
							the next Presidency, though he had never before expressed this opinion
							to any one— I told him that I was obliged to him for his good opinion;
							but that four years was too long a term to look forward for Candidates,
							on that occasion— He said that from this time all parties would be
							looking forward to that period— That with regard to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay his political conduct had been
							somewhat actuated by his situation, and the irritation of
							circumstances.— His views had been pointedly in opposition to mine, but
							he Brush had recently had conversation with Clay on the subject, and
							Clay had assured him that he entertained towards me, no unfriendly or
							disrespectful sentiment whatever— Brush said he had been gratified at
							this assurance, and wished there might be a good understanding between
							Clay and me— That Clay must be a public man in this Country, as the
							Western People would certainly insist upon it— I told Brush, that I
							could have no possible objection to Clay’s being a public man, and just
							what the Western People would wish to make him— There had never been
							between him and me any ill understanding of <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							seeking. I had never stood in his way: he had occasionally thought fit
							to throw himself athwart of mine— This Session of Congress he had
							suspended hostilities; but the three preceding Sessions he had kept them
							up without intermission; in a manner to say the least not magnanimous.
							By Sneers and Sarcasms in the House of Representatives, where I could
							not be present for defence or retaliation; and by virulent abuse in the
							Newspapers unanswerable by me, because anonymous. But I well understood
							the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and rendered full
							justice both to his talents and good qualities. I had no disposition to
							interfere with his advancement, and should be well pleased that the
							Nation should have the benefit of his services, in any station suitable
							for them— <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sanford</persRef> the Senator from New-York, was also here this
							Evening— His term of service too expires with the present Session, the
							Legislature of N. York having chosen <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Martin Van Buren</persRef> their Senator for the next six years in
							Sanford’s place. Sanford has been a most useful and very able member of

							calling upon me before he should leave the City.</p>

						<p><date>28. VII:</date><persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ninian Edwards</persRef> the Senator
							from Illinois called upon me at the Office this Morning. He has several
							friends whom he recommends for Offices in Florida; but he was especially
							earnest in behalf of <persRef ref="walton-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walton</persRef>, the person urged by
								<persRef ref="walker-freeman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freeman
								Walker</persRef>, the Senator from Georgia, to be the Secretary.
							Edwards says that Walker will be the head of a third party in Georgia,
							opposed to both the parties, of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Governor Clark</persRef>— Walker is a man of
							Talents, Eloquence, fair character and popular manners. He is not of the
							turbulent Spirits who make their way by perpetual conflict, but of those
							mild and conciliatory characters who win their way by captivating
							kindness. Edwards told me that <persRef ref="elliott-john"
								>Elliott</persRef>, the other Senator from Georgia, had assured him
							he had attained the very summit of his ambition. That he could not form
							a wish in this world for any thing more than a Seat in the Senate of the
							United States with Freeman Walker for his Colleague. Edwards recommends
							also a <persRef ref="duval-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duval</persRef> of Kentucky to be a judge, and wishes the
							appointment of <persRef ref="pope-john">John Pope</persRef>, as one of
							the Commissioners of Claims— The Spanish Minister, <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, was at the Office, and
							urges answers to several Notes and Letters that he has written me. Some
							of them relating to the execution of the Treaty; and others to different
							objects; among which are the case of the French ship Apollon, the
							capture by one of our armed ships of a Slave-trading vessel called the
							Esperanza; and the Arrest for debt at New-Orleans of the <persRef
								ref="villavaso-nicholas">Spanish Consul, Villavaso</persRef>. He
							also requested me to send him as I had promised the answer to the
							observations which according to his Instructions he had <hi
								rend="italic">verbally</hi> made to me for the Consideration of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>; at the time when he
							had declared his readiness to exchange the Ratifications of the Treaty—
							I accordingly drafted an answer, which was approved by the president,
							and sent; together with a short answer to one of the General’s Notes. At
							the President’s I met <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy. The President has not yet determined whether to deliver an
							Address at his second inauguration, or simply to take the Oath, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson inclines to recommend the latter
							course— I dined this day at the President’s with all the Corps
							Diplomatique together with several members of Congress. It was a dinner
							to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef> on
							the occasion of his return to this Country, and to the Spanish Minister
							on the final conclusion of the Treaty— The Senate this day by a vote of
							28 to 14. adopted the Resolution for the conditional admission of the
							State of Missouri into the Union, reported by the large joint Committee,
							and which had yesterday passed the house of Representatives, and thus
							this second Missouri question has been compromised like the first. The
							greatest results of this conflict of three Sessions have been to make
								<persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef>, Speaker of the
							House of Representatives, and to bring into full display the talents and
							resources of influence of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>. By a singular piece of
							good Fortune for him, just at the moment of his arrival here, <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> in whose management it had been, was confined by
							severe illness to his chamber, and is so still. The majority against the
							unconditional admission was small, but very decided. The problem for the
							Slave representation to solve was the precise extent of concession
							necessary for them to detach from the opposite party a sufficient number
							of anti-servile votes just to turn the majority. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay found at last this expedient, which the Slave-voters
							would not have accepted from any one not of their own party, and to
							which his greatest difficulty was to obtain the acquiescence of his own
							friends— The timid and weak-minded, dropped off one by one from the free
							side of the question, until a majority was found for the compromise of
							which the serviles have <pb type="ms" n="540"/>the substance, and the
							liberals the shadow. In the progress of this Affair the distinctive
							character of the inhabitants of the several great divisions of this
							Union has been shewn more in relief than perhaps in any National
							transaction since the Establishment of the Constitution— It is perhaps
							accidental that the combination of talent and influence has been
							greatest on the Slave side.— The importance of the question has been
							much greater to them than to the other side. Their union of exertion has
							been consequently closer, and more unshakable. They have threatened and
							intreated, bullied and wheedled, until their more simple adversaries
							have been half coaxed half frightened into a surrender of their
							principles for a bauble of insignificant promises. The champions of the
							North did not however judiciously select their position for this
							contest— There must be at some time a conflict upon this very question
							between Slave and free-representation; but this is not the time; nor was
							this the proper occasion for contesting it— There was also a message
							this day sent to both Houses of Congress, suggesting the expediency of
							prolonging the time for receiving the returns of the Census— Its
							necessity chiefly proceeds from delays in the Eastern District of
							Virginia.</p>
