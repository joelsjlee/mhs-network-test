						<p><date>IV:45.</date> I began the year with invocation to the father of
							mercies, for virtue and wisdom; and if it be consistent with his
							Providence, for prosperity— I spent the morning in my chamber at my
							usual occupation of writing— I am yet examining the Laws of the several
							States of the Union, upon weights and measures, and this has given me
							the occasion for a cursory inspection of the Edition now in the process
							of publication of the Statutes at large of Virginia, from the first
							Settlement of the Colony— A work which I wish should be executed also in
							Massachusetts.— I had some conversation with my son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, concerning his future prospects
							and intentions— He inclines to the study of the Law; which concurs with
							my own wishes. As he told me his Class were to study the Federalist, at
							their next term, I have advised him to read it through here, during the
							vacation— He is undertaking also to be an early riser, and has good
							dispositions— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="johnson-fanny">Fanny Johnson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>, and I with <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, and my Sons George
							and <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> attended at the drawing
							room, at the President’s— It was more thronged with company, than I ever
							saw it on any similar occasion. “Donec eris felix, multos numerabis
							amicos.” <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> by a vote, with a single exception unanimous, of
							all the electoral Colleges of this Union, has just been re-elected
							President of the United States, for a second term of four years— No such
							state of things as the present has existed since the establishment of
							the present Constitution; for although the second election of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, like the first, was
							unanimous; yet the opposition to his administration was more organized
							and more violent, than it now is to that of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Monroe. After the drawing-room was over I attended at my
							Office— <persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien</persRef> called
							there. He is still soliciting of the Committee of Claims for an
							explanatory act in his favour, and the <persRef ref="williams-lewis"
								>Chairman of the Committee</persRef> has written to me, for my
							opinion in the case. I received a private Letter from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">John Forsyth</persRef> our Minister at Madrid,
							informing me that the Cortes on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October had advised, in secret Session the ratification of the Florida
							Treaty— The Letter is of the same day, and is the first direct
							information of the Event. It confirms that which had been received on
							the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month from <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> who had been notified of it by
							a private Letter from the <persRef ref="fernandezdevelasco-bernardo"
								>Duke of Frías</persRef> the Spanish Ambassador in London, on the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October— The rumour has been
							circulating here these five or six weeks, but it would scarcely seem
							credible that within four days, three months should elapse from the day
							of a transaction so important to us at Madrid, before any direct advice
							of it should come to us. It shews that Instructions should be given to
							the Representatives of the Public in Spain to transmit to us notice of
							all events of primary importance by the way of London and Liverpool— We
							had company to dine with us. <persRef ref="dana-samuel">S. W.

								>Labouchère</persRef>. Taylor accepted yesterday, but sent me an
							excuse this day, upon a plea of business— The rest were engaged. I gave
							most of the invitations at the Drawing-room this morning— We had a
							pleasant and cheerful party— In the Evening, after the rest of the
							company had retired the young people had a dance, and I made a party at
							Chess with W. S. Smith— The foreign Ministers paid us this Morning
							visits of form.</p>

							the House of Representatives from Virginia came this morning and
							introduced at my house a young man by the name of <persRef
								ref="cabell-unknown2">Cabell</persRef>, from that State— At the
							Office I made a Draft of a Report to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, with the papers relating to the Slave-trade,
							called for by Resolution of the House of Representatives; and also of a
							Message from the President to the House, to communicate these papers—
								<persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Canning</persRef>, to whom I had sent my answer to his Note of 20.
							December on this subject, called at my Office, and we had a desultory
							Conversation of at least three hours, on the Slave-trade, the <persRef
								ref="caroline-brunswick">Queen’s</persRef> trial, European Politics,
							Literature and indeed all sorts of topics. Concerning the Slave-trade,
							he expressed the opinion that the proposals in my note would be quite
							inadequate to the object proposed, the effectual suppression of the
							trade. <pb type="ms" n="479"/>But he added his only remaining duty was
							to transmit them to his Government; which he should immediately do— He
							also enquired what amount of force it was contemplated by us, to keep,
							on the African Coast; what particular Instructions it was proposed to
							give in concert to the commanders, and in what manner it was supposed
							they might co-operate together— I told him the general instruction to
							co-operate, if agreed upon in principle by the two Governments, would
							lead to information from the Officers themselves upon which more
							particular instructions might afterwards be prepared. That for the
							present the Instruction to cruize in company together when they may find
							it useful, and to communicate information mutually as opportunities may
							offer, was all that was deemed advisable, but there could be no doubt
							that a more special concurrent exertion might hereafter be combined. It
							was very apparent that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning was in no
							wise satisfied with our proposed substitute; nor is it to be expected
							that his Government will be more so.— By the accounts just received from
							England it has been learnt that the Bill of Pains and Penalties against
							the Queen, has been abandoned in the House of Peers, after a vote by a
							majority of nine, that it should pass to a third reading. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning that I honoured <persRef
								ref="canning-george">his kinsman</persRef> for the Independence of
							Spirit with which as a Minister he had refused to take part in the
							prosecution against the Queen; and the more so, as I was well aware of
							the conflict through which he must have passed in the cabinet, before he
							had come to that conclusion. I added that the issue had shewn that the
							course which he would have taken in that affair would have been the
							best, even with a view to the interest of <persRef ref="george-iv">the
								king</persRef>— I made also many free remarks upon the proceedings
							in the house of Lords; upon the Speeches of the <persRef
								ref="scott-john2">Chancellor</persRef>, upon the temporizing and
							consciencious scruples of the Bishops, and upon the advantages taken of
							them by the opposition peers. Canning was as usual exceedingly cautious,
							to avoid expressing any opinion of his own; only by a sort of
							involuntary exclamation, saying that the trial of the Queen was to be
							sure “a very bad affair.” Of the rest, he said little; but admired the
							consummate ability of the Lord Chancellor’s Speech on the bills passing
							to the third reading— The rest of this Conversation were too tedious to
							detail; consisting altogether of my opinions, given with little
							restraint, and in a dogmatical tone, while he listened, as if with
							deference; now and then slyly insinuating rather than asserting his
							dissent, but contradicting nothing— It was near six O’Clock when he left
							me— <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> had been before, to
							pay his visit— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had in the Evening

								>President’s</persRef> with the Report to him, the draft of a
							Message to the House of Representatives, and the copies of the documents
							to be sent with them— The House of Representatives, yesterday on the
							motion of <persRef ref="storrs-henry">Henry R. Storrs</persRef>, a
							member from the State of New-York, passed a Resolution “that the
							Committee on the Expenditures of the Department of State be instructed,
							specially, to inquire whether any moneys have been disbursed through
							that Department, or authorized to be disbursed, on account of any salary
							or compensation to an Agent, or acting agent, or any person employed in
							that capacity on the part of the United States during the year 1820.
							under the sixth or seventh Articles of the late Treaty of Peace with
							Great-Britain; and if any moneys have been so paid, to inquire and
							report to the House, by authority of what Law, and by virtue and out of
							what appropriation the same has been paid.” This is a thrust in the dark
							at me as Secretary of State. There is of late years in the House of
							Representatives, a standing committee upon the Expenditures in each of
							the Executive Departments; consisting of <pb type="ms" n="480"/>three
							members, appointed at the first Session of each Congress, for the whole
							term of the Congress. These Committees are in principle set as a Watch
							over the Heads of Departments; to guard against their wasting the public
							money; but hitherto I had heard nothing of the Committee upon the
							Department of State, except of its appointment— The Chairman of the
							Committee now was a <persRef ref="peek-harmanus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Peek</persRef>, a Member from New-York who has not been
							here this Session— But this day, Storrs was appointed to supply his
							place— At the last Session of Congress the Appropriation for the Salary
							of an Agent to the Commission under the sixth and seventh Articles of
							the Treaty of Ghent, was struck out of the Estimates; <persRef
								ref="hawkins-samuel">Samuel Hawkins</persRef> who had been the agent
							having resigned or been dismissed, and no other appointed in his place—
								<persRef ref="delafield-joseph">Joseph<space/>Delafield</persRef>
							then applied to be allowed to perform the indispensable duties of Agent,
							for the same Salary which he had received as Secretary to the former
							agent, and the necessary additional expences. I was directed by the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to accept
							Delafield’s proposal, upon condition that the account of his
							compensation and expences should be sanctioned by the <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">Commissioner</persRef>, and come within the
							Appropriation for the year. Delafield’s Letter and my answer, were
							communicated to the House with the other papers, upon <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallary’s</persRef> call; and Storrs seems to think he has me upon
							the hip, for an expenditure without Law or appropriation— It happens
							that there is both Law and appropriation— For Delafield can receive
							nothing without the sanction of the Commissioner, which is authorized by
							the Treaty, and his payment is expressly limited to come within the
							appropriation of the year— Storrs is a federalist, of some talents and a
							handsome Speaker— He has been a member of three successive Congresses,
							which for a member from the State of New-York is very unusual; but
							having mistaken the sense of his Constituents on the Missouri questions,
							he will probably not be returned to the next Congress.— This prospect
							which he has of late distinctly foreseen has disconcerted all his
							expectations of public life, and produced effects upon his temper and
							habits unfavourable to his consideration and influence— He made a
							violent attack upon me in the Seminole-War debate in January 1819. but
							was afterwards on terms of good humour and politeness with me— He is now
							dissatisfied with himself and with all the world— This motion is
							probably made with a view to make a special scrutiny into the expences
							of the Department of State, and to signalize if he can any
							misapplication in it of public money. I trust he will be
							disappointed.</p>

						<p><date>4. VII:</date> I received this morning a Letter from <persRef

							of the Senate; informing me that he has received no list of the
							electoral votes for President and Vice-President and Vice-President,

							by the Post Office to the President of the Senate at the Seat of

							shall send a special Messenger to the District Judge with whom the list

							enquire, if there was any person whom he would wish to have sent as the

							immediately sent for Radcliff who agreed to go, and for whom I
							immediately drew up a Letter of Instructions, and a Letter to that U.S.
							District judge in the State of Mississippi— He is to depart at 3.
							O’Clock to-morrow Morning— I this day received despatches from <persRef

							announcing definitively the ratification, by the <persRef

							which yet leaves some <pb type="ms" n="481"/>uncertainty upon the

						<p><date>5. VI:</date> The Spanish Minister, <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>General Vivès</persRef> called upon me this morning, and requested
							answers, to several Notes which he has addressed to me; two of which are
							upon the case of the Esperanza, a Spanish vessel taken upon a
							Slave-trading voyage, by the United States Sloop of War Cyane, <persRef
								ref="trenchard-edward">Captain Trenchard</persRef>, sent into
							New-York—one upon the case of a Spanish Consul at New-Orleans, named
								<persRef ref="villavaso-nicholas">Villavaso</persRef>, who has been
							arrested upon a civil process; and two upon the case of the French Ship
							Apollon, seized on the Spanish side of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Mary’s river, for violation of our revenue Laws— A second case of a
							similar character has occurred; that of the Eugene, which after entering
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s river, was forced to go away—
							In these cases, Vivés said he was the more anxious to receive an answer,
							because he was much urged by <persRef ref="roth-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roth</persRef>, the Chargé d’Affaires
							from France— I told him that with regard to the cases of the Esperanza
							and the Consul, delays had occurred from the necessity of ascertaining
							facts, and of awaiting the judicial decisions— In the cases of the
							French vessels, I had waited in the hope of the ratification of the
							Florida Treaty. By that event the jurisdiction of both sides of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s river would belong to the United
							States— The questions of right involved in the transactions relating to
							the Apollon and the Eugene, would cease to be important, and the
							unpleasant discussions likely to result from them, I hoped might be
							abridged— Should that discussion take place, I should be under the
							necessity of making serious complaint against two Spanish Officers; the
								<persRef ref="coppinger-jose">Governor of East-Florida</persRef>,
							for constituting a pretended Port where there was no settlement, and
							could be no honest trade; and the only possible object of which was to
							defraud the revenue of the United States: and <persRef
								ref="clarke-unknown3">the Spanish acting Consul at S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s</persRef>, whose avowed object
							in all these transactions of which he had been the principal agent was
							to evade the Laws, and defraud the revenue of the Union. We were in
							possession of two private Letters written by him, disclosing the whole
							project, and proving that it was in substance a conspiracy against the
							Country where this man was residing under the protection of the Consular
							character— As in the event of the ratification of the Treaty the whole
							project would be at an end, I had hoped to be spared the necessity of
							discussing it, at-all; and wished him to assign this to his Government
							as the reason for delaying the answer to his Notes— He said that the
							Governor of East-Florida, had no authority to constitute the Port of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph, unless by a special power
							from the <persRef ref="cajigal-juan">Governor General of Cuba</persRef>—
							Whether Governor Coppinger had in this case such a power, he Vivés did
							not know— He had himself been surprized that Coppinger should have taken
							such a step precisely at the moment when the ratification of the Treaty
							was hourly expected, and had written to him and earnestly cautioned him
							against anything which should because of complaint to the United States.
							As to the Treaty, he had been assured by his Government that the
							ratification might be confidently expected, and he hoped he should
							speedily receive it by a special messenger. <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef> likewise called upon me, and shewed me a
							communication which he had received from <persRef ref="bulgari-unknown"

							being copy of a Note from the <persRef ref="perezdecastro-evaristo"

								>th.</hi> Articles of the Treaty came, and renewed the request which
							he had already made by Letter, to be regularly attached to the
							Commission— <pb type="ms" n="482"/>I mentioned to him the present state
							of this subject in Congress, upon the Resolutions of <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallary</persRef> and of <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi

							added another offered by <persRef ref="burwell-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burwell</persRef> of Virginia to pass
							an act for fixing the Salaries of the Commissioners and Agents under
							these Commissions— I told him it would be necessary to see what would be
							done upon these proceedings in Congress, before any thing further
							concerning his agency could be determined— I received a Letter of
							enquiries this day from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mallary the
							Chairman of the committee on the documents sent with the Message— There
							was a Ball this Evening at <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi

						<p><date>6. VI:30.</date> A Snow-Storm began about 8 O’Clock this Morning,

							preparing a despatch to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A.

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Witt</persRef> of New-York is
							believed to be past recovery. There is no small alarm among the members,
							at this extraordinary thinning of their ranks by death; and as there is
							no deadly epidemic prevailing among the residents in the City, there
							have arisen suspicions that there is some pernicious infection in the
							mode of heating, or some defect in the ventilation of the Halls at the
							Capitol; especially of the House of Representatives— The Snow-storm
							continued through the last Night, and subsided about eight O’Clock this
							Morning; leaving about a foot deep of Snow; not much drifted; the gale
							not having been very violent— With <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;adams-george;adams-john2" type="multi">the
								boys</persRef>, I waded through the Snow; and attended Church at the
							Capitol— The preacher was a <persRef ref="mcilvaine-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Ilvaine</persRef>, a very young man
							of great promise, settled recently at an Episcopalian Church in
							Georgetown— His text was from Matthew XVI:26. “For what is a man
							profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or
							what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” The Sermon was well
							written and eloquent; but much more in the enthusiastic manner of the
							Methodists than in the usual cool, didactic and argumentative style of
							episcopalian Clergyman— The vehement, passionate and terrifying tone of
							Oratory have of late however, been much practised by the Episcopalians
							in our Southern Countries; and with them they have resumed the rigorous
							Calvinistic doctrines of election and atonement, regeneration and
							reprobation, which the Church of England had long discarded— They have
							been driven to this resource by the desertion of their followers— Fear
							and Hope are the two pillars upon which all religious Faith is built—
							But Fear is an instrument of Necessity— Hope is the creature of
							contingency— Fear flies to a refuge— Hope is always attended with doubt,
							and conscious of its own delusions. Fear is therefore always a more
							efficacious agent than hope, and has far more powerful operation upon
							religious faith. There is another reason for the new kindling fervours
							of the Southern Episcopalians; who are now almost all educated at
							Princeton College— The teachers at that Institution, are <pb type="ms"
								n="483"/>of the most straitest sect of the Calvinists, and men of
							considerable ability— M’Ilvaine is from that school, and a native of the
							State of New-Jersey— He expatiated with great effort of pathos upon the
							importance of the Soul, and the infinite danger of its loss; but he did
							not undertake to explain what the Soul is— That was above his reach— I
							returned home immediately after the service. <persRef

								<persRef ref="parrott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="dana-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana</persRef>, a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef>, the British
							Minister. Parrott came upon the subject of the appointment of a District
							Attorney in New-Hampshire. He wishes the re-appointment of <persRef
								ref="humphreys-daniel">Humphreys</persRef>, who though near eighty
							years of age, is not he says, so incompetent as he has been represented—
							The duties of the Office indeed at this time, and probably during peace
							will continue to be few and unimportant— Parrott gave me much
							information concerning Humphreys, who is an elder brother of the late
								<persRef ref="humphreys-david">General David Humphreys</persRef>— He
							has certain peculiar religious opinions, and the indigence of his old
							age has been occasioned by the profusion of his charitable beneficence
							in younger life. But Parrott said if Humphreys must be dropped, at all
							Events he hoped <persRef ref="clagett-william">young Clagett</persRef>
							would not be nominated in his place; for Clagett had neither talents nor
							integrity— He was at the very bottom of the Bar of New-Hampshire; and
							his conduct towards <persRef ref="plumer-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer</persRef> whose <persRef
								ref="clagett-sarah">daughter</persRef> he had married had been
							shameful. When Plumer was Governor of New-Hampshire, Clagett presuming
							upon his affinity to him, had importuned him to appoint, his, <persRef
								ref="clagett-clifton">Clagett’s father</persRef>, the present member
							of Congress a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State— Governor Plumer
							had very properly resisted this importunity, upon which Clagett had
							commenced a violent and abusive attack upon him in the Newspapers, and
							had continued it at various times through the whole course of Plumer’s
							administration— All intercourse between the families had consequently
							been broken off, and Plumer when at Portsmouth never would enter
							Clagett’s house; even while his daughter was living— She is now dead—
							Parrott declared that young Clagett’s character was so notoriously
							discreditable; that he was surprized there were found any persons of
							reputation, who would recommend him. <persRef ref="sullivan-george"
								>Sullivan’s</persRef> only reason he though must have been because
							Clagett had read Law in his Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana
							is Chairman of a Committee of the Senate who are making enquiries with a
							view to reduce and retrench the public expeditures— He has been
							obtaining abstracts of the Accounts shewing the amounts of expenditures
								<pb type="ms" n="484"/>in the several Executive Departments at
							various periods of time in 1800. 1808. 1816 and 1820. This disposition
							for retrenchment has arisen from the low state of the revenue, and the
							distressed condition of the country. The Spirit as is natural prevails
							strongly throughout the Union, and is so predominant in Congress, that
							nothing would stand before it, but for advice which has been given them
							to let their economy begin at home— The Legislatures of Rhode-Island and
							New-Hampshire passed resolutions recommending to their Senators, and
							members of the House in Congress, to endeavour to obtain a Law to reduce
							the pay of Members of Congress to six dollars a day, and six dollars for
							every twenty-miles of travel— At the Commencement of the Session, the
							late <persRef ref="burrill-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burrill</persRef> in the Senate, and <persRef ref="eddy-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eddy</persRef> in the House of
							Representatives, members from Rhode-Island offered Resolutions, for such
							reductions, as were recommended by the Legislature of their own State,
							and the way they were met was to connect them with plans of general
							reduction of the Salaries of all Officers in the Executive Departments.
							In the Senate, on motion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana, a
							substitute was adopted instead of Burrill’s Resolution, and a Committee
							of five was appointed to inquire into the propriety of reducing the pay
							of the members of Congress; and also the allowances of all Executive
							Officers, with leave to report by Bill, or otherwise— Dana is the
							Chairman of this Committee, and is making the above-mentioned enquiries
							with a view to the Report— Eddy’s Resolution fared still worse in the
							House of Representatives. The House refused to consider it; but sweeping
							propositions of universal retrenchment, in the army, navy
							fortifications, and executive offices took their places— Dana himself
							does not incline to the reduction of any of the expences of the mere
							administration of the Government, but he is not prepared to meet the
							tide of popular sentiment by direct opposition. His path is by winding
							Stairs— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning came to speak of the
							papers communicated to the House of Representatives, by the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, with his Message relative to
							the Negotiations concerning the Slave trade— There was one passage in a
							despatch from me to <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, which
							I was aware would when published be displeasing to the British
							Government—it was a reflection somewhat pointed, at the principle in the
							Treaty between Great-Britain and the Netherlands, that the Cruizers for
							Slave-traders, of each Nation should be authorized to search vessels of
							the other even under convoy of armed vessels of their own— Canning
							alluded to it in general terms, intimating that he could have wished
							that it had not been included in the communication to Congress— As a
							Letter of Instruction from this Government to its own Minister, he had
							nothing to say of it; but as it was no part of the Communications which
							had passed between the two Governments, it did not seem he said to be
							required by the Call from the House, and containing something like
							censure on the British Government, might have been omitted from Papers
							communicated to Congress for publication. I told him that the Call of
							the House included whatever had been done, by direction of the President
							in this Negotiation; of which the Instruction to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush was a very essential part— That I was not aware of any
							censure in the paper to which he alluded, upon the British Government;
							the allusion was only to an important difference of principle between
							them and us— And the occasion was such as required that we should be
							very explicit in the avowal of our principles— I could assure him there
							was nothing offensive in the intention— He then observed that among the
							papers communicated he had observed that the addresses from both Houses
							of Parliament to the <persRef ref="george-iv">King</persRef>, requesting
							him further to negotiate with the United States for the suppression of
							the Slave-trade, were not included— It had escaped my recollection that
							copies of these addresses had ever been received— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning that I thought they had not— The
							substance of them had been reported in a despatch from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush which is one of the papers sent with
							the Message to the House of Representatives; but the Copies of the
							Addresses themselves I believed had not been received. He said he would
							send me copies of them to-morrow and I promised him that a Supplementary
							Message should be sent with them— Immediately after he left me, I
							examined myself the whole file of Rush’s despatches, and very soon found
							the one enclosing the copies of the addresses. It had been overlooked
								<pb type="ms" n="485"/>by <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> the Chief Clerk of the
							Department, in the search which I had altogether relied upon him to make
							of the papers to be sent in answer to the call of the House— I
							immediately directed copies of them to be made, and as the documents
							with the message have not yet been printed in pamphlet, I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent, if the <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>Speaker of the House</persRef> would consent, that they should be
							sent immediately to the Printers, and added as part of the Documents
							annexed to the Message. This accident is one of those which many times
							have happened from the complicated cause of my own inattention, Brent’s
							ineptitude, and the want of method in the arrangement of business, and
							disposal of papers in the Department. Every such instance of defective
							memory in myself, brings with it humiliating reflections upon my own
							infirmity, while conscious of that, let it at least make me sensible of
							the indulgence due to others. I ought not to have forgotten that these
							papers had been received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush— I
							ought to have examined the whole file of Rush’s despatches myself, for
							the documents to be sent with the message.— We had this Evening our
							weekly tea-party which was fully attended; but <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> who has been these two or three days quite unwell,
							after making an effort to receive the company was obliged to leave the
							drawing-room when they came, and retired to bed— The noise of the
							company, of the music, and the dancing in the adjoining chamber, and the
							room beneath her, aggravated excessively her complaint which was a
							nervous head ache, and after the company were gone, she was extremely
							ill.</p>

								>R. W. Meade</persRef> of Philadelphia, a man, who has been of great
							notoriety in the course of our controversies with Spain, came this
							morning and introduced himself to me at the Office; saying that he was
							the bearer of the Florida Treaty, ratified by the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>. He then took from his
							pocket a large packet addressed to the Spanish Minister, <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>, and said that was the
							Treaty: and that he, Meade had received it from the Messenger, who had
							brought it from Madrid. He was going with it to General Vivés, but had
							determined to come and shew it to me, and give me the first notice of
							its being here— There were circumstances which led me to suspect that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade was mistaken, but as he was an
							entire stranger to me, and a few hours would ascertain the fact, I said
							nothing to him of my suspicions— He asked me if his claim was provided
							for in the Treaty; and said that it was of infinite importance for him
							to know immediately, in order that if it was not, he might without delay
							report to the Spanish Government to obtain payment of it— I said that
							this question had been put to me from many other claimants, and I had
							invariably declined answering it, because whether any particular claim
							was or was not embraced by the provisions of the Treaty was to be
							decided by the Commissioners, upon the terms of the Treaty itself, which
							must speak for and explain itself— My opinion upon it would go for
							nothing— All I could say to him was that I supposed his claim was
							included among those provided for by the Treaty— After Meade left me I
							called at the President’s and told <persRef key="monroe-james"

							ratified Treaty— But I requested the President not to mention it to any

							would cast a ridicule upon the Administration itself. <persRef

							to bear upon this point; but if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs as

						<p><date>13. VI:</date><persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain
								O’Brien</persRef> called at the Office— He has not yet obtained a
							Report from the Committee of Claims upon his petition— The Ship he says
							is a ground on the Missouri bar, and God knows when or how she will be
							got off— They have been three days debating in the House of
							Representatives, whether an entry upon their Journals should be that
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> presented three Memorials of the Legislature “of
							Missouri,” or “of the State of Missouri”—and have taken five times the
							yeas and nays, upon questions arising from the debate. The <persRef
								ref="dougherty-thomas">Clerk</persRef> had made up the Journal with
							the words “State of Missouri” the Speaker had erased the words “the
							State of”— <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef> of Georgia, moved
							to amend the Journal, by reinserting the words “the State of” the vote
							on this question was 76 to 76. and was decided only by the casting vote
							of the <persRef ref="taylor-john">Speaker</persRef> himself. Then there
							were motions to insert the words “the territory of” [“]the late
							territory of” and finally a string of Resolutions offered by <persRef
								ref="reid-robert">R. R. Reid</persRef> of Georgia, declaring the
							rasures made by the Speaker to be alterations, and not corrections of
							the Journal. These are all ebullitions from the heated temper of the
							parties. The actual condition of Missouri is neither that of a State or
							a Territory; but in the very process of the Metamorphosis— The Chrysalis
							between the egg and the butterfly— <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Lee</persRef> called at the Office,
							and shewed me a Letter from <persRef ref="coxe-tench">Tench
								Coxe</persRef> to him, relative to my expected Report on Weights and
							Measures. <persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Amado Grehon</persRef> the Chargé d’Affaires from
							Portugal, came to take leave, intending to return in a few days to
							Philadelphia, where he habitually resides. I received a second Letter
							from <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">R. C. Mallary</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Committee on the Ghent Treaty Commissions. The former Letter was of
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							containing several enquiries, to answer which rendered a thorough
							examination of the records concerning the Commissions under <persRef
								ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay’s</persRef> Treaty
							of 1794, as well as a revisal of all that has been done under the
							present Commissions— Many papers were also to be copied and sent to the
							Committee— I was not yet prepared to answer the Letter, of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> when that of this day came, referring to
							it, and expressing an apprehension that I had not received it— I was at
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and mentioned
							these enquiries to him— There was an agreement signed by him and by
								<persRef ref="baker-anthony">A. S. J. Baker</persRef>, at the
							Exchange of the Ratifications of the Treaty of Ghent, respecting the
							Salaries of the Commissioners; but it was not explicit as to their
							amount; which <pb type="ms" n="488"/>is precisely the question now to be
							determined— The President’s recollection is that it was understood the
							Salaries of the Commissioners should be the same as were those of the
							Commissioners under the Treaty of 1794—but under that Treaty there were
							three Commissions and the Salaries of the Commissioners were not all the
							same— There is therefore a difficulty in the subject not easily to be
							removed. An incident occurred this evening in my family which gave me
							great concern and vexation. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> yet not wholly
							recovered from her severe illness, had been however well enough to dine
							with us. After dinner between 8 and 9 in the Evening, we were sitting
							together by the fire— I was reading a Newspaper. <persRef
								ref="johnson-fanny">Fanny Johnson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>, with our Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> were playing Cards, when there was a loud knock at
							our Street door, and a note was brought in and delivered to George, with
							word left by the servant who brought it that it required immediate
							answer— George immediately left the table, called <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> out of the room and
							after a few minutes went out of the house alone— Johnson Hellen came
							back, and I enquired whom the Note was from— He said from <persRef
								ref="martin-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin</persRef>—
							I asked where George was gone— He said to <persRef ref="strother-john"
								>Strother’s</persRef>. I was deeply agitated, but suppressed every
							appearance of emotion. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams controuled
							her feelings also; Johnson Hellen took George’s Cards and the game
							continued. In about half an hour, George came back— His mother shortly
							afterwards went to her chamber, where she sent for him, and he told her
							what had passed between him and Martin— She asked me then to converse
							with him and advise him— I called him to my chamber, where he first
							intreated me not to interfere authoritatively between him and Martin,
							and then shewed me Martin’s Note, which was in these words;—“M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> R. N. Martin solicits the company of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Adams, at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Strother’s on business, and presumes, if he be not engaged
							the pleasure will be granted without delay.— Saturday Evening.” George
							said that on receiving this Note his first impression was to ask Johnson
							Hellen to go with him— But on reflection he had concluded to go alone,
							and unarmed— At Strother’s on asking for Martin he had been shewn to a
							private room, where he was alone, with a horse-whip on the table— To
							shew him that he had noticed this Circumstance, George said to him, “I
							see you have been riding.”— Martin then after some formal civilities
							said that he had it from the most unquestionable authority that George
							had told a Lady that a Gentleman had assured him that Martin had told
							that Gentleman, that the Lady was engaged to be married to him—Martin—
							That it was scarcely possible for him to believe this; but if it was so
							he should expect from George, either an apology or the satisfaction of a
							Gentleman— George said he had answered him—M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Martin the Lady of whom you speak is Miss Fanny Johnson, and
							the Gentleman is <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> H. G. Otis</persRef>— I shall make you no apology, for I
							have done no wrong— I never said what you say you have been told I did.
							I never said to any one that I had been told you said Miss Johnson was
							engaged to you; but in casual conversation at <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales’s</persRef>,
							the question being asked if she was, I said that from your conduct
							towards her I supposed she was—and afterwards one Evening at my
							father’s, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis having observed that it
							was reported there was such an engagement, I said I believed there was
							not— Miss Mary Hellen who was present said she suspected there was; on
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis asked whether you said there
							was; Miss Hellen answered no. These are the facts, and for this I have
							no apology to make; and shall make none— Upon which Martin said as to
							any inference which any person chose to draw from his conduct, he took
							no offence at that— He was entirely satisfied with the explanation
							George had given him, which was entirely conformable to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis’s statement of the circumstances to
							him— That he was going in a day or two to Baltimore, and perhaps might
							in the interval see Miss Johnson again— He wished George to consider
							nothing as having passed between them; but in a very emphatic, and
							assuming tone had requested him to spare the feelings of Miss Johnson,
							upon which George answered that he should “treat Miss Johnson with the
							respect due from him to a person who was under his father’s roof;” and
							left him— George then observed that if Fanny Johnson had reported to
							Martin, what he had alledged, it was in the first place not true; and in
							the second, no very becoming thing on her part; as she could not be
							ignorant of its tendency to breed a quarrel— He should ask her to-morrow
							Morning whether she ever had told Martin, as he represented it, and if
							she had, and should persist in the assertion, or equivocate in the
							answer, this affair must go further. I told him, that it would be better
							for some third person to ascertain from Fanny Johnson, whether she had
							told Martin what he had asserted— I said I was glad as it had turned out
							that he went immediately, alone and unarmed <pb type="ms" n="489"/>on
							receiving the note from Martin; but that Martin’s mode of proceeding was
							in every respect improper— That there was a studied ostentation in
							sending the Note, with a demand by the servant of an immediate answer;
							which he knew would in all probability be delivered in the presence of
							the family. He knew it could not but alarm the female part of the
							family— It looked as if he hoped I should interfere to forbid George
							from answering his call, that he might afterwards turn it to the account
							of his own Spirit, and against George. But his sending for George to
							come to him, in the Night, to a tavern, to give him an explanation, or
							fight him, was a piece of unparalleled insolence— I was glad that George
							had taken his own course without consulting me; but that if on receiving
							the Note he had asked my advice, I should have recommended to him to
							answer, that for any <hi rend="italic">business</hi> which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin might wish to transact with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W. Adams, the latter would be happy to
							receive him at his residence in his fathers house, or at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin’s option, at any other suitable
							place, in the presence of a mutual friend— If this affair should proceed
							further I enjoined upon George, not to go to Martin again alone, nor to
							have any conversation with him, but in the presence of a third person,
							and a fourth if Martin chose— On leaving George to retire to bed, I
							found that Mary Hellen had been taken suddenly ill, and after a long
							fainting fit, was in bed with severe cramps, a high fever, and
							delirious. <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> was immediately sent for, and soon after came. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was up with her till two in the
							Morning, when her illness abated and she fell asleep— Fanny Johnson was
							with her.</p>

							then drew up the question in writing, and gave the paper to M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, to give to Fanny, with a request
							that she would answer it, at the bottom of the paper, and sign her name.
							I attended Church at the Capitol, and heard <persRef
								ref="ryland-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ryland</persRef>, the Chaplain of the Senate. I then called at <persRef
								ref="claxton-elizabeth">Claxton’s</persRef> on <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							tell him that I should answer it as soon as the copies could be made out
							of the documents to be sent with the answer. He said he had written his
							second Letter, only from an apprehension that I might not have received
							the first— I saw at Claxton’s several others of the members who lodge
							there, and heard of the illness of several others— <persRef
								ref="meech-ezra">Meech</persRef> of Vermont has a fever. <persRef
								ref="dewitt-jacob">De Witt</persRef> of New-York lies yet, of very
							doubtful recovery— <persRef ref="overstreet-james">Overstreet</persRef>
							of South Carolina, is dangerously bruised in the head by the oversetting
							of a Carriage; and <persRef ref="jones-francis">Jones</persRef> of
							Tennessee has a hurt by falling after dinner into a cellar— Returning
							home, I called on the way at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S.
								Smith’s</persRef>, and saw his <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">wife</persRef>— When I came home on
							going in to the parlour I found Martin, with Fanny Johnson, sitting in
							tête à tête, and from the appearance of her eyes she had been in tears—
							I took a seat, and after a few minutes waiting, Martin rose, and said,
							“Miss Johnson, I shall see you again before I go— In the meantime, I
							pray you to be assured, that whatever may happen, I shall always
							entertain for you the sentiments of a friend and a brother.” As he was
							going to the door, I said to him; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin,
							it is with extreme reluctance, and with great pain that I feel myself
							compelled to say to you what I now do— If you have any further
							conversation to hold with Miss Johnson, I have to request it may not be
							in my house— He said there were circumstances of which he hoped that
							when I came to be informed, I should be induced not to repeat that
							request— I replied that there was no circumstance could justify the
							intrusion upon the privacy and the outrage upon the peace of my family,
							by the manner in which he had sent a Summons to my Son, to go to him at
							a tavern last Evening— He said, surely his proceeding towards my Son had
							been both respectful and polite— He had merely <hi rend="italic"
								>solicited</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> of his Company,
							if he was not engaged— Sir, said I, this is not a case of special
							pleading at a County Court— With any question between you and my Son, I
							have no concern; my Sons conduct must depend upon himself— It is your
							calling him out of my house in a manner, which in its nature must spread
							alarm and consternation among the women <pb type="ms" n="490"/>which is
							offensive to me, and so offensive that I can take no pleasure in
							receiving at my house any person, capable of such conduct— He said no
							more, but went off— I found afterwards to my great surprize that Fanny
							Johnson instead of immediately answering the written paper, which I had
							left, had requested that Martin might be sent for to have this private
							interview with him. She afterwards wrote at the bottom of the paper that
							she did not tell Martin that which Martin had imputed to him, and signed

						<p><date>15. VIII:</date> Having had no sleep the night before last, the
							last Night was the longer, and for many months I have not risen so late
							as this morning. <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dickinson</persRef> called here and introduced a young
							man from New-York, by the name of <persRef ref="hone-unknown"
								>Hone</persRef>.— While he was here, <persRef ref="otis-harrison"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. G. Otis</persRef> called, but
							supposing me to be engaged, left word that he wished to see me on the
							part of <persRef ref="martin-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Martin</persRef>— As I was going out, I met at the door <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>,
							with a young man from Philadelphia, by the name of <persRef
								ref="rogers-unknown">Rogers</persRef>, whom he introduced— I went
							with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> to the Senate chamber,
							to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis— He was engaged in business
							there, but told me that he would call on me at the Department, after the
							adjournment of the Senate, which he did— He then said that Martin had
							called upon him yesterday, apparently in great irritation, and
							complained that I had forbidden him my house; and had requested him to
							see me, and to assure me of the propriety of his conduct. He had related
							to him what had passed the Evening before, between him and my Son
							George— Told him that he had been perfectly satisfied with George’s
							explanation and had considered it as an affair entirely settled— He had
							therefore been astonished at the offence which I had taken, and had
							wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis to say to me, that Martin’s
							conduct had only been such as the vindication of his own honour
							required— He said that it had been his intention to treat my Son George
							with the utmost civility, and delicacy— That the note he had written to
							him was in the most respectful and friendly language, and that his
							motive in sending for George to meet him alone at <persRef
								ref="strother-john">Strother’s</persRef> was precisely to avoid
							every appearance of formality; and to confine his request for an
							explanation, entirely between themselves. Otis then proceeded to tell me
							of his acquaintance with Martin, who lodges and messes at the same house
							with him at Georgetown— Martin he said was first introduced to him by
								<persRef ref="goldsborough-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goldsborough</persRef> formerly a Senator from Maryland, and a
							relation of Martin’s— On his coming here this winter, Otis had heard
							that he had come in pursuit of a young Lady, whom her friends had sent
							here to be out of his way— He had observed that at one of <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams’s</persRef> weekly parties, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Martin did not come—that at a subsequent one he proposed to come, and
							did come with him; not without some apprehension on Otis’s part, that he
							might be thought by us to be introduced by him— Afterwards the incidents
							occurred at <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales’s</persRef> and at my
							house, which gave rise to this affair with George and which Otis related
							to the minutest point exactly as George had told them to me— But last
							Saturday Otis said, Martin had come to him in a state of high excitement
							and told him he had been informed that my Son George had reported his
							having been told by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis, that Martin had
							asserted to him that there was an engagement of marriage between
								<persRef ref="johnson-fanny">Miss Johnson</persRef> and himself.
							Otis said he had told Martin he was sure there must be some mistake in
							the matter— He had never said so to my Son, and he was confident George
							never had reported from him, what he had not said— And he had then told
							Martin the incidents which did occur, and from which this
							misunderstanding appeared to have arisen, as he now told them to me.
							Martin had then left him, and yesterday came to him again with his new
							complaint— He seemed to hope that I should upon being informed of all
							the Circumstances, acquit him of any intention of disrespect to me, and
							revoke the interdiction to him of my house. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis that I was disposed to make every
							proper allowance, for the excesses of a young man who appeared to be
							frantic with passion. But the peace, and quiet and health of my family
							had been too grossly outraged by Martin, to be forgiven on a mere
							declaration by him that he intended no disrespect— As to his call for an
							explanation upon my Son, I had told him I should not interpose in that—
							But in the first place the young Lady herself explicitly denies, not
							only that George ever said to her what Martin called upon him to
							explain, but that she ever told Martin, that George had made such a
							report to her. George therefore had never said any thing which <pb
								type="ms" n="491"/>Martin had any right to call upon him to explain—
							Martin had done him precisely the injury which he had complained of
							having received from him. He had imputed to him a false report, upon
							allegations themselves false— And as to his forms of proceeding; his
							plea of polite language was ridiculous— I repeated the terms of the
							Note—the summons upon <hi rend="italic">business</hi>, and without
							delay; the direct intimation to him at Strother’s, with a horse-whip on
							the table, that he had it from the most unquestionable authority that
							George had said so and so—and if he had that he must retract it or fight
							him— Here was an avowed unequivocal, contingent challenge—given upon
							false pretences—and sent in a manner, as if purposely intended to alarm
							my whole family— I was not much versed in the forms appropriate to the
							code of honourable murder, but of this I was sure; they never authorized
							a Gentleman to send for another to come to him in the Night at a tavern,
							alone to give him an explanation, or to fight him— As to the report that
							Fanny Johnson had been sent by her friends to my house to keep her out
							of Martin’s way, it was quite groundless. She was here at the earnest
							invitation of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, and myself; being
							an orphan Grand-daughter of the late <persRef ref="johnson-thomas"
								>Governor Thomas Johnson</persRef>, of Fredericktown, Maryland, and
							daughter to <persRef ref="johnson-elizabeth">a first Cousin</persRef> of
							my wife’s— Martin had visited at my house, as many other Strangers do,
							in the Winter, and had been invited to M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							Adams’s weekly parties. After what had taken place, his company at my
							house could no longer be acceptable; and as to his assuming to enjoin
							upon my son George to spare the feelings of Miss Johnson, in my opinion
							he would have been better employed, in enjoining it more effectually
							upon himself— Otis said he had suggested himself to Martin, that
							delicacy to the young Lady would not consist in making her a subject of
							public talk— That the circumstances which I had mentioned presented a
							case very materially different from that stated by Martin— He understood
							that I would not re-admit Martin to my house, but upon his
							acknowledgment that he had been wrong. He, Otis could therefore no
							longer with any usefulness interfere in the affair— Martin had asked him
							for a certificate of the propriety of his conduct, but he should now
							excuse himself from taking any further part whatever in the transaction—
							And with this he left me— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Claims, asking further explanations upon the subject of
								<persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien’s</persRef> case—

									>r</hi> John G. Jackson</persRef>, whom I knew formerly as a

							of Congress from North Carolina, came to the Office, with papers
							relating to a claim of one of his constituents upon the British
							Government; either for services during the seven years War; or as a
							loyalist during that of our Revolution— Burton wished <persRef

							be requested to make all necessary enquiries to ascertain the
							circumstances amount, and present state of this claim. He said he felt
							some awkwardness, at having any agency to support a claim for services
							against our own cause in the War of the Revolution; but that was now so
							long past, that it might be overlooked; and as the man was actually one
							of his Constituents, he had a right to any proper assistance that he
							could give him, to obtain his lawful claims even upon the British
							Government— I thought the better of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Burton, both for his scruple, and for his solution of it. <persRef

								ref="obrien-richard">O’Brien’s</persRef> claim, and one from
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General Samuel Smith</persRef> Chairman
							of the Committee of Ways and Means— He enquires whether an appropriation
							to pay for a third picture of <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi

							dispensed with for the present year— And also whether the appropriation

							Minister here; the <persRef ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef>
							having sailed for Europe last November. This is a part of the system of
							retrenchment which is so predominant in Congress, upon every article of
							expenditure which does not touch the pay of the members themselves.— I
							am answering General S. Smith that both items named by him; may without
							expected material injury, be omitted from the appropriations of the

							have invited a large party to dine with me at five— <hi rend="italic">I

							great variety of topics, political and literary; but not upon any thing
							of business— As on other occasions I gave him with more freedom than
							caution my own opinions, while he was exceedingly reserved and discreet
							in the expression of his own— There is danger to a man in my station in
							holding such conversations; yet I do not even upon such occasions speak
							without motive. As I know that the substance of all that I say upon
							political topics will be reported to the Government of the man to whom I
							speak. I express such opinions, as being really mine, may so far as they
							can possibly have any influence, promote the interest of my Country, or
							the cause of truth, virtue and liberty— The danger is two-fold; first of
							being misunderstood; and secondly of being misrepresented; and it would
							perhaps be wiser, to keep all foreign Ministers more at a distance, and
							talk with them upon nothing but business, or the weather— <persRef

							Walking round to my Office I met <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">T.

							Secretary of War, by <persRef ref="floyd-john">John Floyd</persRef>, a
							member from Virginia— The example had already been set by <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>, who owes Calhoun an

							arresting the Yellow Stone river expedition is now systematically
							pursued, by a Coalition of all the partizans of <persRef

								Crawford</persRef>, of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>, and of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> in the House— The
							falling off in the revenue has stirred up the Spirit of economy and
							retrenchment, and as the expenditures of the War Department are those
							upon which the most considerable reduction can be made, it is at them
							that the economists level their first, and principal batteries.
							Individual personal jealousies, envies, and resentments, partizan
							ambitions, and private interests and hopes, mingle in the motives which
							prompt this policy— About one half the members of Congress, are seekers
							for Office at the nomination of the President— Of the remainder, at
							least one half, have some appointment or favour to ask for their
							relatives;—but there are two modes of obtaining their ends; one by
							subserviency, and the other by opposition— These may be called the
							cringing canvass and the flouting canvass— As the public opinion is most
							watchful of the <pb type="ms" n="493"/>cringing canvass, the flouters
							are in fact the most numerous party— This D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Floyd is one of the flouters— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> gave me yesterday to read a paper which this
							man has prepared as Chairman of a Committee; being a Report urging an
							immediate settlement, and territorial Establishment at the Mouth of
							Columbia river, and a total change of our system of intercourse and
							trade with the Indians— Floyd had put it into the President’s hands,
							with a request that he would suggest any alterations that he might think
							desirable— I returned the paper this morning to the President, who asked
							me, what I thought of it— I told him I could recommend no alteration—
							The paper was a tissue of errors in fact, and abortive reasoning, of
							invidious reflections, and rude invectives— There was nothing could
							purify it but the fire— The President told me he had been informed that
							the Columbia river settlement project, was for the benefit of a man
							named <persRef ref="preston-john">Preston</persRef>, a brother in Law of
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd’s, who was Treasurer of the
							State of Virginia, and about a year since was detected in the
							embezzlement of the funds of the State, and was a delinquent to the
							amount of many thousand dollars. This had so disgraced him in reputation
							that a retreat to Columbia river was thought expedient for him by his
							friends, and as his near relatives shared something of the ignominy
							which had attached to him, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Floyd probably
							intended to be of the Columbia river party too— There was a dancing
							party this Evening at <persRef ref="tayloe-john">Col<hi

								>Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer this morning at 6 degrees below

								<persRef ref="randolph-thomas">Thomas Mann Randolph</persRef>, the
							present Governor of Virginia whose <persRef ref="hackley-virginia"
								>sister </persRef>he married— He also asks an allowance as payment
							of expences for having brought last Spring despatches from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>
							at Madrid. Forsyth himself recommended that some such compensation
							should be made to him— <persRef ref="dana-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana</persRef> the Senator from
							Connecticut came to make further enquiries concerning the expenditures
							in the Executive Departments. He said after his manner—“it is my opinion
							that the expenditures in the Executive Departments are very extravagant;
							and now what have you to say in defence of them?— I answered in the same
							tone—but before you put me upon my defence, please to specify to which
							of the Departments, and in what the charge of extravagance consists.— To
							all the Departments; and the special charge consists in the increased
							amount of expenditures in each Department— The expences in the War and
							Treasury Departments for instance, are in the year 1820. three times as
							great as they were in 1800. In the Department of State they are
							increased not in the same proportion; but are about doubled— I then
							said, as to the increase in the other Departments, I must leave the
							defence of them, which would be very easy, to their respective heads— It
							would be enough for me to defend my own dominions. As to the increase in
							the Department of State, a small part of it was occasioned by an
							augmentation of the Salaries of the Officers employed in it. That of the
							Secretary had been only of two years standing; as the Salary now is, my
							individual and domestic expences, exceed it from four to five thousand
							dollars every year; and as a reduction of it would only increase by so
							much the contribution, which I pay for serving the public, if in the
							consideration of Congress that sacrifice be necessary for an alleviation
							to the burthens of the Country, I am quite prepared to acquiesce in it—
							But I should regret any reduction of the Salaries of the Clerks, because
							none could be made, which in amount, could be any object to the Nation,
							and because the best of them gave no more than a comfortable subsistence
							to the holders; and none were adequate compensation for the
							qualifications which <pb type="ms" n="494"/>to be fit for the Offices
							they ought to possess— But the great increase of expence was owing to
							the increase of the Country and of the duties to be performed at the
							Department— The foreign correspondence indeed remained much the same now
							as it was in 1800— The only difference was a legation in Russia now,
							instead of a Legation in Prussia then; and an additional Chargé
							d’Affaires now in Sweden— But the interior correspondence then was with
							sixteen States; it is now with twenty-four— It was then with a
							population of less than five, and now of more than nine Millions: to
							which must be added the increase of the inquisitive Spirit in Congress—
							At that time there were in Congress, about 130 Members— There are now
							upwards of 230. Then two or three Octavo, and one Folio Volume,
							constituted all the documents printed at a Session— Now there are from
							fifteen to twenty volumes published every year— There assuredly five
							calls from Congress for information and documents from the Departments,
							for one that there was then— Every call requires a Report, and every
							call gives copying employment for Clerks. Congress three years ago,
							allowed two additional copying Clerks; but they required in addition to
							all the current business the copying and publication of five large
							volumes— One the Journal of the federal Convention of 1787. One the
							Digest of foreign Commercial Regulations; and three of Secret Journals
							of the Old Congress.— I then informed him how the business was
							distributed in the Department; and of the employment of the several
							Clerks, and told him that instead of having superfluous hands, I wanted
							one or two more, and should certainly ask of Congress appropriations for
							them were it not that in their present retrenching disposition, it is
							doubtful whether they will even leave me those that I have— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana professed himself to be satisfied
							with my defence, which in fact he did not need for himself; but he said
							he should use the information I had given him at the proper time and
							place. We had a party of young men to dine with us by the invitation of

							who arrived in the City yesterday paid us a visit this morning. At the
							Office, I had a visit from <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Manuel Torres</persRef>, styled the
							Charge d’Affaires from the Republic of Colombia. He came as usual to ask
							for an acknowledgment of the Republic, a Loan of money, and a supply of
							arms— I told him it was to be expected from the armistice lately
							concluded between the Generals <persRef ref="bolivar-simon"
								>Bolivar</persRef> and <persRef ref="morillo-pablo"
								>Morillo</persRef> that the Republic would soon be acknowledged by
							all the world—and that I hoped under these circumstances his Country
							would henceforth need neither loan of money nor supply of arms. I
							enquired if he had received any new instructions from his Government,
							since the armistice—and whether he had been informed how it came to be
							made— He had no new instructions, not even to inform him of the
							armistice— He supposed it was a sort of capitulation to permit Morillo
							and the Spaniards to evacuate the Country— There was no doubt that if
							the War had continued the Patriots would by this time have been in
							possession of Carthagena; but there must have been sharp fighting for
							it; and if it had been taken by force, the inhabitants must have
							suffered very severely by the operation— The danger of this would have
							been the greater, because there had been of late numerous desertions
							from the Spanish army to the Patriots— These deserters immediately
							joined the Patriot service, and having neither interest nor personal
							connection with the Country, their real object was plunder; and they
							cared not from which party of the inhabitants. Bolivar had already found
							them very troublesome, and was probably apprehensive of having them come
							over to him in larger numbers— It was neither his policy nor the
							interest of the Patriots that the Inhabitants of the places in
							possession of the Spaniards <pb type="ms" n="495"/>should suffer,
							because after all the Country itself would suffer by their injuries.
							This explanation of the armistice is very plausible, and may be correct—
							But it does not accord with the very formal written communication lately
							made to me lately by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres, in which the
							very proposals for an armistice made by the Spanish commanders were
							represented as insidious, because they were addressed at the same time
							to the Congress, and to different Generals distant from each other, and
							the most positive assurances were given that no armistice would be
							agreed to, without a distinct acknowledgment of Independence.— I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres that at-all events I was much
							gratified to observe the other Convention between the two Generals
							stipulating, that if the war should be renewed it should be conducted
							upon the principles of legitimate warfare— <persRef ref="evans-hugh"

						<p><date>22. V:30.</date><persRef ref="allison-burgess">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Allison</persRef> called upon me this
							morning— He is an old Baptist Clergyman, who was a chaplain in our army
							during the revolutionary War— Having no talent for public speaking he
							has not been successful in his calling; has no parish or permanent
							church, and even the House of Representatives, who for several Sessions
							chose him in charity for their chaplain have dropped him at this
							Session. He is in very needy circumstances, and has long been a
							candidate for the appointment of Superintendent of the patent Office, in
							case of the removal of <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> by an appointment
							to South-America— But he came now to tell me, that he was the
							Vice-President of the general Association of Baptist Ministers
							throughout the United States— That this office gave him a very extensive
							political influence—because this Association held annual meetings, and
							although they had no direct discussion of political subjects, yet there
							was much conversation among the members concerning public men, and
							public affairs, and it was in his power to exercise great influence over
							the opinions of the members, a power which would be much enlarged, with
							some small assistance of money— That as the second Election of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe as
								President</persRef> of the United States was now completed, it was
							natural to look forward to the next Presidential term, and enquire who
							would be the fittest person for his successor. That he had reflected
							much upon this subject, and had come to the conclusion that I was the
							most suitable person; and that he should be disposed to exercise all his
							influence in my favour— I tendered him my thanks for <pb type="ms"
								n="496"/>his good opinion, and told him I could make him no better
							return for it, than to give him a candid and explicit statement of my
							principles. I did not know that it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s intention to retire from public life, at the expiration of his
							second Presidential term— If he should not decline a third re-election I
							should not consent were it even in my power to have my name held up as a
							candidate in opposition to him— If he should decline, and my life and
							health after four years remain as at present, I shall with others be
							before the Nation to be disposed of as they may think proper— If others
							should be disposed to hold me up as a candidate for the suffrages of my
							Country, I shall not as at present advised, withhold my name; but I
							shall neither solicit the nomination or take any part whatever in
							procuring or supporting it— The Doctor said he thought the principle
							which I had determined to pursue entirely correct, and that his own
							purposes, as he had mentioned them were all founded upon the presumption
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe would decline another
							re-election, as he should not wish to support any other person in
							opposition to him— The Doctor then, apparently, but I believe not really

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> the British
							Minister called at the Office, and intimating that he came to have some
							conversation with me in his official character, observed that having
							been some days since present at a debate in the House of Representatives
							he had heard some observations made by <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson</persRef> of Virginia,
							importing a design in the Government of this Country to form some new
							Settlement on the South Sea— That he should not particularly have
							noticed this; but that in the National Intelligencer of this morning, a
							Paper generally considered as partaking in some sort of an official
							character, there was a publication signed by <persRef ref="eaton-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton</persRef>, a member of the
							Senate, which was a part of the Executive Government, and which
							disclosed an avowed project for such a Settlement on the pacific Ocean—
							He had therefore thought it his duty to call upon me and enquire what
							were the intentions of the Government in this respect— The personal
							communications between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning and me
							hitherto had all been of a character so conciliatory and friendly, that
							although much surprized both at the form and substance of this address,
							I answered him that I had not read the publication of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton; nor had I heard of the remark which
							he mentioned to have been made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson—
							That I was not acquainted with the opinions of those Members of Congress
							on this subject; but from a prevailing disposition in the Country; it
							was very probable that our Settlement at the Mouth of Columbia river
							would at no remote period be increased— He immediately assumed an air
							widely different from that of the easy familiarity with which the
							Conversation had commenced and with a tone more peremptory than I was
							disposed to endure said he was greatly surprized at receiving this
							answer. With a corresponding change of tone, I told him he could not be
							more surprized than I was both at the form and substance of his address
							on this occasion— [“]And am I to understand this (said he) as the
							determination of the American Government”? “No Sir (said I) you are to
							understand nothing as the determination of the American Government, that
							I say to you, without consultation with, and directions from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. What I have now
							said to you is merely an opinion of my own”— He then repeated that he
							was greatly surprized to hear it as he conceived such a Settlement would
							be a direct violation of the<space/>Article of the Convention of 20.
							October 1818. I immediately rose from my Seat, to look for the Volume of
							the Laws of the United States which contained the Convention— While I
							was looking for it, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning said it was
							not his wish to take me upon this subject by surprize, and that if it
							would be more agreeable to me he would call upon me some other day—
							Without replying to this remark, having found the book I resumed my
							Seat, and after reading audibly the Article of the Convention respecting
							the boundary, said, “now Sir, if you have any charge to make against the
							American Government, for a violation of this Article you will please to
							make the communication in writing”— He then said with great
							vehemence—“and do you suppose, Sir, that I am to be dictated to, in the
							manner, in which I may think proper to communicate with the American
							Government?”— I answered, “No Sir—we know very well what are the
							privileges of foreign Ministers, and mean to respect them— But you will
							give us leave to determine what communications we will receive, and how
							we will receive them; and you may be assured we are as little disposed
							to submit to dictation as to exercise it[”]— He then in a louder and
							more passionate tone of voice said—[“]and am I to understand, that I am
							to be refused henceforth any conference with you on the business of my
							Mission”? “Not at all, Sir, said I— My request is that if you have any
							thing further to say to me, <hi rend="italic">upon this subject</hi> you
							would say it in writing— And my motive is to avoid what, both from the
							nature of the subject, and from the manner in which you have thought
							proper to open it, I foresee will tend only to mutual irritation, and
							not to an amicable arrangement.”— With some abatement of the tone, but
							in the same peremptory manner he said—“am I to understand that you
							refuse any further conference with me, <hi rend="italic">on this
								subject</hi>[”]?— I said “No— But you will understand that I am not
							pleased either with the grounds upon which you have sought this
							conference, nor with the questions which you have seen fit to put to me—
							The only foundation upon which you rest your application is a remark
							made by a member of Congress in a debate: and a publication of another
							member of Congress in a Newspaper— The Members of the <pb type="ms"
								n="499"/>Legislature of this Country are not only perfectly
							independent of the Executive; but the Executive cannot permit itself to
							be questioned by any foreign Minister, upon any thing said or done by
							them— And as little do I admit your right to ask any question of our
							intentions with regard to the Mouth of Columbia river”— “What then (said
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning,) was the meaning of the
							Article in the Convention, which you have just read”?— “Its true meaning
							I suppose to be, that both parties considered the whole subject not
							worth disputing about; but after the British Government had sent out a
							public ship with express orders to make a formal surrender to us, of the
							Post at the Mouth of the Columbia river, which had been taken during the
							late War, and after that restoration had been thus made, we certainly
							did expect that we should hear nothing further from them on that
							subject; we thought they had made up their minds concerning it; and it
							forebodes no good to the harmony between the two Countries if they have
							not”— (Canning) “I have understood that the transaction during the War,
							was rather a transfer of property between individuals than a capture—
							The property of the American settlement which had been made before was
							purchased by British Merchants from Canada— The order to restore the
							place was given, to put things in the same condition that they had been
							in before the War, but could have no effect on the question of title. It
							was therefore my duty to make this application to the American
							Government: a duty the more urgent, when it was considered that in 1817.
							the American ship of War Ontario was sent out, without any notice to the
							British Minister at Washington[”]— (He said this in a very emphatic
							manner, and as if there had been an intended secret expedition in the
							fitting out of the Ontario, which had been only detected by the
							vigilance and penetration of the British Minister— I answered) “why,
								<persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef> did say something to me about it; but I certainly
							did not think him serious, and we had a good humoured, laughing
							conversation on the occasion.” (Canning, with great vehemence) “You may
							rely upon it, Sir, that it was no laughing matter to him; for I have
							seen his report of it to his Government, and know what his feelings
							concerning it were.” (I replied) “This is the first intimation I have
							ever received that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot took the
							slightest offence at what then passed between us— There never to my
							recollection at any time passed a word in anger between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot and me; and you will give me leave
							to say that when he left this Country[”]— (here, I was going to add that
							the last words he said to me were words of thanks for the invariable
							urbanity and liberality of my conduct, and the personal kindness which
							he had uniformly received from me—but I could not finish the sentence—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning in a paroxysm of extreme
							irritation, broke out) “I stop you there— I will not endure a
							misrepresentation of what I say— I never said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot took offence at any thing that had
							passed between him and you; and nothing that I said imported any such
							thing[”]—then after a pause of a few moments he added in the same
							passionate manner— “I am treated like a Schoolboy.”— I then resumed—
								“M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, I have a distinct
							recollection of the substance of the short Conversation between M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot and me at that time, and it was
							this”— “No doubt Sir,” said Canning, interrupting me again—“no doubt
							Sir, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot answered you like a man of
							good breeding, and good humour”— “He came (said I) and remarked that he
							had heard the Ontario, Sloop of War had been despatched to take
							possession of the Mouth of Columbia river and expressed some surprize
							that notice had not been given of it to him— I told him it had happened
							accidentally, just before I came into the Office, and during the absence
							of the President— It was merely to resume possession of a place which
							had been held by American Citizens before the War, and which had been
							taken during the War— It was simply to take again our own property— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot then asked whether we did not
							consider Great-Britain as having a claim there— I answered no—what claim
							could she have? He replied, don’t you think we derive some claim from
								<persRef ref="drake-francis">Sir Francis Drake</persRef>? Methinks
							said I, you may as well claim the whole Eastern shore of this Continent
							by title from <persRef ref="cabot-sebastian">Sebastian Cabot</persRef>—
							No, said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot <hi rend="italic">that
								question is settled</hi>—and here the Conversation ended— I never
							heard a word more from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot on the
							subject, and <pb type="ms" n="500"/>very soon afterwards, <persRef
								ref="hickey-frederick">Captain Hickey</persRef> of the Blossom, by
							express orders from the British Government went purposely to the
							Columbia river, and there solemnly delivered possession to <persRef
								ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prevost</persRef>,
							the Agent of the American Government, of the place in faithful execution
							of the stipulation in the Treaty of Ghent— By the Article afterwards, in
							the Convention of 20 October 1818 we had agreed that all the Ports and
							Places West of the Stony Mountains should lie open for ten years to both
							parties, an engagement which on our side will be scrupulously fulfilled,
							but of any claim of Great-Britain, supported by a shadow of evidence at
							the Negotiation of the Convention, I never heard”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, while I was speaking had now
							grown cooler, and seemed to be surprized that there had been no
							discussion of claims to territory on the South Sea, at the Negotiation
							of the Convention of October 1818. He said he had understood that the
							British Government considered the taking of the Settlement on Columbia
							river during the War, as merely a transaction between private
							individuals, and that the restoration of it by Captain Hickey was only
							to place things in the same state in which they had been before the War—
							But that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot had been ordered <hi
								rend="italic">verbally</hi> to require an explanation of the
							proceeding of the American Government in sending the Ontario without
							notice to him, and had been referred to a previous correspondence on the
							subject between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>—
							I said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot had not to my
							recollection spoken to me of this affair more than once; but that he
							certainly had never required any explanation from me after hearing from
							his Government concerning the Expedition of the Ontario.— It was
							therefore with extreme surprize that I found him, Canning, starting a
							question of our right to Columbia river, and the manner of his address,
							had been equally unexpected— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning then
							again with much warmth asserted his right to be the only judge of the
							manner of his proceedings— I said that on former occasions, from the
							great respect which he had avowed for this Government, and the
							conciliatory disposition which he had manifested, I had perhaps thrown
							off in conversation with him some of that cautious reserve which in our
							respective Stations might have been strictly regular. But that he was
							not to infer from that a right to question me in a manner to which I
							would not submit from any other foreign Minister. So long as his
							professions had been supported by his conduct . . . Here M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning again stopped me by repeating with
							great vehemence . . . “my conduct!— I am responsible for my conduct only
							to my own Government”— I replied that we understood fully the rights and
							privileges of a foreign Minister, and meant that he should enjoy them—
							But we knew also the right of every Government receiving a foreign
							Minister to judge of the propriety of his conduct towards them, and
							should not relinquish it. But it was quite unnecessary, and would be
							worse than useless to pursue this discussion, as a question of personal
							conduct between him and me— It would be best to confine ourselves in
							future to the subject which concerned the two Governments, and my own
							opinion was that the best mode of treating it would be in writing— He
							said that for his part he was perfectly willing to forget all that had
							now passed— I told him that I neither asked nor promised him to forget—
							I could not forbear entertaining my opinions; nor did I wish him to
							forbear entertaining his— He asked again if he was to understand me, as
							refusing to confer with him further on this subject— I said no— Would I
							appoint a time for that purpose?— I said now, if he pleased— I was ready
							to hear any thing that he had to say to me concerning it— But as he
							appeared to be under some excitement, perhaps he might prefer some other
							time; in which case, I would readily receive him to-morrow at one
							O’Clock; upon which he rose, and took leave; saying he would come at
							that time— Immediately after this Conversation I went over to the
							President’s, and reported the substance of it to him— He said he thought
							it impossible that the policy of the British Government should at this
							time be, to seek causes of dispute with us. He supposed that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning wished to make a merit with his
							Government of his zeal, but he thought he would be cooler <pb type="ms"
								n="501"/>to-morrow, after sleeping upon it. He must see that he was
							wrong in questioning the Executive upon what was said or published by
							Members of Congress, and it was hardly to be expected that his
							Government would countenance him in it. The President also desired me in
							the Conference to-morrow, to be perfectly explicit, as to our claim of
							right, and equally so in denying the right of Great-Britain to contest
							it— We attended this Evening a party at <persRef ref="thornton-william"

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date>27. VI:</date> It was past noon when I went to the Office, and
							shortly after, <persRef ref="eddy-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eddy</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from
							Rhode-Island called upon some business relating to the Office of
								<persRef ref="robbins-asher">U.S. District Attorney</persRef> in
							that State—while he was with me the Messenger of the Department
							announced M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning— I told the Messenger
							to say to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef> that I would receive him in a few
							minutes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eddy remained with me, not more
							than five minutes longer; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							when he came in, as he sat down took out his watch, and observed that it
							was forty minutes faster than the Clocks here— While he was speaking the
							Clock in the Office struck one— I made no answer to his remark, which
							might be considered either as a complaint that he had been made to wait,
							or as an apology for having come before the time appointed— He proceeded
							to say that conformably to the desire expressed by me yesterday he had
							now come to have some further conversation upon the subject of our
							interview then— There was in his manner an apparent effort of coolness,
							but no appearance of cheerfulness or good humour— I saw there was no
							real relaxation from the tone he had yesterday assumed, and felt that
							none would on my part be suitable. I said he would recollect that our
							conference of this day was not at my desire— I had yesterday repeatedly
							expressed to him the opinion that if this discussion was to be further
							pursued, it should be in writing— He had with some earnestness urged
							another conference—and when he requested me to fix the time, I had told
							him that I was ready and willing to hear then, any thing that he had to
							say on the subject— That perhaps under the excitement which he was then
							manifesting he might himself prefer to resume the conversation some
							other day, and if so, I would see him, whenever it should be most
							agreeable to himself— He had then asked me to name a time, and I had
							appointed this day, at one O’Clock— He said, “well then, be it so”— He
							then took from his pocket the National Intelligencer of yesterday,
							folded down to the column in which the proceedings of the House of
							Representatives were reported, and referring to the statement that
								<persRef ref="floyd-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Floyd</persRef> had reported a Bill for the occupation of Columbia
							River, said that was an indication of intentions in this Government
							which he presumed would leave no question of the propriety of his
							application to me— I told him it was precisely that in which its
							greatest impropriety consisted— But I could only repeat what I had said
							to him yesterday—that I saw no use in continuing a discussion upon the
							propriety of his conduct or of mine. He said that he would most
							cheerfully consent to be the sacrifice if that only was necessary to the
							harmony of the two Countries; but that nothing could exceed his
							astonishment at the manner in which I had received his application of
							yesterday. He could assure me with the utmost sincerity that since the
							existence of this Country as a Nation, there never had been a time when
							the British Government had been so anxiously desirous of preserving and
							cherishing the most perfect good-understanding and harmony with this—
							But that at the same time, they would not on that account yield one
							particle of their rights— I told him I had no doubt of the correctness
							of his statement in both its parts, and I was happy to give him the same
							assurance on the part of this Government— It was the earnest wish of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to preserve the most
							friendly relations with Great-Britain; but he would maintain all the
							rights of the United States— And I would add as my individual opinion
							that any chicaning of our right to the Mouth of Columbia river would
							assuredly not tend to promote that harmony between the two Countries—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning again repeated his surprize
							at the tone and temper with which his application yesterday had been
							received— He said he had examined and re-examined himself, and had in
							vain enquired what could have been the cause of the asperity with which
							he had been treated by me— Sir, said I, suppose M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush, should be <pb type="ms" n="502"/>present at a debate
							in the House of Commons, and should hear a member in the course of a
							Speech say something about the expediency of sending a Regiment of
							Troops to the Shetland Islands, or a new Colony, to New South-Wales—
							Suppose another member of Parliament should publish in a Newspaper a
							Letter, recommending the same project; and suppose <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							should then go to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, and formally alledge those two facts as his
							motives for demanding whether the British Government, had any such
							intentions? and if answered that very probably they might, he should
							assume an imperious and tragical tone of surprize, and talk about a
							violation of Treaties—how do you think it would be received?— He said
							that <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, he fully understood me, and could
							account for what had passed—this answer was perfectly explicit—but did I
							consider the cases as parallel?— So far as any question of right is
							concerned; said I, perfectly parallel— Have you, said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, any <hi rend="italic">Claim</hi>
							to the Shetland Islands, or New South Wales?— Have you any <hi
								rend="italic">Claim</hi>, said I, to the Mouth of Columbia river?—
							Why, do you not <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, replied he, that we have a
							claim?— I do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> said I, what you claim, nor
							what you do not claim— You claim India—you claim Africa—you
							claim—perhaps, said he a piece of the Moon— No; said I, I have not heard
							that you claim exclusively any part of the Moon; but there is not a spot
							on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> habitable globe, that I could affirm you
							do not claim—and there is none which you may not claim with as much
							colour of right, as you can have to Columbia river, or its Mouth— And
							how far, would you consider said he this exclusion of right to extend—to
							all the Shores of the South-Sea, said I—we know of no right that you
							have there— Suppose, said he, Great-Britain should undertake to make a
							settlement there, would you object to it? I have no doubt we should,
							said I— But surely, said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, proof
							was made at the negotiation of the Convention of October 1818 of the
							claims of Great-Britain, and their existence is recognized in it—
							[“]There was no proof, I said, made of any claim, nor to my knowledge,
							any discussion of claim— The boundary to the Stony-Mountains was
							defined— Westward of them, Great-Britain had no Settlement whatever— We
							had one at the Mouth of Columbia, which having been broken up during the
							War, was solemnly restored to us by the British Government, in
							fulfilment of a stipulation in the Treaty of Peace— We stipulated in the
							Convention that the Ports and Places on the pacific ocean, should be
							open to both parties for ten years, and taking all these transactions
							together we certainly did suppose that the British Government had come
							to the conclusion that there would be neither policy nor profit in
							cavilling with us about territory, on this North-American Continent”—
							[“]And in this, said he, you include our Northern Provinces on this
							Continent?” [“]No, said I; there the boundary is marked, and we have no
							disposition to encroach upon it— Keep what is your’s, but leave the rest
							of this Continent to us”— But said he this affects the rights of Russia
							and of Spain— [“]Russia and Spain I replied were the guardians of their
							own rights— Have you, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, any right
							to speak in their name?” “Why Sir, said he, I can assure you, that
							Great-Britain is in very close Alliance with them— Yes, Sir,
							Great-Britain has strong allies.”— “We know that very well, said I; but
							they have not authorized you to speak for them”— [“]And, do you wish me,
							said he, in a tone highly incensed, <hi rend="italic">to report to my
								Government</hi>, what you have now said to me.”— “Sir, said I, you
							may report to your Government; just what you please— Report to them, if
							you think proper every word that I have said to you, not only now, but
							at any time, or that I ever shall say; provided you report nothing but
							the truth; as I have no doubt you will[”]— He said he thanked me for the
							addition of that opinion— [“]I said that I had no doubt he would report
							nothing but the truth; and should not by anticipation admit any
							suspicion to the contrary— But, added I, if you do report our
							Conversation to your Government, I request you to state explicitly, that
							I took strong exception both to the form, and to the substance of your
							application to me on this occasion— To the form, because you came to put
								<pb type="ms" n="503"/>questions to me of an irritating nature, upon
							the foundation of the Speeches and Reports of individual members of
							Congress—and to the substance, because the questions were of a nature
							which we do not admit your right to ask— I did in the first instance
							answer an improper question; not in the name of the Government, but
							merely by giving you an opinion of my own— Upon which, the tone and
							manner assumed by you, in reply, convinced me that nothing useful to
							either party could result from any further verbal conference between us—
							If you meant to make a Falkland Island or Nootka Sound affair of it, I
							thought it best the discussion should be in writing, which would not be
							liable to misapprehension”— “I don’t know that said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, interrupting me”— [“]At least, (I
							resumed,) such misapprehensions would be more easily rectified, and
							would have over them, a guard of public opinion— The objection to the
							form of your address was the more serious, because you were the
							representative of a Nation, having itself a Legislature consisting of
							deliberative Assemblies tenacious of the perfect freedom of speech of
							their members, and the Government of which would certainly permit no
							foreign Minister to interrogate them upon the mere foundation of
							speeches made by members of Parliament in their places, or of
							publications made by them through the Press”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning then again denied that he had made the application,
							upon the sole ground of <persRef ref="nelson-hugh">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson’s</persRef> Speech, and
							reminded me that he had expressly told me, that he should not have
							noticed it, had it stood as a solitary fact— I replied that he had no
							right to mention it to me at-all as the foundation of debateable
							questions— But that my objection had reference, not alone to his notice
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson’s Speech— It was equally
							applicable to his mention of the publication of <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton</persRef>, and
							to his production this Morning of a newspaper, to point at a Report of a
							Committee of the House of Representatives to that body— He had alledged
								<hi rend="italic">no</hi> ground to me for his application on this
							subject, other than acts of individual Members of Congress on measures
							pending in the Legislature— What would be thought of an American
							Minister in England, who should presume to call upon the Secretary of
							State for foreign Affairs to account for speeches or writings of members
							and Committees of Parliament?— He said he was much mistaken if in the
							lately published correspondence respecting the Slave-trade there had not
							references by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, to speeches and
							proceedings in Parliament— Undoubtedly, said I, in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s despatches to his own
							Government—and we make no question of your right to report to your
							Government any thing said or done in Congress by any of its members— He
							said he believed, but would not positively assert that there had been in
							the Conferences or Correspondence between Lord Castlereagh and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush some reference to speeches in
							Parliament— I said, certainly none having the slightest analogy to that
							which I considered as exceptionable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							may have alluded to something said in Parliament by Lord Castlereagh
							himself;—But not directly, nor to question him concerning it— With
							regard to the substance of your application, I have seen the President
							since our yesterday’s interview, and now say, that not admitting your
							right to enquire into the intentions of this Government, with regard to
							an increase of our Settlement at the Mouth of Columbia river, I shall
							decline giving any answer to the enquiry—to which I add the renewed
							request that if you propose to pursue the discussion, you would for the
							future address me concerning it, in writing— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning then said he thought it hard to be denied an answer;
							and hoped if this was the determination of the American Government,
							instructions would be sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to
							give explanations, on the subject to Lord Castlereagh— This intimation
							appeared to me to be improper, but unwilling to multiply points of
							contention, and to prolong an irksome conversation, I made no reply to
							it— He then pressed indirectly, questions as to the extent of our claims
							on the Shores of the South Sea, till I said to him, “M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning, I have said, and repeated to you
							more than once, that I am not authorized, to answer the enquiries which
							you thought proper to make yesterday, and I have given you the reasons,
							why <pb type="ms" n="504"/>these answers were declined— After this I do
							not expect to be plied with captious questions, to obtain indirectly
							that which has been directly denied.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning at these words again became exceedingly irritated, complaining
							with great warmth of the term captious as applied to his questions— He
							said that whatever answer I might think proper to give to his questions,
							he thought I had no right to <hi rend="italic">qualify</hi> them, with
							epithets of censure— I recurred to expressions of his own, used in the
							course of these conversations; and particularly yesterday— He said he
							had used them <hi rend="italic">defensively</hi>; to which I replied
							that the only cause I was conscious of having given him for the
							excitement which he had manifested had been the request that he would
							address me on this subject, in writing—my motive for which had been that
							all further conversation between us concerning it, must tend to mutual
							irritation, and could not lead to a satisfactory Settlement— He said it
							was not so much the matter as the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> in which
							I had spoken which had hurt him— I said that he must consider both the
							matter and the manner as defensive on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> part;
							and then again reminded him of the exceptionable character which in my
							situation must attach to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> questioning by a
							foreign Minister, founded upon the speeches of members of Congress in
							their places, or upon proceedings pending in that body; and of my duty
							to repel at the first instant, and in the most decisive manner any such
							enquiry. I had therefore not only thought proper to demand written
							communications on this subject, but to shew by the manner of the demand
							that I had not been pleased by his reference to any words spoken or
							measures under discussion in Congress— My opinions and feelings on this
							incident remained unaltered, but I had no wish to extend the asperity of
							this difference beyond its immediate occasion. He had until now had the
							freest access to me at all times— I had always been ready either to
							converse with him in the unrestrained freedom of private life, or to
							confer with him as a public Minister—or to receive from him any written
							communication that he might have occasion to address to me— I wished
							notwithstanding what had now happened to continue with him in other
							respects on the same terms; and that on all other subjects he would
							consider himself on the same footing with me as if this had never
							occurred— He asked with a warmth which surprized me, how it was <hi
								rend="italic">possible</hi> that he should feel himself on the same
							terms with me as heretofore? He had immediately after his arrival here
							assured me that his own inclinations concurring with his instructions
							from his Government were to cultivate the most cordial harmony between
							our respective Nations— He had told me that on all occasions not
							involving the rights of his Country and the public duties of his station
							he should ever wish to shew me the deference due to more advanced
							years—that a few days since he had called at the Department and had said
							that he came to have, in familiar language, a <hi rend="italic"
								>gossiping</hi> Conversation with me— That when he called yesterday
							he had said, with allusion to that former conversation that he came as
							the British Minister, and it was with the intention of giving me notice
							that his call then was upon business; nothing could exceed his
							astonishment at the manner in which his application had been received
							yesterday—and how was it <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>, he repeated,
							that he should consider himself on the same terms with me as
							heretofore?— I here interrupted him and said—“M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning; I was observing that I wished you on all other
							subjects than this, to consider yourself upon the same terms with me as
							heretofore, and I now repeat to you the same overture, which was made by
							me, in the Spirit of conciliation— If you think it impossible . . .[”]
							he again, stopped me, and said that he would accept the proposal; upon
							which I told him I was well pleased that he should, as it relieved me
							from the necessity of replying to his remarks on my first making the
							proposal— They had been of a nature which I could otherwise not have
							forborne to notice— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning seemed
							apprehensive, that I was about nevertheless to tell him what my reply
							would have been, <pb type="ms" n="505"/>and <hi rend="italic"
								>intreated</hi> me to withhold it, which I accordingly did— I then
							repeated that after what had passed between us, I was confirmed in the
							opinion that it would be best to discuss hereafter <hi rend="italic"
								>this</hi> subject, if it was to be discussed at all, in writing— He
							said hesitatingly that he did not know that he should have any objection
							to write me a Note on the subject. I replied that I had yesterday felt
							myself the more called upon to insist on this, because he had advanced a
							pretension in which we never could acquiesce, and because it was not the
							first time it had been raised by a British Minister here— He asked with
							great apparent emotion who that Minister was?— I answered, <persRef
								ref="jackson-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>—“And you got rid of him”; said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning in a tone of violent passion—“and
							you got rid of him”—“and you got rid of him”—this repetition of the same
							words, always in the same tone, was with pauses of a few seconds,
							between each of them, as if for a reply— I said, [“]Sir, my reference to
							the pretension of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson was not”—here,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning interrupted me by saying—“If
							you think that by reference to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson, I
							am to be intimidated from the performance of my duty, you will find
							yourself greatly mistaken”— I had not, Sir, said I, the most distant
							intention of intimidating you from the performance of your duty—nor was
							it with the intention of alluding to any subsequent occurrences of his
							Mission; but—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning interrupted me again
							by saying, still in the tone of high exasperation—“let me tell you, Sir,
							that your reference to the case of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jackson is <hi rend="italic">exceedingly offensive</hi>”— “I do not
							know, said I, whether I shall be able to finish what I intended to say,
							under such continual interruptions”— He intimated by a bow that he would
							hear me. I was observing, said I, that in referring to the pretension of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson to take offence at a proposal
							to continue in writing a discussion commenced by oral conference, I had
							no intention of alluding to any subsequent transactions of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson or to their consequences— My
							allusion to it was solely because it was identically the same pretension
							advanced yesterday by you; and I now assigned it as the reason which had
							made it necessary for me to repel the demand in a manner more than
							usually pointed— Of the right of every Government to require from
							foreign Ministers, communications in writing, upon <hi rend="italic"
								>any</hi> subject of discussion with them, we cannot entertain a
							moment’s doubt, and it was but a few days since, that after a verbal
							conference between us on another subject, I had requested you to write
							me a note concerning it, which you did— In this case the very grounds
							upon which you avowed that you came to interrogate me, concerning the
							intentions of this Government; speeches and newspaper publications of
							individual members of Congress—the subject itself upon which I could not
							admit your right to interrogate me at-all; and the tragical tone with
							which you charged us with intending a violation of a Treaty, convinced
							me that the tendency of further conversation between us on this topic
							would only be to high irritation, and not to harmonious adjustment— I am
							still of the same opinion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning then
							recapitulated the assurances which he had, on his first arrival here,
							given me, and which he had since then more than once reiterated—of the
							friendly dispositions of his Government towards that of the United
							States— Of his own earnest desire to cultivate the harmony, and to
							smooth down all remnants of asperity between the two Countries— Of the
							respect which on all, occasions not involving a dereliction of his
							official duties he should always wish to shew <hi rend="italic"
								>personally</hi> to me— And of the deference which he should at all
							times pay to my <hi rend="italic">age</hi>. He concluded by adding—“But,
							I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> only have to say to you, Sir, that
							henceforth, whatever may happen, I shall never forget the respect due
							from me <hi rend="italic">to the American Government</hi>.” I made no
							reply, but bowed, to signify that I considered the conversation as
							closed and he withdrew— N.B. 5 [symbols] This narrative of two
							successive Conversations with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning is
							copied from a report of them which I committed to writing immediately
							after they occurred, my diary being then nearly three Months in arrear—
							On recurring to my diary of 24. 25. and 26. November 1817. I find that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot spoke to me twice of the
							despatching of the Ontario, and even on the last of those days wrote me
							a note concerning it, in which he not only asserted a claim on the part
							of Great-Britain to the Post at the <pb type="ms" n="506"/>Mouth of the
							Columbia river, but explicitly denied the obligation of Great-Britain by
							the Treaty of Ghent to restore that Post— This note was never answered,
							for very soon afterwards the British Government gave orders for the
							formal restoration of the Post, and it was restored with solemnity by
								<persRef ref="hickey-frederick">Captain Hickey</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prevost</persRef>—
							At the Negotiation of the Convention of October 1818. there was no
							discussion of British Claim; but they asserted it, as derived from the
							discoveries of <persRef ref="cook-james">Captain Cook</persRef>— By the
							Report of that Negotiation from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin</persRef>, and Rush it appears also that they supposed the
							British Government intended to bring up the discussion of the claim at a
							future period. The Article of the Convention is obviously a waiver of
							the discussion of the claim; for that time— But it will certainly come
							upon us again; for which I ought to be prepared— Let me remember it— My
							Sons <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> dined at <persRef

							I should make a written minute of what passed between us, and keep it
							for future occasion— With <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> I attended this
							Evening a numerous party at <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown’s</persRef> the Senator from
							Louisiana— This Gentleman has kept house here, both last year and the
							present, but was one of those members of the Senate who adhering to the
							rule of etiquette by which they exacted first visits at every Session
							from the Heads of the Executive Departments, declined all visiting
							intercourse with my family— There was a similar pretension of <persRef
								ref="brown-nancy">his Lady</persRef>— They declined invitations from
							us, and gave us none in return— The same rigour has continued until we
							received invitations to the party this Evening, which we accepted— At
							this Session of Congress the claim of a first visit has been waived by
							several of the Senators who heretofore insisted upon it, but is yet
							maintained by others— At M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown’s I heard
							of a very ardent debate in the House of Representatives upon the
							Missouri question, this day. I also met there M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Canning, who retained so much of the resentment with which
							he parted from me on Saturday, that there passed between us a bare
							salutation— The Columbia river project is so much the subject of
							conversation at this time, that it was touched upon this Evening by
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> one of the Editors of
							the National Intelligencer, in Canning’s hearing, Gales knowing nothing
							of what had passed between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning and
							me.— The publication on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> by
								<persRef ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eaton</persRef>, the Senator from Tennessee, was of a Letter from
								<persRef ref="robinson-william">W. D. Robinson</persRef><pb
								type="ms" n="507"/>to him; but <persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore
								Porter</persRef> claims it as a project first suggested by him, and
							in the National Intelligencer of this day, has published a Letter from
							him to <persRef ref="madison-james">President Madison</persRef>, written
							in 1815, which it is asserted had been seen by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson, before he wrote his memoir addressed to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton. There is an editorial remark in the
							paper of this day, that some Citizens question the policy of disclosing
							at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time our views upon the Western Shores of
							this Continent.— Canning will probably suspect that this remark comes
							from an official source, in consequence of his interviews with me—</p>

						<p><date>31. VII.</date> I received a Note from <persRef

								Thompson</persRef> Secretary of the Navy, pressing the departure of
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>, for whom the Sloop of
							War Ontario is waiting at Annapolis— He was accordingly despatched this
							day. I sent a Letter to <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef>, concerning the case
							of a man named <persRef ref="wilcocke-samuel">Wilcocke</persRef> from
							whom I have a letter written in prison at Montreal, complaining that he
							had been kidnapped at Burlington in the State of Vermont, and carried
							away into Canada, drafted also a despatch to <persRef key="rush-richard"
								>R. Rush</persRef>, enclosing the papers communicated recently to
							Congress relative to the negotiation for the suppression of the Slave
							trade, with some remarks; but I did not notice the two interviews in
							which the Columbia river Settlement formed the topic of discussion— For
							omitting this I had two reasons; one proceeding from the intimation by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning of the wish that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be
							instructed to give explanations to Lord Castlereagh on the subject— I
							thought the suggestion from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							himself unadvised, and nothing but a disposition to treat him with all
							possible moderation, and to make allowances for the inflammation of his
							temper prevented me from then resenting it— I did not even appear to
							notice it. But thinking it highly probable that in his Report to his
							Government, he has stated that he did express this wish, I am willing to
							see how <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>
							will broach the subject to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, and how
							he will proceed on discovering that Rush has no information of what has
							passed between Canning and me, and no Instruction to enable him to
							answer any question concerning our intentions— Rush’s caution will
							prevent him from saying any thing which he will not be authorized to
							say; but his candour will impel him immediately to declare that the
							subject has not even been mentioned in any of the communications of his
							Government to him— The extreme reluctance of Canning to any <hi
								rend="italic">written</hi> discussion of the subject is one of the
							many symptoms that the British Government have a wavering, unsteady
							system on this point— They are anxious to prevent our acquiring a firm
							footing on the shores of the South Sea, and yet they dare not take a
							fixed , unequivocal stand against it. <persRef ref="baker-anthony"
								>Baker’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi

							the alarm here upon <persRef ref="floyd-john">Floyd’s</persRef> Report
							and Bill, and at the same time his repugnance to discuss the subject in
							writing, all disclose a policy “willing to wound and yet afraid to
							strike.” My second reason for omitting to instruct Rush upon it is that
							this course will give us more time— Castlereagh can say nothing about
							it, with a retreat in reserve— Canning’s zeal and vehemence have indeed
							brought the temporizing system of his Government to an awkward stage— If

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The range of my rising hour through the month has been
							from IV:45 to VIII. and the average VI:35. The severity of the Season,
							the frequent evenings spent in company, at home and abroad, and the
							increased number of my own family have been the principal causes of this

							accordingly do immediately after making my own fire— He then rises;

							time— I am still occupied upon the Report on Weights and Measures, in
							examining the Statute Laws of the several States— The copies for the two
							houses not being yet completed. As I pursue this business chiefly at
							home; I seldom attend at my Office before Noon or one O’Clock, and
							almost always remain there until near six in the Evening. Then return
							home to dine, and when I pass the Evening at home usually employ it in
							reading the newspapers— I have written scarcely one line of Journal, the
							whole month— My diary stands at the first days of November.</p>
