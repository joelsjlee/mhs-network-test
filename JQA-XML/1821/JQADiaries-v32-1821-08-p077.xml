						<p><date>21. IV:30.</date> At six this morning I left the City of Washington
							in the Stage for Baltimore. There was already one passenger in the
							Carriage, and we took up several others at different places. We
							breakfasted at <persRef ref="kochendorfer-unknown"
								>Kochendorfers</persRef> at Bladensburg; but it was half past three
							in the afternoon when we reached the Indian Queen Hotel at Baltimore,
							now kept by <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum</persRef>. It was the
							heat of the weather which made us so late before we arrived— I dined
							there and immediately after embarked in the Steam-boat United States
								<persRef ref="trippe-edward">Captain Trippe</persRef> for
							Frenchtown, which place we reached soon after Midnight— I had no
							acquaintance on board the vessel, and in the midst of a crowd of
							fellow-passengers passed the day in solitude— From the moment that I set
							my foot on board the vessel, the summer heat under which I have been
							languishing nearly a month at Washington was gone. The weather clouded
							up, and a strong breeze of wind arose as cool as was to be desired. I
							betook myself in the evening to a birth.</p>

						<p><date>22.—</date> On landing about one O’Clock this morning at
							Frenchtown, the Passengers were packed in seven Stages, to Newcastle— I
							was in Number two with four women, five small children, and one other
							man— One of the women with two little girls were of the party from
							Washington. We rode sixteen miles to Newcastle where we arrived just
							after daylight, about half past four in the morning— We embarked
							immediately in the Steam-Boat Baltimore, <persRef ref="jenkins-abasha"
								>Captain Jenkins</persRef> and at eight in the morning landed at the
							wharf in Philadelphia. I left my baggage in the boat and called first
							upon <persRef ref="ewing-samuel">Samuel Ewing</persRef>— Then upon
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph Ingersoll</persRef> with whom
							I had some conversation concerning the action of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">Levett Harris</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="lewis-william">W. D. Lewis</persRef>, and the depositions which
							are to be taken of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>—
							After passing an hour with Ingersoll I returned to Ewing’s, and found at
							his house <persRef ref="peters-richard">R. Peters </persRef>who told me
							he had lately returned from Boston and had seen my <persRef
								ref="adams-john">father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
								>brother</persRef> at Quincy. Ewing went with me to <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant’s</persRef>. After a short visit
							there, I called at the Mansion House Hotel, and at <persRef
								ref="shinn-elizabeth">Miss Shinn’s</persRef>, and enquired if
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Connell</persRef> had been there to see me— He had been at Miss
							Shinn’s, and I immediately afterwards met him in the Street. It was now
							Noon and I embarked in the Steam-Boat Philadelphia, <persRef
								ref="jenkins-abasha">Captain A. Jenkins</persRef> for Trenton.
							Ewing accompanied me to the Boat, and Connell went with us in it as far
							as Burlington— <persRef ref="sergeant-unknown">Miss Sergeant</persRef>
							was also a passenger as far as Princeton— <persRef
								ref="chauncey-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chauncey</persRef> the lawyer, and a <persRef ref="hall-unknown6"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef>, a relation of
							Ewing’s came likewise to Burlington— The Boat successively stopped
							there, at Bristol, and at Bordentown. The river Delaware was so low that
							the Boat was obliged to stop, at a place which they said was two Miles,
							but which was nearer five short of Trenton— There the Stages took us up,
							and we rode first to Trenton then 11 Miles to Princeton, where Miss
							Sergeant left us, at her Sisters <persRef ref="miller-unknown5">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Millers</persRef>, and then sixteen
							Miles to New-Brunswick where we arrived between ten and eleven at Night—
							We lodge at <persRef ref="keyworth-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Keyworth’s</persRef> close to the wharf whence the
							Steam-boat departs. I retired immediately to bed.</p>

							something for <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>— I
							said I had a proposal to him from the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, but knew not whether it would suit him— On
							returning to the City Hotel I found by advertisements in the newspapers
							that the Steam-ship Robert Fulton, was to depart at five O’Clock this
							afternoon upon a trip to Newport and Providence, and I immediately
							determined to take passage in her, instead of waiting till to-morrow
							morning for the Steam-boat— I accordingly went down to the wharf and
							engaged my passage after going on board the ship and examining her
							accommodations. At three O’Clock I dined at the public table at the City
							Hotel— Called at <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Trumbull’s</persRef> and found him and <persRef

							tables were laid under an awning upon the deck, and we had a band of
							music who from time to time entertained us with enlivening airs— I
							nevertheless in the midst of this crowd passed the Evening in solitude
							and about ten O’Clock retired to my birth in one of the State-Rooms.</p>

							and absurd fancies— He is said to have a Swedénborgian crack in his
							brain. On the whole the performances, both with reference to classic
							learning and to ornamental exhibition, were the most indifferent that I
							ever witnessed on such an occasion. I dined in the Hall— Of my own

						<p><date>30. V:30.</date><persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston</persRef> called for me at 8,
							according to his engagement— <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef> was with him. We
							went immediately to <persRef ref="kirkland-john">President
								Kirkland’s</persRef> house at Cambridge— The speaking, for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s prizes commenced at half past
							nine. I attended as one of the judges, being made permanently one of
							them, by the founder. The names of the competitors were given to us, by
							President Kirkland, with a note of the piece selected by each of them
							for declamation— There were twelve of the Junior, and seven of the
							Senior Class, who had entered their names for speaking. No graduates of
							the year. By the foundation, the competition is limited to those three
							Classes. There was no settled mode among the judges of marking the
							comparative merit of the performers; but I adopted that recommended by
							President Kirkland of marking the name of each speaker immediately after
							he finished, from 1 to 4. in figures, affixing the highest number to the
							best, and graduating downwards according to merit. The judges set in the
							front galleries in the Meeting house, with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Boylston the founder in the centre— The junior Class
							Candidates spoke first, and after them the Seniors. The performances
							lasted about two hours after which the judges returned to President
							Kirkland’s study. The <pb type="ms" n="81"/>votes for assigning the
							prizes, were taken by ballot; but there was a want of regulation as to
							the mode of taking them; and much diversity of opinion with regard to
							the relative merit of the Speakers. The judges were President Kirkland,
								<persRef ref="porter-eliphalet">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Porter</persRef> of Roxbury, <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge
								Davis</persRef>, <persRef ref="parker-isaac">Chief Justice
								Parker</persRef>, <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Lowell</persRef>, <persRef ref="pickering-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pickering</persRef> and

								Ware</persRef>, son of the <persRef ref="ware-henry"
								>Professor</persRef>—<persRef ref="phillips-john">John
								Phillips</persRef>, and myself— I found from the balloting that the
							persons most defective in their own elocution, differed most from the
							majority in their opinions. There were two first prizes of 15 dollars
							each, and three second prizes of 10 dollars. They were all at last
							allotted as I should have given them, with the exception of one first
							and one second prize, which I should have substituted for each other— My
							son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> was among the unsuccessful
							candidates. He spoke with propriety, and without sufficient force and
							animation— The pieces were all sufficiently committed to memory; but few
							of them were well chosen— There was no poetry, and no dialogue.
							Altogether the speaking was poor, for want of elementary instruction in
							the art of declamation— We had but scanty time for the assignment of the
							prizes and at twelve went again to the Meeting House, and heard the ΦBK
							exercises—an Oration by <persRef ref="gray-john">John C. Gray</persRef>,
							and a poem in the Spenserian Stanza, Byronized, by a <persRef
								ref="bryant-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bryant</persRef>— Gray’s Oration was well written and well delivered—
							The Poem was poetical in the thoughts and prosaic in the language—
							Poetry without numbers, and rhyme without harmony. We dined with a party
							of more than twenty at President Kirkland’s— <persRef ref="farrar-john"
								>Professor Farrar</persRef> lives with him in the house, and his
							family, the President being a bachelor. After dinner, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston and <persRef
								ref="cogswell-joseph">professor Cogswell</persRef> I visited the
							University library and medical school. Saw the <persRef
								ref="ebeling-christoph">Ebeling</persRef> library, a present from
								<persRef ref="thorndike-israel">I. Thorndike</persRef>, a beautiful
							manuscript copy of the aphorisms of <persRef ref="hippocrates"
								>Hippocrates</persRef>, presented by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Boylston, and the anatomical preparations given by <persRef
								ref="nicholls-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.
								Nicholls</persRef>. I then returned to Boston with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Boylston taking with us my Son John— I
							promised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston to visit him at
							Princeton the week after next, and to allot the whole week to the visit.
