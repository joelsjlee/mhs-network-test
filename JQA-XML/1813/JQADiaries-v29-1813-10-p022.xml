							gave me some particulars concerning the French Prisoners in this Country
							and their treatment, which differs much in the different Governments. He
							says that of all the prisoners made in the year 1812. there are not
							25000 now remaining alive— The treatment of them is the worst in the

							Sunday after Trinity. Received a note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> asking me to call
							upon him at half past twelve O’Clock, at Noon, which I did— He said he
							had received yesterday a number of letters from the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and among the rest some
							concerning our affairs— In one of them he was ordered to receive from
							us, and forward to the Emperor our Credential Letter, as he the Count
								<pb n="24" type="ms"/>had suggested, so that we might be completely
							recognized, and the mission fully received as a foreign Legation at this
							Court— That he had written to us to ask for the Credential Letter, and
							he left it entirely at our option, to enclose it under a cover to him;
							or to deliver it to him in person; if we preferred the latter mode we
							should only have to mention it in a Note, as he should in that case
							receive us formally in his apartments of Ceremony— That with regard to
							our being presented to the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna;elizabeth-alexeievna">Empresses</persRef>, we
							need give ourselves no trouble— He would consider the application as
							made, and would take the directions of the Empresses as to the time.
							That the reigning Empress would probably give us our Audience next
							Sunday; unless in the interval there should be a Te Deum— In that case
							he would endeavour to procure us the Audience prior to it, that my
							Colleagues might have the opportunity to attend it—and he requested me
							to ask <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> to send him the names of the persons attached to
							the Legation who wished to be presented to the Empresses. He observed
							that he had addressed the letter in which he asked us for our credential
							letter, generally to the Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers
							Plenipotentiary of the United States, without naming us, because he had
							not known which of us to name first— That in the Credential he observed
							I was first named; and that <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s</persRef> name was first in
							the Full-power to treat with England— I told him that it had resulted
							from a delicacy of attention in the <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President</persRef> towards me.— That in the power to treat with
							England M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s name was first; to
							which I could have no possible objection. He having held many years an
							office of higher rank than any one in which I had been placed— But the
							President had perhaps thought as I had already been here sometime, it
							would be in some sort displacing me, to give precedence to another
							Plenipotentiary before me at the Emperor’s Court, and in the Credential
							letter had therefore put my name first. It was however a point on which
							I had no feeling to gratify, and I should be obliged to him if he would
							always consider M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin as the first of
							the three Plenipotentiaries— He asked me if he should send his
							communications to the mission, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							as the Secretary of the Mission, or continue to send them to me— I said
							either way, or to the other Plenipotentiaries— They would always be
							received with equal pleasure, to whomsoever they might come— But he
							might observe from this expedient that little punctilios of precedence
							were apt to arise in Republics as well as under other forms of
							Government. He said that the thought that Republics might naturally be
							liable to such questions <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than other
							Governments; which remark was very just— Because in other Governments
							such questions for the most part are <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>— In
							Republics they are always open.— The Count asked me, if I would take the
							letter myself which I did.— He also shewed me one of the Emperor’s
							letters to him— It was a note of four lines in the Emperor’s own
							hand-writing without direction or signature, dated Töplitz 8 September
							(O.S.) Its purport was thus— “J’approuve complettement Monsieur le
							Comte, vôtre lettre au <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Comte de
								Lieven</persRef> sur les Affaires d’Amerique; et je vous prie de
							pour suivre cette affaire de même— Tout a Vous.” This was the whole
							letter, and the first and last words precisely as I give them; of the
							others I only recollect the substance. He said that in another of the
							Letters the Emperor had directed him to apologize to us for the delay of
							his Answer; which was owing solely to his having been constantly on
							horseback, and in presence of the Enemy, for several weeks.— He had also
							sent him orders to furnish <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron
								Blome</persRef> with a ship to go home in, and to take with him the
							effects belonging to the legation—the Count gave me the two collections
							of the intercepted letters from the french army, taken with the army.—
							Mails of 12 and 16 September— One of these letters he told me was from
							the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef> and one
							from the <persRef ref="berthier-louis">Prince de Neufchatel</persRef>.
							The Courier who brought these dispatches left Töplitz 25 September N.S.
							the Emperor’s letter to the Empress mother was of the day before— The
							Emperor expected immediately afterwards the arrival of <persRef
								ref="benningsen-levin">General Bennigsen</persRef> with his army to
							join them; and then the main army was to march forward. The Emperor
							expected great Events from day to day. <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Napoleon</persRef> had attempted several times, and on various
							quarters to penetrate into Bohemia, but had every where been repulsed—
								<persRef ref="alopeus-maximilian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alopeus</persRef> had written to him the Count, that Napoleon’s
							marches and countermarches and the extraordinary circumspection of his
							present movements had considerably affected his military reputation— But
							the Count added, that he did not join in that opinion— He thought his
							circumspection a new proof of his ability.— For my part I believe the
							man is abandoned of God, and that Heaven is breaking one of the
							instruments of his wrath. The only prayer I dare to form is that by his
							ruin, still more terrible scourges may not be substituted in his place.—
							I took the Count’s letter immediately to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin and <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bayard</persRef>— We all concurred in the opinion that we should ask
							an Audience of the Count, and deliver to him the Credential letter in
							form.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard said this was something;
							but he had much rather have received the answer from England— He thought
							our Audience of Introduction to the Empresses, might at the same time be
							an Audience to take leave— I wrote the Note to Count Romanzoff asking
							him to appoint a time for us to deliver the Credential <pb n="25"
								type="ms"/>credential to him; and I sent it in the Evening to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin; to be copied, if approved by
							him, and sent to-morrow morning to the Count by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harris— I also paid a long visit to <persRef
								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef>, and took back to him
								<persRef ref="paley-william">Paley’s</persRef> Evidences, and
							natural Theology which he had lent me— I had a long and interesting
							conversation with him, in which I put him to sleep only once— He was
							lamenting the ruin and desolation of Saxony— I said I thought Prussia
							must also deserve some share of commiseration; but he said the cases
							were entirely indifferent— People that were ruined in a good cause did
							not feel it at-all like those who were ruined in a bad one.— M<hi

							advertised in the Papers; the rule I had always observed on this subject
							and its motives.— <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Montreal</persRef> paid me a morning visit— He told me
							that <persRef ref="rapatel-jean">Colonel Rapatel</persRef> had arrived,
							with the body of <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General Moreau</persRef>,
							which is to be buried from the Catholic Church— Rapatel has told all the
							Circumstances of Moreau’s death— He was reconnoitreing with the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> before Dresden, 27 August— The
							fourth Cannon-Ball that was fired struck him; killed his horse; crushed
							both his legs; killed another horse, under an officer standing by him,
							and passed under the Emperor Alexander’s horse’s head— Moreau fell with
							his horse—instantly raised himself upon his two hands, and said “je suis
							perdu”— Rapatel had sprung from his horse, and raised Moreau, by holding
							him up under the arms; at the same time endeavouring to cheer and
							comfort him with hopes— After a few minutes he said “que ce Coquin de
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef> est
							heureux.”!— He was placed upon a litter, and soon after asked Rapatel to
							feel into his side pocket where he would find a flint and steel and some
							Sigarrs— He struck the fire and lighted a Sigarr; from which time he
							never manifested a sign of complaint— The legs were amputated the same
							day— He was removed on the litter to Toplitz, where he died the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d:</hi> of September.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Montreal says also that a Treaty of subsidy has been signed
							at the Emperor’s Head Quarters with England; for two Millions
							Sterling—one in specie and one in warlike Stores— Six Millions of Rubles

							about <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wolcott’s</persRef> Commission to procure him some seeds of plants.
							He sent me a Bill for £100. Sterling, supposing it would be more than
							sufficient to pay for his whole list, and all the charges— I gave the
							list to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer requesting him to inform
							me, where they could be procured— But he found they were not to be had
							here, and wrote his friends at Moscow; they immediately procured them
							almost all, and are sending them on here by land.— But there was one
							Article which cost more than double the amount of the Bill, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott thought would pay for the whole—
							He had written for 25 lbs of Cauliflower seed— But it costs 150 Rubles a
							pound. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer’s friends purchased only
							eighteen pounds, and they come to 2700 Rubles— The other Articles will
							not much exceed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott’s expectations—
							But as this would run up far beyond his calculation, I desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer to send back the Cauliflower,
							reserving only two or three pounds, and to make an allowance to the
							seller, if necessary for taking it back— I shall be not a little
							perplexed how to send the other articles unless they should arrive
							before <persRef ref="jones-lloyd">Captain Jones</persRef> sails. At Noon
							according to appointment I called upon <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef

							there should be a Te Deum, we might be presented to her before it, that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard may have the opportunity to attend it; and he should
							rejoyce in having so happy an occasion for our presentation— I consider

								ref="naryshkin-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Narishkin
								the Grand-Master</persRef> of the Ceremonies, to take the orders of
							the Empresses on the subject— The reigning Empress went yesterday to

							Gatschina where she would stay untill to-morrow Night. the Empress
							Mother would stay untill the 14/26. her birth day at Gatschina— That day
							she would come to Pavlofsk where the reigning Empress and the Imperial
							family would dine with her— She would stay there untill the 17/29 when
							she would come to the City for the Winter. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard asked the Count whether <persRef
								ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> was coming here— He
							said the letters from Vienna mentioned that Lord Walpole was there, and
							coming here— As the <persRef ref="francis-i">Emperor Francis</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="metternick-klemons">Count Metternich</persRef>, his
							Minister of foreign Affairs were both absent from Vienna, he did not
							know why Lord Walpole had chosen precisely that moment to go there,
							unless it was, that having to arrange the matter of a subsidy, his
							business might be with the <persRef ref="wallis-joseph">Minister of the
								finances at Vienna</persRef>— <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord
								Aberdeen</persRef> had presented his Credentials to the Emperor of
							Austria, as British Ambassador. He had been commissioned and dispatched
							from England before the end of the Armistice, upon the confidential
							communications of Russia to the British Government; of the dispositions
							of Austria to change her system. And he had arrived at the
							head-quarters, and found all prepared for his reception, as had been
							anticipated. It was now said upon very good authority that the <persRef
								ref="maximilian-i">king of Bavaria</persRef>, had detached himself
							from his alliance with France, and made an arrangement with Austria— He
							had no official account of this himself; but it was reported on
							authority which deserved full credit— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin asked whether in any arrangement which might be negotiated
							between Austria and Bavaria, the Tyrol would not come in for something—
							The Count answered, that the Tyrol was in a state of insurrection. That
								<persRef ref="stackelberg-gustav">Count Stackelberg</persRef> had
							written him so from Vienna, and that they had refused a passage to the
							French troops.— He then asked us if we had ever seen any Tyrolians— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he had once seen one— The
							Count said he had seen numbers of them on his Mission in Germany, and
							afterwards by the Emperor’s orders he had been in relations with their
							deputies— They were a very singular people—a loyal, brave, honourable
							people; but their coquetterie consisted in opposition— He had asked them
							what Sovereign they themselves would prefer—they said, the house of
							Austria—but upon Condition they should be better treated than they had
							been— They were willing to try the house of Austria again; and if upon
							trial they should not be satisfied they would look out elsewhere.— From
							the Count’s I went to call upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Narishkin

								<persRef ref="rapatel-jean">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>

							the Emperor has now appointed one of his Aids.— The Church service was

							The Music was the same that had been composed for the funeral of the
							late <persRef ref="stanislawiiaugust">King of Poland</persRef>. The
							singing was very good.— The Sermon was preached in French, by <persRef
								ref="u">father Rosavel</persRef>, Professor of Philosophy at the
							Jesuit’s College. His text was from the Wisdom of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, Ch. 9. v. 13. “For what man is he that can know
							the Counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?” It
							was delivered from Memory—short—not exceeding fifteen Minutes—
							Remarkable for moderation in the Sentiments, and without one word of
							invective against <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef>,
							or even of allusion to him— The biographical sketch of Moreau’s history
							was such as might be collected from the Gazettes— His Military exploits
							sufficiently and not too much detailed— His famous Retreat particularly
							dwelt upon— His refusal to execute the decrees of the Convention against
							the Emigrants, and for giving no Quarter to the English and Hanoverians,
							justly alledged as instances of the humanity and magnanimity of his
							character— His equivocal transactions with <persRef
								ref="pichegru-charles">Pichegru</persRef>, at two different periods,
							and his accusation of Pichegru at one of them slurr’d over as points too
							thorny to be discussed.—His trial was only mentioned to say that it cost
							him the greatest part of his fortune— The Panegyric of the Emperor
							Alexander was well interwoven with that of the General, and his medal
							for the year 1812 adduced as a proof of his modesty and Piety— The style
							of the discourse was altogether temperate, with scarcely one oratorical
							movement, excepting an Apostrophe to the inhabitants of Augsburg, which
							was not very well placed— In truth the whole Ceremony was languid—
							Excepting Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Rapatel, there was not
							perhaps a real mourner in the Church.— He appeared to be much affected;
							and lamented to me that the Ball had not struck him instead of his
							General.— The Ministers and Generals of the Country were there; but none
							of the foreign Ministers excepting <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count
								Maistre</persRef>—the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier
								Bardaxi</persRef> was said to be ill.— The Catafalque was elegant,
							but plain; without ornaments or trophies. The Church was partly hung in
							black— The body was deposited in a vault at the right hand of the
							central aisle of the Church— There were troops drawn up in front of the
							Church, who fired several vollies of musketry at the moment of
							interment— The whole Ceremony was about three hours long. It had begun

							letters were from my family and friends at Quincy and Boston; but none
							later than 19. July— There was a packet for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin, containing family letters and newspapers, but not
							of a later date— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer enclosed to

							mentions that the Senate of the United States had negatived the
							appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to the

								>r</hi> Gallatin— I found they had not risen from table— <persRef
								ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis</persRef> was
							there, and I found had received a letter from Gothenburg— Soon after I
							came, he went out with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard to his

							but <persRef ref="milligan-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Milligan</persRef>, soon after took him out of the Room, to his

							Gallatin who appeared uneasy and under some agitation— M<hi

							nomination of <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Russell</persRef> as Minister to Sweden had been
							negatived by the Senate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin,
							expressed an apprehension that the whole Mission Extraordinary had been
							also negatived; for which he said there were the same motives as for
							rejecting the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— He
							asked me if I had no other letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fosdick, than the two addressed to the Mission, which I had delivered to

							delicacy to tell him what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer had
							written me— I therefore came home to avoid being further pressed with
							questions, which might <pb n="29" type="ms"/>have made it necessary for
							me to tell him, what he ought to hear from any other person sooner than
							from me.— While I was out the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier

							April— But their full Moon, by the Julian Calendar was Monday 19 April,

								Appleton</persRef> came to inform me that he intends going to-morrow

								Todd</persRef> came in, with further reports, contained in English

									>r</hi> Speyer</persRef> last Monday; but as it rested upon very
							remote and indirect authority, and there was then no other account of it

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>, and accompanied

							Dukes <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Nicholas</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="michael2">Michaël</persRef>, and lastly to the <persRef
								ref="annafeodorovna">Grand Duchess Ann</persRef>— There had been
							some question whether according to the Etiquette we should be presented
							in mourning—to solve which, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris had
							written to the <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Master of the Ceremonies</persRef>, and had received for
							answer from <persRef ref="svistunov-nikolai">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Swistounoff</persRef> that we should— We accordingly
							wore crapes round the arm, at the sword-hilt, and in the hat. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Swistounoff also mentioned as points of
							etiquette the three bows on advancing to the presence of the imperial
							personages, and the three on retiring from it, with the precaution of
							stepping backwards without turning round— The Empress Mother however on
							our entering her apartment immediately advanced towards us, and scarcely
							gave time for the three bows— She expressed very courteously her
							satisfaction at my new appointment, and her hope that it would prolong
							my stay at <persRef ref="alexander-i">her Son’s</persRef> Court; and she
							was equally polite in her addresses to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard— Spoke of America, of
							the long voyage, of this City, the river, the Climate &amp;c— On her
							enquiring whether my Colleagues had visited the places in the vicinity
							of the City, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin mentioned that they
							had seen with great admiration the beneficent Institutions under her
							patronage— This was a favourite topic for her, and she conversed upon
							it, several minutes. She said that she did not approve the principle of
							the foundling hospitals, because she thought it was encouraging
							immorality; but as they had been instituted by the <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>, it was just to
							respect her intentions, and carry them as far as possible into effect.
							The late <persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor</persRef> had always had it much
							at heart, and her Son had never ceased to take great interest in it. She
							mentioned it as a great evidence of the morality of the Russian People,
							that when in consequence of the last years disasters, when the Enemy
							penetrated to the very capital of the Empire, and the <pb n="32"
								type="ms"/>children under the care of these Institutions had been
							dispersed all over the Country, yet the people into whose hands they had
							fallen had generally taken so good care of them, that out of seven
							thousand, to which their numbers amounted there were only eighteen of
							whom there was yet no account what had become of them— And the mortality
							among the rest had scarcely been greater than in ordinary years.— She
							spoke also of our benevolent Institutions in America; and particularly
							those relating to the management of Prisons— She had read with great
							pleasure the accounts of them, and she admired the idea of aiming at the
							reformation rather than the punishment of offenders— She said she had
							heard there was a great similarity between the Russian and the American
							People for which reason she rejoyced the more in the good qualities of
							her Countrymen— The Grand-Dukes, and the Grand-Duchess Ann, spoke only
							of the common topics of weather, climate, the City and the Country— Our
							Audiences, were all over and I returned home in the space of an hour.— I
							read prayers for the 20<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Sunday after Trinity.— Walking before dinner
							I met <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Appleton</persRef>, on the Quay— He goes to-morrow Morning— I had sent a
							packet of letters for America to his lodgings— He told me he had
							received from <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis</persRef> a further account of the Action upon Lake Ontario—
							It is less favourable then the first account I had from <persRef
								ref="speyer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speyer</persRef>.—
							In the evening I read <persRef ref="goguet-antony">Goguet</persRef>.</p>

							temptations to stray from one study to another. My health, and of course
							my capacity of application has been better this month than the last— Yet
