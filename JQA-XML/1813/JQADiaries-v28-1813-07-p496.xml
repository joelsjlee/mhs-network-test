							sent <persRef ref="ouvre-pierre">Pierre</persRef> immediately to tell
							him how sincerely I felt for his situation, and to enquire if I could do

							could not receive him without a permission from the <persRef
								ref="gorgoli-ivan">Master of the Police</persRef>; and he desired me
							to endeavour to obtain it for him. I went to see Quinzard myself and
							found him in bed and unable to rise from it, not apparently so near his
							end as Louis had thought, but having probably not many days to live— His
							disease is a pulmonary consumption. He told me that Lord Cathcart’s
							Maitre d’Hotel named Bertrand had absolutely besieged him for four
							Months together to draw him away from my service, and now he totally
							neglected him—would not suffer his friends to come to attend and nurse
							him; nor even supply him with what he needed in his condition. He was
							very anxious to be removed, and to take with him his trunk which was in
								<persRef ref="u">Bertrand’s</persRef> possession, and contained four
							thousand Rubles in paper and some gold— I went to Fournier’s and
							ascertained that he was willing and desirous to receive Quinzard if the
							permission could be obtained. I then called at the House of General
							Gorgoly the Grand-Master of Police, but he was not at home— I returned
							and wrote him a Note requesting the permission for Quinzard’s removal,
							which I sent to Fournier to carry to him— I also called this morning on

						<p><date>8. </date>The <persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">father General of

							for <persRef ref="grassi-john">father Grassi</persRef>, President of the
							College at Georgetown, District of Columbia, and also 110 ducats, to
							make a remittance of 55 pounds Sterling for the value of which I am to

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beverley</persRef> sent me a note,
							apologizing for not being able to see me at eleven O’Clock as he had
							appointed, he being obliged very suddenly to go to Cronstadt. I wrote
							him an answer, stating that what I wanted was the certificate required
							by the Police for the removal of <persRef ref="quinzard-unknown"
								>Quinzard</persRef>— I went soon after again to see Quinzard, whom I
							found worse than he was yesterday, bitterly complaining that he was
							totally neglected, and could obtain neither attendance nor any thing
							that he wanted, and fearful that he should die leaving all his effects
							in <persRef ref="u">Bertrand’s</persRef> hands. He was particularly and
							excessively anxious about a paper in the nature of a Will, which
							Bertrand had prevailed upon him about three weeks ago to sign.— I had
							been with him about half an hour when D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Beverley came in, bringing the certificate that I had requested, with
							him, and making now another apology for not having gone to Cronstadt as
							he had expected— He then gave me some account of Quinzard’s illness, and
							of his motives in concert with Bertrand, for putting Quinzard’s trunk
							with his money and effects into Bertrand’s possession—as also, for
							preventing <persRef ref="u">Fournier</persRef>, from having access to
							him— They were afraid that if he went to Fournier’s house, he would soon
							die there— Fournier would remain in possession of the money, and
								<persRef ref="quinzard-marc">Quinzard’s brother</persRef> to whom he
							meant to leave it would never see any of it— The Doctor hinted at the
							same time that Bertrand had doubts whether he could allow Quinzard any
							wages, since he had been at <persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord
								Cathcart’s</persRef>, and whether his, Beverley’s attendance should
							go to the account of the house or was to be charged to himself— He said
							that he had a yearly salary for his attendance at the house, and that at
							any rate he was willing to attend him gratuitously, even after his
							removal; and from motives of humanity— He also offered if I wished it to
							meet <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Galloway</persRef>
							and consult with him on the case— These were points on which I could not
							interfere, but I told Beverley my opinion that Quinzard must in equity
							be entitled to his wages, and that his attendance was of course
							chargeable to the house— The Certificate was the essential object— As
							soon as Quinzard was sure of having it, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Beverley was gone he sent for Bertrand and asked for his
							trunk which was immediately brought—he had it opened, and the paper
							intended for a Will taken out— He struck out with his own hand all the
							legacies he had given— I advised him to make a regular and formal Will
							which he determined to do, and in the mean time to send his trunk to my
							house— I found the four thousand Rubles in paper, twelve Ducats, his
							watch; several pieces of silver, and his Cloathes in the trunk. It was
							afterwards sent to my house— He was in the afternoon removed to
							Fournier’s house; being carried in his bed.— Beverley told me he could
							live but a few days— While I was with him the <persRef
								ref="depenguilli-alexander">Abbé Penguilli</persRef> came in to see
							him, and an acquaintance of his named <persRef ref="u">Vedel</persRef>,
							both of whom advised him as well as I, to make a Will, and he sent for a
							sheet of stamped paper.— But he did not know whom to make his Executor,
							knowing no body in whom he could have sufficient Confidence.— I told him
							I would offer to be his Executor myself; but should perhaps very soon
							leave this Country, in which case he would have to substitute another.—
							He said he would ask the advice of the vieux prêtre (Penguilli) and make
							the Will to-morrow.— He told Bertrand that he owed him something for
							Oranges—and would pay him— Bertrand said it was best to defer it for
							when his account should be settled— He had left and yet intends to leave
							3300 Rubles to his brother, Marc Quinzard who lives at Varédes a village
							near Meaux in Brie— He had another brother named <persRef
								ref="quinzard-francois">François</persRef>; but he went away many
							years ago to the army, and he knows not what has become of him.—

									>r</hi> Treadwell</persRef>, called upon me this morning— He had
							a quantity of Cotton of the value he says of 100000 Rubles, in the hands
							of a merchant at Moscow named <persRef ref="u">Müller</persRef>— It was
							all burnt, at the Conflagration of Moscow, when the French took that
							City. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Treadwell came to ask my advice and
							opinion, whether he could not claim indemnity of the Russian Government,
							or of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Müller—and whether Müller could
							recover of him about 10,000 Rubles which he had advanced him upon the
							deposit of the goods— I told him I thought his chance of recovering
							indemnity either from the Russian Government or from Müller very <pb
								n="499" type="ms"/>small—that the Government was distributing some
							relief to the sufferers at Moscow and elsewhere, and that for a portion
							of that relief he might have a good claim— But that the losses were so
							great and extensive that the Government could not indemnify for them,
							and that they could probably not allow any stronger claim to the losses
							of foreigners than to those of their own people— Whether Muller was
							responsible to him for the worth of the Cotton destroyed, or he to
							Müller for the money advanced, were questions to be settled by the Laws
							of the Country, if they could not compromise them amicably, which he
							said was his desire— By the American Laws, and I supposed by those of
							this Country, Müller could not be accountable for property destroyed by
							a great and general Calamity without any fault on his part—whether he
							could recover monies advanced upon the pledge of that property, I could
							not positively say— It might depend upon the circumstances of the
							pledge, or the nature of the advances.— He said he had little
							expectation of recovering any thing, and would be glad to compromise for
							paying part of the money.— I went to see <persRef ref="quinzard-unknown"
								>Quinzard</persRef> at <persRef ref="u">Fournier’s</persRef> house—
							He was apparently not worse than yesterday and was much easier in mind—
							He has now a Doctor, and nursing entirely to his own satisfaction— The
							Doctor told him that if he had continued to take <persRef ref="u"
								>Beverley’s</persRef> prescriptions he would not have lived eight
							days longer— He has not made his Will— I told him that if he chose he
							might name me as his Executor, and if I should go away, he might
							substitute another person in my place— I would undertake to remit the
							money to his brother— But I advised him to let me write immediately to
								<persRef ref="quinzard-marc">his brother</persRef>, so that he might
							have the prospect of hearing from him, and knowing that he was alive, as
							well as how and to whom the remittance for him could be made— I made
							these suggestions to him to reflect upon, and promised to call and see
							him again to-morrow— I also advised him to send and ask <persRef ref="u"
								>Bertrand</persRef> for an immediate settlement of Accounts—
							Fournier came to my house, and took his linen from his trunk to carry to

									>r</hi> Fournier</persRef> came for some of <persRef
								ref="quinzard-unknown">Quinzard’s</persRef> linen which I gave him;
							and told me that he had been excessively ill in the Night;—so that he
							had thought he would not live through it— He also brought me his Will,
							which he made last Evening; and in which he has made me his Executor to
							remit the 3300 Rubles to his brother <persRef ref="quinzard-marc">Mark
								Quinzard</persRef>, and to pay the other legacies, and defray the
							Expences of his funeral— He left his Watch to my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— I went to see him about
							three O’Clock this afternoon— He complained of an excessive difficulty
							of breathing, and his speech was not perfectly distinct— There was a
							rattling in his throat which I also considered as a symptom of his
							approaching end; but his eyes were as clear as I ever saw them, and he
							appeared to be in full and perfect possession of his Understanding— I
							told him that I had received from Fournier his Will, and should there be
							occasion for it, would execute it to the best of my power— That with
							regard to the donation to my Son, which I sincerely hoped would not take
							effect, yet if it should, I accepted it for him with thanks— He
							expressed himself with warm gratitude for the kindness— I asked him if
							he wanted any thing further to send for it to my house— He said he was
							now in want of nothing; that every possible attention was paid to him,
							and if he had been treated so from the beginning of his illness he was
							sure he should now be well— He said there were a pair of earrings and
							two wedding rings in his trunk that did not belong to him— They belonged
							to a taylor who had pledged them to him for a loan of money— But he had
							since made him some waistcoats, and he wished me to send the trinkets to
							him, by <persRef ref="ouvre-pierre">Pierre</persRef>, who knew where he
							lived. He told me he had sent to <persRef ref="u">Bertrand</persRef> to
							ask for a settlement of accounts; that Bertrand had been to him, but had
							evaded and deferred complying with his request— On returning home I
							found the rings and earrings in the trunk, and gave them to Pierre to
							carry to their owner. This afternoon the weather being fine, <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Adams</persRef> proposed to take a row-boat, and make a little party
							upon the river— We went, with <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef> and Charles immediately after dinner. We took the
							boat at the Palace Corner, and being in it concluded to go to <persRef
								ref="krehmer-sebastian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Krehmer’s</persRef> at Ochta— We reached there between 8 and 9 in
							the Evening and took tea there— <persRef ref="mara-gertrud">Madam
								Mara</persRef> once celebrated as a singer, and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Florio</persRef> were there—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krehmer came home soon after, with
								<persRef ref="u">Miss Bock</persRef>.— The Ladies had music— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mara’s voice is yet fine though she is
							near seventy years of age. We came home rapidly, with the wind and
							current in our favour— It was near twelve at Night when we landed.
							Pierre told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fournier had been
							here to say that Quinzard died at a quarter past seven O’Clock this
							Evening.</p>

								<persRef ref="quinzard-unknown">Quinzard’s</persRef> trunk; and to
							read over the Papers, which consisted altogether of Certificates,
							Passports, and a few letters from his family and two or three friends—

							been in the service of the <persRef ref="louisphilippejoseph">Duke of

							and here— His Certificates from the <persRef ref="u">Chevalier de

								<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef>, <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Merry</persRef>, and others are all in
							terms of the highest commendation— My own was the last and equally
							strong. (v. 19. April last. p. 474) The letters from his family shew his
							affection and kindness for them— <persRef ref="u">Fournier</persRef>
							came to inform me of his arrangements for the funeral— I called at his
							house at 3 in the afternoon. Fournier was not at home— <persRef ref="u"
								>His wife</persRef> told me that Quinzard had been sensible and
							talked untill his last moment— That he had mentioned his intention to
							give her his silver spoons as a token of memorial, and of thanks for her
							kindness to him— I went there again at seven in the Evening— The
								<persRef ref="penguilli-alexandre">Abbé Penguilli</persRef>
							performed a short preparatory service, after which the Body was removed
							to the Catholic Church, where the Messe is to be said at ten O’Clock
							to-morrow morning. The abbé apologized to me for not having known me
							again, when he met me the other day at <persRef ref="cathcart-william"
								>Lord Cathcart’s</persRef> house.— I read prayers this day for the
							fourth Sunday after Trinity, and <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon upon the precept to follow Peace— In the
							Evening I walked in the Summer-Garden which was full of Company— I am
							this day forty-six years of age, and have had a special occasion by the
							scene of mortality before me to solemnize my thoughts for the day.— Poor
							Quinzard was but three years older than myself— Like me he was a
							stranger and a sojourner <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> in this land;
							but he had been driven from his native Country by that Hurricane, which
							swept away men of all Conditions alike; and though neither absolutely
							poor nor friendless, he was obliged in his last moments to call for my
							good offices, to enable him to die in Peace, and to save <persRef
								ref="quinzard-marc">his brother</persRef> from being plundered of
							the fruits of his Industry and Economy, which he destined for him. In
							undertaking to execute his last intentions I assumed a responsibility
							which Prudence might have directed me to decline; but my intentions were
							upright, and I pray that the purpose may be accomplished. <persRef
								ref="meyer-jc">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer</persRef> called
							on me this Morning, and I consulted him with regard to the necessity of
							having the Will registered— He thought it not necessary, and said that
							if I should, it would occasion both trouble and expence— I also
							consulted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer about remitting the money
							left by Quinzard to his brother; and concerning some affairs of my
							own.</p>

							They gave me a large bundle of letters and dispatches from the

							upon our business— The first object is that they should be presented to
							the <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Chancellor</persRef>, for which
							some essential preparatory arrangements require a delay of one or two
							days— I dined at the Count’s, mentioned to him the arrival of my

							After dinner, the Count introduced me to <persRef

						<p><date>23. </date><persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> brought the
							Credential letter of the extraordinary mission, of which a copy and
							translation are to be delivered to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and he asked me to make the Translation,
							which I promised.— I went to <persRef ref="colombi-maria">Countess
								Colombi’s</persRef> to make some inquiries concerning the <persRef
									ref="destutt-victor">Major de Tracy</persRef>, whose liberation I
							was requested to endeavour to obtain— I wished to see <persRef
								ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zea</persRef>, but he was not at home— I saw <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lys</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="colombi-donfrancisco">Don Francisco</persRef>— They had
							furnished money to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy, and I
							enquired whether they knew any thing further concerning him; which how
							ever they did not.— At one I called as by appointment upon Count
							Romanzoff, and told him that I had received instructions from the
							American Government to remain here under the Commission which I have
							hitherto held, and that I had been mistaken in supposing that my
							Colleagues had other destinations, independent of the mission here— My
							conjecture had been founded on the doubt whether the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> would have appointed this
							Mission solely, upon the expectation that the mediation would be
							accepted by the British Government.— But I was now instructed that the
							President, considering the acceptance by the British as probable, though
							aware that if they should reject it, this measure might wear the
							appearance of precipitation, thought it more advisable to incur that
							risque, than the danger of prolonging unnecessarily the War, for six or
							nine Months, as might happen, if the British should immediately have
							accepted the Mediation, and he should have delayed this step untill he
							was informed of it. And a great object with him was to manifest not only
							a cheerful acceptance on the part of the United States, but in a signal
							manner the sentiments of consideration and respect for the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and to do honour to the motives
							on which he offered his Mediation— Another Gentleman, <persRef
								ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> was appointed Minister to France. The Count said
							he regretted much that there was such reason to believe the British
							would decline the Mediation; but on transmitting the copy of our
							Credential letter to the Emperor, he would determine whether to renew
							the proposal, as the Opposition in England might make it an embarrassing
							charge, against the Ministry if they should under such Circumstances
							reject it— He spoke of the taking of York-town in Upper Canada, by
								<persRef ref="dearborn-henry">General Dearborn</persRef>; and
							desiring me not to mention him as an Authority, added that he was
							informed the British Government had determined in consequence of that
							event to send more troops to America.— I told the Count there were two
							other objects not connected with either of my public Capacities here,
							but upon which I found it necessary to speak to him— The first was
							concerning a payment made to the owners of a Vessel to which a black man
							belonged, who had entered into the Emperor’s service— This payment was
							made, by way of indemnity for the detention of the vessel— I had been
							directed by a verbal message from the <persRef ref="balashov-alexander"
								>Minister of the Police Balascheff</persRef> to offer this
							indemnity; and I related to the Count the circumstances of the man’s
							having got into the Emperor’s service— The Count asked what the amount
							of the payment was— I said it was about 700 dollars, amounting to more
							than 3000 Rubles— He said he would write upon the subject to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Balacheff— The other subject I observed
							was still more remote from my official functions, for it related to a
							French Prisoner— My only motives and my excuse for speaking of it to him
							were humanity and gratitude. <persRef ref="lafayette">General La
								Fayette</persRef> had written to me, requesting me to endeavour to
							obtain a favour for a relation of his a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							de Tracy, now at Tamboff, and taken last Winter with <persRef
								ref="augereau-pierre">Augereau</persRef>— On the score of gratitude
							for General La Fayette’s services to my Country, and of a very old
							personal friendship for him, I was ardently desirous of rendering him
							any service in my power— What he, and the Senator <persRef
								ref="destutt-antoine">Count de Tracy</persRef> the Prisoner’s father
							wanted was either an exchange, or a release on parole— The Count said he
							did not think it would be possible— The french had refused to listen to
							any proposition for exchange— An English Officer named <persRef
								ref="willoughby-nesbit">Willoughby</persRef> had come here last
							Summer and offered his services— He had been sent to <persRef
								ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count Wittgenstein’s</persRef> army, and by
							lending his horse to a wounded Russian, whom he had even carried some
							way upon his shoulders, he had fallen into the Enemy’s hands— The
							Emperor had asked to have him exchanged, and had been positively
							refused—in consequence of which he had resolved he would listen to no
							applications of a similar Nature— However if I would give him the
							Officer’s name, he would write to the Emperor about it; and although
							there was no prospect of obtaining an exchange, there might possibly be
							a permission for his removal—perhaps for him to come to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg; that I might then enter into
							correspondence with him, and his situation might be alleviated— I
							replied that I would give him the name, and as it was altogether a
							favour I was asking, I should be grateful for any thing that might be
							granted— The Count agreed with me to receive my Colleagues with me at
							11. to-morrow Morning; and said that at 12 he should set out for Czarsko
							Zelo, to spend two or three days there— I spoke of the presentation of
							my <persRef ref="gallatin-albert;bayard-james">Colleagues</persRef> and
							myself to the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna;elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empresses</persRef>— He said that the <pb n="504" type="ms"
							/>Empresses in the Country had received two or three private Strangers;
							but that they could not receive persons in such a public character as
							that of Envoys Extraordinary, unless they had been previously received
							by the Emperor; or untill the Emperor should give his orders on
							receiving the copy of the Credential letter— He might perhaps direct
							that the Gentlemen should be considered as having delivered the letter
							to him in person— Or if he should return here as it was sometimes said
							he soon intended, we might then really deliver it— This is a change of
							opinion since the Count spoke with me on this subject before— In General
							there appears a coolness in his manner which leads me to suspect that
							the Emperor himself is not well pleased at the eclat which this mission
							will give to the British refusal of his mediation— The Count’s
							politeness is as marked and warm as ever, but there is a reserve and
							sollicitude in the manner, which I regret to perceive— I went from his
							house to the lodgings of my Colleagues and informed them of the time
							fixed for presenting them to the Count— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin then put into my hands the three Full-powers which contain our
							Commissions— One to negotiate the Peace with Britain, under the
							Mediation of the Emperor of Russia— One to negotiate a Treaty of
							Commerce with Britain given for the contingency that the pacific
							Negotiation should be successful— In these two M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin is the first Commissioner, and I am the second—the
							third power is to negotiate a Treaty of Commerce with Russia, in which
							as well as in the Credential Letter, my name is the first and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s the second. This arrangement
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin told me was made
							intentionally, and I consider it as a mark of delicate attention in the
							President towards me, though I should have been perfectly satisfied had
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s name been first in all the
							papers— I took the Powers for treating of Peace with Britain, and of
							Commerce with Russia, home with me, and made translations of them and of
							the Credential letter which I carried to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris’s, when I went to dinner— We all dined there; together with
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="lewis-john">Lewis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="willing-richard">Willing</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Redwood</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Calhoun</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin corrected my translations of the
							papers, and after dinner we took a long walk over the Isaac Square
							Bridge, and round by the new Exchange— I came home between 9 and 10 in
							the Evening.</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>, and presented
							them to him.— He received us in his Salloon above Stairs, with his usual
							Courtesy— After some conversation upon the familiar and ordinary topics,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin gave him the copies and
							translations of the Credential letter, and the two Powers, observing
							that we should address a Note to him on the subject; but that we now
							furnished him with the papers to give him an immediate view, by
							anticipation of the extent of our Powers— I mentioned to him that the
							object of one of them was to form a Treaty of Commerce with Russia; upon
							which he answered that we might be very sure of being listened to in
							every thing we might have to say <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. He said
							there might be reason to hope that the British Government would be more
							inclined to negotiate now, as upon the only remaining great object of
							dispute with us, he understood Congress had lately passed a Law, which
							must take away a great part of the British grounds of complaint. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin added that besides this Law, if
							any thing further was necessary to tranquilize Britain upon the point of
							which she complained, we were authorised to agree to any expedient that
							might be proposed, and which would be compatible with the rights of an
							Independent Nation— The only point indispensible on our part, being to
							obtain a stipulation which should protect our Seamen from impressment—
							The Count spoke of the late capture of York in Upper-Canada, and asked
							if it would not give us the command of the lakes— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said we might hope it would lead
							to the occupation of Upper-Canada; and that the command of the Lakes
							could not be contested against us after we had built vessels upon them.
							The British having always had a few vessels there, and we none, untill
							the War— I gave the Count a paper with the name and situation of
							<persRef ref="destutt-victor">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Tracy</persRef>, on it as he had yesterday requested— He said he
							would attend to it, and I might be sure nothing would prevent the
							application from succeeding but what he had mentioned to me— On our
							taking leave both the gentlemen gave him private letters which they had
							for him from <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daschkoff</persRef>— He asked us on what day we should
							be disengaged to dinner— He should return from Czarsko Zelo on Tuesday;
							would Wednesday or Thursday suit us—we said either—then he said he
							should take the shortest day, and would send us Cards for Wednesday. I
							went home with the gentlemen, and sat a couple of hours with them— We
							agreed to meet on Monday at 11 O’Clock at my house, to discuss the
							project of a Note to the Count, and to pay personal visits to the
							foreign Ministers on that and the next day. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin enquired of me on what footing <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> was here and I told him of the two Commissions he
							had received, and of the number of times I had written to the Department
							of State concerning him without receiving any Answer— He said that the
							State <pb n="505" type="ms"/>Department always had that habit they never
							decided any thing—always postponed. But by the Law of 2 May 1810 no
							payment could be allowed at the Treasury for a Secretary of Legation, or
							private Secretary, unless regularly appointed with the concurrence of
							the Senate— That Law of 2 May 1810. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard spoke of as <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">Bradley’s</persRef>
							Law— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said it was <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">Robert Smith’s</persRef> Law, or rather, the
							Smith’s law; it was introduced the very last day of the Session, carried
							by <persRef ref="burwell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burwell</persRef> the organ of the Smith’s in the House of
							Representatives, into the House and read three times on the same
							day—presented to the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> at
							ten O’Clock at Night with a number of other Bills, at the moment when
							the Session was closing— And afterwards R. Smith had affected to make
							this very law an Article of attack upon the President— I said I had seen
							in an Answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s publication a
							statement that it would probably be repealed. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin said that the President had made no appointment
							under it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard thought that <persRef
								ref="barlow-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Barlow</persRef> had been appointed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin said he had been nominated; but some difficulty had occurred,
							and the nomination had been withdrawn— For in the late dispute between
								<persRef ref="warden-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Warden</persRef> and young Barlow at Paris, <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin that Barlow had been
							right; because he supposed himself to have an appointment— I observed
							that a provision was made in all the appropriation Laws for a Secretary
							of Legation here; and no other appointment having been made, I had paid
							the Salary to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, constantly
							requesting and expecting Instructions— I had at least supposed they
							would have brought some, but there is not a word upon the subject in the
							dispatches they have brought.— It was between 3 and 4 O’Clock when I
							came home— After dinner I went with <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fishwick’s</persRef>— His term commences again next

								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Montreal</persRef> were here, but I

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							came, and we had a conference of about three hours— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin took his first sketch of our
							proposed Note to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>, with the translation, and additional paragraphs
							I had drawn up, for the purpose of making a final draft of the Note.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had proposed the suggestion
							of some ideas on the probable rejection of the Mediation, by Great
							Britain— I had accordingly introduced them— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard thought it would be best to make no reference to this
							prospect at-all, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin finally
							came over to his opinion— I desired them to determine it between
							themselves, being ready either to introduce or omit those suggestions as
							they should think best.— We had much Conversation upon a variety of
							topics connected with the objects of our Mission— <pb n="506" type="ms"
								/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard though much better than he
							was yesterday, was still so unwell that he thought it would be best to
							postpone our further visits to the Corps diplomatique for some days.—
							After dinner I rode out with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							Catherinenhoff.</p>

									>r</hi> Bayard</persRef> being still unwell did not come— He had
							made a draft of a Note to be sent to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> differing still
							from that which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and I had
							prepared— We now compared them all together, and agreed upon one to be
							composed of the three; and which is to be given to <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> to make out a fair Copy to be sent—
							We dined at Count Romanzoff’s with the usual diplomatic company.
								<persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="markoff-arkady">Count Markoff</persRef>, and the
							Generals <persRef ref="tormasov-alexander">Tormassoff</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="armfeldt-gustaf">Armfelt</persRef> were there— The
								<persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de

								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef> was absent— I sat
							next to the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier
								Bardaxi-Azara</persRef>, on one side, and <persRef
								ref="gorgoli-ivan">General Gorgoly</persRef> on the other— <persRef
								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> told me that the Armistice
							was prolonged to 10. August, with the additional six days of notice. In
							the mean time a preliminary to a Congress was to meet at Prague—
								<persRef ref="metternick-klemons">Count Metternich</persRef> from
							Austria as the Mediator, <persRef ref="narbonne-louis">Count de
								Narborne</persRef> from France—<persRef ref="u">Arnstett</persRef>
							from Russia—<persRef ref="vonhumboldt-wilhelm">Humboldt</persRef> from
							Prussia, and <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> from
							England— They were to try to agree upon a <hi rend="italic">Basis</hi>
							for Negotiation, and if they could the Congress was to assemble at
							Prague— In the mean time it was said, that an <hi rend="italic"
								>eventual</hi> Alliance offensive and Defensive between Russia and
							Austria was concluded— I asked how the <hi rend="italic">Mediation</hi>
							and the <hi rend="italic">Alliance</hi> were conciliated together— He
							said by the Alliances being <hi rend="italic">eventual</hi>— He thinks
							however the Negotiation will come to nothing— That <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> is only gaining time and
							will finish by breaking all up, and renewing the War— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bardaxi as we sat at table told me that
								<persRef ref="dallas-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dallas</persRef> had a letter for him from the <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Spanish Minister</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">Non-reconnu</hi> at Washington.— I said that it was to
							be hoped he would be <hi rend="italic">reconnu</hi> in time— The
							American Government had perhaps thought the example of Spain a good one,
							and having had three or four years during the War of our Revolution a
							Minister Non-reconnu in Spain, had reserved the acknowledgment of the
							Spanish Minister untill the end of the contest for Spain— He said Spain
							had not to be sure acknowledged our Minister, but had aided us in our
							War; I said we had also aided them in theirs: particularly in the
							Article of Provisions; which he admitted— I spoke to General Armfeldt
							after dinner, and requested him to repeat my thanks to <persRef
								ref="aminoff-johan">General Aminoff</persRef>, for the Medal he
							lately sent me— Count Romanzoff told me that he had written upon the
							subject of my application in behalf of <persRef ref="destutt-victor"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy</persRef>, not to the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, but to <persRef
								ref="arakcheyev-aleksey">Count Araktcheieff</persRef>, because the
							Emperor might have thought he had given the order to permit M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy to come to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and have said it was very
							well, and not have answered the letter— But Count Araktcheieff must
							answer his letter— He had therefore written him that my request was that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy might be exchanged; or
							permitted to go home on Parole— That he had not thought himself
							authorized to give me any expectation this could be granted, but that he
							had urged his wish to do as much as possible as a favour to me, and
							asked that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Tracy might be allowed to
							come to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and put into my
							Custody; which he hoped would be obtained— I had some conversation also
							on general political subjects with <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr"
								>Count Soltykoff</persRef>. I took a short walk in the Evening— The
							Neptune arrived this day at Cronstadt.</p>

						<p><date>29. </date>I took <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							to school this morning; he went with some reluctance— On returning home
							I found the <persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">father General of the
								Jesuits Brzozowsky</persRef>, who had called to offer his
							congratulations on the arrival of my Colleagues. I had stop’d at
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris’s</persRef> to tell him that Count Romanzoff had fixed twelve
							O’Clock this day to receive us. He shewed me his Commission which is
							only for the Negotiation of Peace and of the Treaty of Commerce with
							England— At Noon I went with him and presented him as Secretary to the
							Mission to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>.
							He received us with his usual courtesy and urbanity— I asked him if the
							Rumours of the prolongation of the Armistice untill the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August, besides the six days Notice
							were true? He said he had no doubt they were, but that neither he, nor
							the <persRef ref="gorchakov-aleksey">minister of War</persRef>, had one
							syllable of information, not merely of the fact, but even of there being
							any such intention— He said he had received yesterday a letter from
								<persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef>, the first
							he had written him since he had been at the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Head-Quarters— He notified him of the intention
							of the British Government to send a Secretary of Embassy to remain here
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, and in the mean time
							requested him to deliver Passports on the application of <persRef
								ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							(the British Consul.) He had certainly never refused M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey any Passports and did not know why
							this request was addressed to him— The Count expressed without reserve
							his disapprobation of the armistice and of its prolongation. He said
							that every thing was done too much in a hurry to be well done— I said
							that I supposed he would not consider the Congress at Prague to settle
							whether there should be a Congress at Prague, as an overhasty measure—
							Yes—he thought it was— There was a very simple preliminary question— Was
							a general Peace at this time possible? Every body must answer—No!—it was
								<pb n="507" type="ms"/>obviously <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Napoleon’s</persRef> object by the armistice to gain time, and
							nothing more— He would improve that time to the utmost, for his own
							advantage, and he the Count therefore thought it was wrong to let him
							have the opportunity— Another instance of hastiness the Count said was
							in the Council of Administration which had been very formally organized
							for the Countries between the Oder and the Elbe— Je me reproche encore
							ma gaieté, said he when <persRef ref="lowenhielm-gustaf">Count
								Löwenhielm</persRef> came to me very gravely to give me Notice that
							his Court had appointed a member of the Swedish Council to take his seat
							in this Council of Administration— He seemed to expect that it was a
							step which would have met with some opposition, for he laid it down
							somewhat elaborately that according to the Spirit of the Alliance,
							Sweden considered herself as having a right to appoint a member to the
							Council of Administration— I laughed and told him I was very glad to
							hear it. That I presumed the more members there were appointed to the
							Council of Administration, the more there was to administer. But really
							there seems now but little for the Council of Administration to do— If
							they were an Assembly of Solon’s, it is but a small number of People
							indeed that they can make happy by their Laws— I asked if Count
							Löwenhielm had arrived at the Head-Quarters— He had no news of his
							arrival, and the messenger he had given to accompany him had not
							returned— After going home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris I
							called upon my Colleagues— <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> was gone out; I saw
							only <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, with whom I had two hours of Conversation, all
							upon general subjects— <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Todd</persRef> came in while I was there—he arrived in
							the ship the Evening before last, and came up from Cronstadt last
							Evening— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to consult
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard on the propriety of our taking
							notice of this Negotiation for a general Peace, of which there appears
							to be now a considerable prospect.— On the supposition that
							Great-Britain should eventually reject the Mediation of Russia, and that
							the Congress for a general Peace should be held, I thought it should
							excite our particular attention— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							asked me to make the draft of a Note to Count Romanzoff, on the Subject
							of the Treaty of Commerce with Russia— I made one immediately after
							dinner, and took it to their lodgings, but found nobody at home.
								<persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
