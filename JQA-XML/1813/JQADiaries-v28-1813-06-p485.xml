							decided to-morrow— I told him that I wished not to be importunate; but
							that the house which was cautionary for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Redwood had last week received a second summons to pay the money, and
							that I understood when the third summons came the payment could no
							longer be delayed— He repeated the promise that the matter should be

								Blome</persRef> which side his Government was—French or against
							France— He answered laughing, but evasively.— Aye, said he, ask me that
							Question—but we shall soon know; it cannot last long—at least we have
							fired guns against both sides.— I asked him whether the Danes were at
							Hamburg— No! they had been there and evacuated it, by an order, on
								<persRef ref="bernstorff-christian">Count Bernstorff’s</persRef>
							return from England; where they had refused even to listen to his
							propositions— The Swedes were in possession of Hamburg, which they took
							two days after it was evacuated by the Danes— The late Battles in Saxony
							were on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> and 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of May; the combined
							armies were not at-all defeated; but they had merely retreated after
							them to draw on the French Army, untill Austria should march her troops,
							which was fixed for the 30<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of May—
							Napoleon and his army are again in the most imminent danger of having
							their retreat cut-off— In these last Battles he lost nearly double the
							number of men, that the combined army did—and prisoners; and
							Cannon—whereas they lost None— <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Caulaincourt</persRef> did come to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> Head-Quarters, but was not received—
								<persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef> next to whom
							I sat at table told me that there had been since this Battle a thousand
							false reports in Circulation; among others that one of the Russian
							Regiments had refused to obey his orders to fight— That there was a long
							letter of eight pages from the Emperor to <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna"
								>his Mother</persRef>, which had been seen by several persons, and
							even copies of it were circulated— That it gave at large his motives for
							retreating after the Battle; by <persRef ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count
								Wittgenstein’s</persRef> advice.— That he was fighting for the Cause
							of Europe; but that he ought not to risk too much the blood of his
							troops, when such a powerful ally was close at hand to share in the
							losses and in the struggle— Count Romanzoff asked me if I had received
							any late dispatches from America— I had not; but had seen in English
							Newspapers articles stating that <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff</persRef> had offered the
							Emperor’s Mediation, at Washington, which was immediately accepted— The
							Courier of 13 May says the British Government will refuse it. The Count
							had seen these papers, but said he had received no dispatches from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff— I observed that from the
							complexion of the Article in the Courier, it was not very important,
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff’s Communications might
							arrive; to which he assented— I had also some conversation with the
							Marquis de Traversey, who thinks the American and Russian Oak less
							durable than the English— After returning home I rode out with <persRef

							Reports are stupid falsehoods— The last is an impossibility. The Russian
							retreat must have been about 100 Versts in four or five days, and that
							is rapid enough, with an incumbrance of their wounded, and of their
							Artillery— And there would be no imaginable motive for keeping it
							secret, if Wittgenstein had been killed or wounded— It is but just now
							that the real issue of the battle of Lützen is coming to light— The
							accounts on both sides must be compared to collect the truth— The errors
							in the French relations are chiefly in the details— Those of the
							combined armies are in the result— The allies maintained the field on
							the day of battle— But they retreated the next Morning; and I marvel
							that they should have thought it an occasion for Te Deums.</p>

						<p><date>15. </date>At noon I called upon <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, according to his appointment. He told me
							he had received dispatches from <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff</persRef>, in answer, to the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> proposal of
							mediation, which he said appeared to have been completely successful. He
							then shewed me the copy of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef> Answer to the
							proposal, as made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff— It is
							dated 11. March, and in very handsome terms accepts the Mediation— It
							says that further arrangements will shortly be made to carry the
							acceptance into effect, of which he shall be duly informed— The Count
							added that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff informed him he
							should write him more at large as soon as possible. The Count said he
							was gratified that this measure had been so received by the United
							States, though from the manner in which it appeared to be considered in
							England, he could not flatter himself that it would have any further
							immediate effect— I said that my own expectations were the same; that by
							the manner in which it is considered by the Newspapers of all the great
							parties in England I saw no prospect of its acceptance there. The
							Courier, a ministerial Paper, had declared itself sure that it would be
							refused— The Times, a <persRef ref="wellesley-richard;wellington-arthur"
								>Wellesley</persRef> and <persRef ref="canning-george"
								>Canning</persRef> Paper had expressed its regret, at the interest
							taken by the Emperor, in this Mediation, and its reluctance at the
							Negotiation’s taking this turn— I had a private letter also mentioning
							that such was the general Sentiment of all parties in England— I
							regretted very much that this should be the result, but I was extremely
							gratified that the measure had been proposed, and at the frankness and
							readiness with which it had been accepted by my own Government—inasmuch
							as it had given them an opportunity to manifest to the Emperor and to
							the world their readiness and even eagerness for Peace; as well as the
							falsehood of what our enemies were taking such pains to propagate
							throughout the world; that we acted under the influence of France. The
							Count replied that he did not expect the Mediation would be directly
							refused by the British Government— It would cause some embarrassment to
							the Ministry. By a refusal they would incur a responsibility which they
							might hereafter find troublesome— But he believed they would give an
							evasive Answer, and renew the pretence that we were in subserviency to
							France— He nevertheless hoped that the measure would at a future day not
							be without its good effects.— He asked me if I had any later Accounts
							from America, and what was the state of the War— I had no accounts but
							such as came by the English Gazettes— I mentioned the Bombardment of
							Lewistown; and the Report of the destruction of Norfolk— The Application
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff’s Secretary to the British
							Admiral for a Cartel for a vessel to come here, dispatched by the
							Government of the United States, and the Report of Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> being destined to come out as
							Commissioners, of the accuracy of which I had my doubts— I presumed a
							Commission would be appointed; but I questioned whether they would be
							the men— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin could not easily be
							spared, and he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard were so
							opposite to each other in our politics that I thought it doubtful
							whether they would be joined in one Commission— The Count said that in a
							Government like ours that might be the very reason for joining them; so
							that the great opposing interests might be all represented. I admitted
							this, but thought it more likely to give rise to the report than to the
							reality.— He said he should this Evening write to the Emperor, and make
							him his Report of the Dispatch from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Daschkoff—he asked me therefore to send him the English Paper in which I
							had seen the Article concerning Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							Gallatin and Bayard: I accordingly sent him the slip of the Times of 18
							May which I received from <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley</persRef>.— I had some further
							conversation with the Count upon other subjects— I told him I had seen
							in the National Intelligencers that he had lent me, <persRef
								ref="barlow-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow’s</persRef>
							Correspondence with the <persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke of
								Bassano</persRef>, concerning the invitation to Wilna; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow’s Account of it to the American
							Secretary of State— I had been happy to observe M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Barlow’s remark, that if there were any other motives than
							those of treating concerning our Commerce, and our indemnities, he
							should know what answer to give— As it so fully confirmed the assurances
							that I had given to the Count on that occasion— He said he had noticed
							it in the Correspondence, and had always been fully convinced it was so—
							He asked me whether I had received an answer, concerning the papers of
							the Russian Embassy at Paris, of which he had spoken to me. I said I
							lamented that hitherto all my efforts to obtain an answer from Paris had
							been unsuccessful— That the person <pb n="490" type="ms"/>whom I had
							dispatched as a Courier had been very long in reaching Vienna— That he
							had even met with some obstructions and detentions on the road in
							Russia, owing I presumed to the peculiar situation of that part of the
							Country, at this time— That on his arrival at Vienna, he had found
							himself unexpectedly detained there; and had forwarded by mail, one of
							the two letters I had given him for Paris— This letter was in cypher,
							and I had authorized him in case he should himself be detained to
							forward it by Post— It has been received, and yesterday came to me an
							answer saying that they have no key to the cypher, and cannot read it— I
							had foreseen that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow might not have
							the key to my cypher, which had been with <persRef ref="armstrong-john"
								>his predecessor</persRef>, and had therefore given <persRef
								ref="delprat-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delprat</persRef>
							a duplicate, without cypher, to be delivered only by himself; and in
							consequence of his detention this letter had not been received. I had
							afterwards written again and sent my letter to be forwarded from
							Copenhagen— I had an answer to that also saying that the Communication
							between Copenhagen and France was interrupted, and my letter could not
							be transmitted— Then I had written a third time and dispatched my letter
							to be forwarded from Hamburg— But the bearer of it, who was going to
							England, on reaching Berlin found it dangerous to proceed to Hamburg;
							and had taken the way through Stralsund and Gothenburg— The Count
							observed that the Communication between Copenhagen and France he
							supposed was now restored and my letter sent through that channel might
							now reach its destination— I said I could not yet discover what the
							position of Denmark was, and of which side she was to be considered— He
							hesitated a little, and then said he believed Denmark would finally be
							fixed, as the friend of France in this War— That it seemed so since the
							positive refusal to hear <persRef ref="bernstorff-christian">Count
								Bernstorff</persRef> in England, and his return home— It could not
							be otherwise after that— Though now, added he, the Gazettes say, that
							the English Government have sent <persRef ref="hope-john2">General
								Hope</persRef> to Copenhagen.— There is said the Count, a want of
							combination in some of the proceedings— I had made dispositions which I
							hoped and yet believe might have secured Denmark to our Cause— But I
							have been disappointed— I said that the failure of Denmark might be of
							less importance since the Declaration of Austria, and the subsequent
							retreat of the French army— He said that he knew nothing of the Austrian
							Declaration, and did not believe there was sufficient Evidence that the
							French army had retreated— It had been said he had received an Estafette
							with the Austrian Declaration; which was not true— The letters from the
							Army, and even from the Emperor, speak of it as being confidently
							expected, and that very shortly. Days had even been fixed upon which the
							Austrians were to have commenced their hostilities—first the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> and afterwards the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of May— Both those days however had
							passed and they had not commenced— The Emperor had not written to him
							these fifteen days; the co-operation of Austria was promised as a
							certainty; but there is yet no Account of its having taken effect.— As
							to the Accounts of the retreat of the French army, they were from
							Berlin; where they had been excessively and needlessly alarmed, and
							where they had published every thing true or false that could tend to
							quiet the alarms of the People— He did not mean to say that there had
							been no danger to Berlin— Its danger was immense; but not exactly for
							that week— What motive could the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Emperor Napoleon</persRef> have for going to Berlin, while he had
							the combined army in presence before him?— But if he can oblige us to
							cross the Oder, what can hinder him afterwards from going to Berlin just
							when he pleases? I said that the possession of great Cities, always had
							on the popular sentiment a more powerful impression than it deserved.
							There was hardly a Capital in Europe, but had been taken and retaken
							time after time. People seemed to think it was putting an end to the
							War; but it scarcely ever had been so.— The Count said that Governments
							were apt to comply too much with this popular panic on the occupation of
							great Cities.— Napoleon however paid very little attention to it.— He
							followed his own course, and let people clamour to their hearts Content—
							He knew that all such <hi rend="italic">piaulement</hi>, signified
							nothing at all in the course of Events— And it reminded him of a saying
							of his father’s—<persRef ref="rumiantsev-pyotr">Marshal
								Romanzoff</persRef>— In the midst of a great Battle some Soldier in
							a moment of particular danger had loudly exclaimed to him “I will <hi
								rend="italic">die</hi> with you”— Upon which the Marshal instantly
							answered as loudly—“Away! go and <hi rend="italic">die</hi> with whom
							you will! I want none but such as will <hi rend="italic">live</hi> with
							me!” a sentiment said the Count, which I think as judicious as it was
							well-timed.— The Count appeared at once inclined to be communicative,
							and restrained by motives of Prudence from speaking out freely, and I
							forbore to press him upon topics, with which I had no immediate concern—
							He <hi rend="strikethrough">asked whether I had any news as to the state
								of our War with England— I mentioned the destruction of Lewistown;
								the reported Bombardment of Norfolk, and the capture of the Peacock,
								by the Hornet—</hi> He said that by the late English Newspapers that
							he had seen there appeared to be a most extraordinary and wonderful
							stagnation of every thing of general interest.— The <persRef
								ref="caroline-brunswick">Princess of Wales’s</persRef> Virtue and the
							Cossack, seemed to have absorbed all <pb n="491" type="ms"/>the
							contemplations of the English Nation— He is evidently not satisfied with
							the course which things are taking, though he speaks with great caution
							and reserve— After dinner I walked round the Fontanka, and through the
							Summer-gardens. <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>22. </date>I received this morning a Note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, requesting me to
							call upon him at 1. O’Clock afternoon, which I did. I took with me the
							French Translation of the two Papers containing the Manifesto on our
							Declaration of War against Britain; which are to be published— I
							explained to him the reason why the two pieces were to be taken as
							comprizing the single Manifesto— He said they should be published—that
							he had written to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>,
							charging himself with the wrong of having permitted the publication of
							the Commentary, which had accompanied the English Manifesto, in the
							Russian and German Gazettes, and informing him that he had promised me
							the American Manifesto, without Commentary should be published in the
							same papers.— I told him I should send him the Russian and German
							Translations when they should be completed— I also shewed him and left
							with him the National Intelligencer, containing the Article relative to
							the Appointment of Messieurs <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="bayard-james"
							>Bayard</persRef>, which I received yesterday;—observing that he had
							judged more correctly than I had on the probability of this fact— He
							said that he was very sorry to say he had received since he saw me
							further dispatches from <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>, stating that the British
							Government with many very friendly and polite assurances that there was
							no Mediation which they should so readily and cheerfully accept as that
							of the Emperor of Russia, had however stated that their differences with
							the United States of America, involving certain principles of the
							internal Government of England, were of a Nature which they did not
							think suitable to be settled by a Mediation— I said this was no more
							than I had expected— That I much regretted the failure of this new
							attempt at Negotiation, but that I was happy the solemnity which the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> had given to the
							acceptance of the Emperor’s offer, by the appointment of two persons so
							highly distinguished in our Country, would at least manifest the sense
							which he entertained of the Emperor’s friendly sentiments and proposal,
							as well as the constant desire of the American Government for Peace— He
							said it was the light in which he had already represented it to the
							Emperor, and it would now be for consideration, whether after the step
							thus taken by the American Government, it would not be advisable to
							renew the proposition to Great-Britain; upon which he should write to
							the Emperor. Perhaps it might be proper not to be discouraged by the
							ill-success of the first Advances.— After considerations might produce
							more pacific dispositions in the British Government— Unexpected things
							were happening every day; and in our own affairs said the Count, a very
							general report prevails that an armistice has taken place— I said I had
							for the last four or five days heard rumours of that sort in
							circulation, and had intended to ask him, if I might without
							indiscretion, whether they were true— He said they were. He had no doubt
							they were. He had received no official account of it— The Emperor had
							not written to him— The multitude of his occupations sufficiently
							explained this— The Emperor, did every thing himself— He was Emperor,
							Commander in Chief, Quarter-Master, and in short superintended every
							thing— It was therefore perfectly natural that he had not found time to
							write to him; and from motives of delicacy, he did not permit any other
							person to write to him; so that he had received nothing official on this
							subject. But there were letters from the army which ascertained the
							fact, and indeed <persRef ref="lowenhielm-gustaf">Count
								Löwenhielm</persRef> had received it officially from the <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Prince Royal of Sweden</persRef> to whom it
							had been communicated.— There was also an Article in the Berlin Gazette
							of 8 June, mentioning that a Russian and a French Officer had passed
							through that City from the respective Head-Quarters bound to
							Hamburg—they were doubtless sent to extend the armistice to the troops
							in that quarter— I asked him whether the Prince of Sweden and his troops
							were included in the armistice— He supposed so—for what length of time
							was it?—for five or six weeks.— I had heard it was to the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of July— It must be about that— I had
							seen also a proposal mentioned for a Congress at Prague— Yes, there was
							such a proposal, and the United States are expressly named among the
							powers to be invited to it— But in this universal state of War, partial
							Peaces seem hardly (said he) to be an adequate remedy— The <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> proposed the
							armistice— I suppose that it was hunger that led to the proposal— He
							wanted it for a longer time, but the five or six weeks was all that they
							could agree upon—that will bring them to the new harvest— I said <pb
								n="493" type="ms"/>I hoped it would bring them at least to the
							prospect of Peace— The Count did not appear to expect it.— I then
							mentioned the expectation I had of the arrival of my new Colleagues at
							Cronstadt; which might be from hour to hour— And asked if they could be
							presented to the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna;elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empresses</persRef> in the Emperor’s absence— He said he believed
							they might to the Empress Mother, who had a Court of her own and
							received Company at Pavlofsky— But the Empress Elizabeth was at
							Czarsko-Selo quite in retirement, and saw nobody— I asked if it would be
							necessary to give any order that they might not be delayed at Cronstadt.
							He said that an order might be necessary for the admission of their
							baggage; and if I would write him a couple of lines of a note,
							mentioning my expectation of their arrival, he would take upon himself
							the charge to make all the proper arrangements.— I told him that I
							presumed the President of the United States had not made these
							Appointments without being aware that the British Government might
							reject the Mediation, and thus leave us nothing to do. I concluded
							therefore that he had a second object in sending them both—that one of
							them was destined to succeed me here, and that the other would probably
							have another destination— He said, perhaps to France?— I said I could
							not tell—it was merely my conjecture— He replied that if it was to
							France, he should have no objection— He thought the maxim of <persRef
								ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef> the Censor very good in Politics;
							though he detested it in every thing else— He meant the rule of always
							hating your Enemy, as if he was one day to be your friend; and loving
							your friend as if he might one day be your enemy.— He added some
							expressions of civility upon the information that I expected to have a
							successor, and to leave this Country; with much regret that I should not
							have the opportunity of taking a part in the Negotiation for Peace— I
							thanked him for his good opinion, and assured him that nothing could be
							so gratifying to my own wishes, as to have the means of contributing to
							produce Peace; but that while England should refuse to treat I must
							acquiesce in the consequences, and give up the hope of labouring in so
							good a work— I was with the Count about half an hour.— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							had paid me a morning visit just before I went out— After dinner I
							called at <persRef ref="aminoff-johan">General Aminoff’s</persRef>
							lodgings to thank him for his present of a Medal; but he left the City
							yesterday morning for Sweaborg, and will be absent three or four Months.

								>Prince Kutuzoff Smolensky</persRef>— The Catafalque is in the
							centre of the Church immediately under the Dome. A Cubic Basis, and
							about twelve feet high with steps to ascend at the four Corners. There
							is an Arch in the middle of it high enough for a man to pass through;
							the Coffin is placed at the summit, on bars over a cavity large enough
							to let it down by machinery— The Coffin is said to weigh 60 Poods, about
							a Ton, avoirdupois. It is surrounded by Trophies—French Eagles and
							Standards, and Bashaw’s Horse-Tails. all round the basis are rows of
							large tapers to be lighted. The whole fabric which is of painted wood
							appears to be rested on four fluted Corinthian pillars at the four
							Corners— A figure of Fame, or of an Angel with a crown of laurel in one
							hand hovers over the coffin, suspended by a Rope from the summit of the
							Dome. On the two sides of the catafalque are ranged stools with velvet
							Cushions on each of which is placed some mark of dignity which he had
							acquired. The sword, the Marshal’s Truncheon, the Orders of the Prussian
							Black and Red Eagles, the Austrian order of Maria Theresa, and the

								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> called upon me according
							to his promise, and had a long Conversation with me upon political
							affairs— He thinks there will be no Peace between Russia and France, and
							excepting with relation to his own Government he knows Nothing but what
							is nearly public— He says Denmark has been forced into a new Alliance
							with France, when she would have been glad to join in the Alliance
							against her— That there is neither harmony nor Combination in the views
							or operations of the Allies— That Russia and England are not agreed—that
							the British Ministry sent here “<hi rend="italic">un imbecille</hi>,[”]
							for their <persRef ref="cathcart-william">Ambassador</persRef>— That the
								<persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">Prince Royal of Sweden</persRef>, is
							making dupes of them all— That they are paying him with the design that
							he should attack France, against which he will never fire a musket, and
							that he intends to make them pay him richly for despoiling and
							plundering Denmark, and all the time be clamorous at their
							non-fulfilment of their Treaties with him. That England had stipulated
							the payment of the subsidy should not commence untill he had landed in
							Pomerania; but that when <persRef ref="bernstorff-christian">Count
								Bernstorff</persRef> went to England, the Crown Prince sent word
							that he would not embark for Pomerania, unless Bernstorff was rejected
							without a hearing— That he had always protested to the Danish Chargé
							d’Affairs at Stockholm that Denmark should be amply indemnified, more
							than indemnified for Norway. He had offered the Hanseatic Cities, and
							even <pb n="495" type="ms"/>Holland—any thing—any where—pushing the
							hypocrisy to shedding of tears, but well knowing that all his promises
							of indemnity were mere words, signifying nothing.— The <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> had sent <persRef
								ref="dolgorukov-ivan">Prince Dolgorucki</persRef> to Copenhagen— The
							Prince, for the sake of conciliating Denmark had gone perhaps a little
							further than was warranted by his instructions— He had declared that
							Russia had not <hi rend="italic">positively</hi> guaranteed Norway to
							Sweden; but only on the condition that Denmark should be indemnified for
							the cession— Upon that basis, the <persRef ref="frederick-vi">king of
								Denmark</persRef> had consented to treat; but when the Swedish Crown
							Prince heard what Dolgorucki had done, he immediately insisted that it
							should be disavowed and that he should be recalled, which was done— That
							after all this Denmark had renewed her Negotiations with France— There
							had been actual hostilities, between the Danes at Hamburg and the
							French— The king had as a matter of form disavowed their occupation of
							that City— <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> had
							demanded that the commanding Officer should be dismissed and
							punished—the king had removed him from that command, but would not
							disgrace him— All this France knew was mere form— There was no duplicity
							in the conduct of Denmark— He was sure that in substance they had
							explicitly avowed to France every thing they had done; which was fully
							justified by the Circumstances; and there was not a word of truth in the
							Story, the Crown Prince had published at Stralsund, that while <persRef
								ref="kass-frederik">President Kaas</persRef>, was treating with
								<persRef ref="davoust-louis">D’Avoust</persRef> at Haarburg, he sent
							a verbal message to <persRef ref="vontettenborn-friedrich">General
								Tettenborn</persRef> at Hamburg that the king of Denmark was ready
							to join the coalition with 25000 men against France.— Blome added that
							he had no late information from his Government— His Communications were
							very much interrupted— He could seldom write but through Sweden, and
							throughout the whole of last Winter, not one dispatch between him and
							his Government had been suffered to pass— Every one of them had been
							intercepted— At this outrage, as at many others, Denmark to avoid
							bringing things to extremities had shut her eyes— <persRef

								Rosenkrantz</persRef>, when the “troupeau de Ministres” arrived off
							Copenhagen, from Stralsund; with Rosenkrantz’s answer; which was in
							terms of great moderation— The Danish Government had published them
							both, and the public Spirit had been excited to the highest indignation
							by the terms proposed— The public Spirit was the same in Norway,
							although in the Grand Balliage of Drontheim the famine was so severe
							that forty persons perished daily with hunger— They were cut off from
							all supplies; but they only wanted to go and find their granaries in
							Sweden— The King had sent the heir to the Crown into Norway; but so
							closely and narrowly was the coast watched that he had been obliged to
							go over, disguised as a Sailor— Lisakewitz on the 8<hi

							but expected it— Blome himself has received no order for his departure;
							but Count Löwenhielm, whom he had seen at <persRef ref="u">Countess
								Tolstoi’s</persRef>, and who had received a Courier in four or five
							days from Stockholm had told him he had official advices of the

							but that if Sweden has Norway, England can never keep Zeeland, because
							the Sound can at all times be passed in spite of any fleet.— He is in
							great anxiety and alarm; and expects that an attack will immediately be

								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gibson</persRef>— This
							Gentleman intends to leave the City in three or four weeks, and I
							promised to procure a Courier’s Passport for him and to give him
							dispatches— After dinner I rode out with <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and walked round the Strogonoff Garden. I walked
							from the Summer Garden alone home. Met <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Schulepoff</persRef>, the under
							Secretary in the department of foreign Affairs. He told me that <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, immediately
							after receiving my note, mentioning my expectation of the arrival of
							Messieurs <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, had given official notice of it
							to the <persRef ref="detraversay-ivan">Marquis de Traversey</persRef>,
							the Marine Minister, and to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff</persRef> the Minister of the
							Finances; so that every arrangement for their arrival, and the landing
							of their baggage would be made— I also met <persRef ref="bates-unknown"
								>Captain Bates</persRef> and <persRef ref="hurd-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hurd</persRef>—the former of whom
							told me that the English papers of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							contained accounts from Halifax of 3. May—and brought the news, that the
							Essex Frigate was taken, and that we had suffered another defeat in
							Canada.— News not the less painful for being expected.</p>

						<p><date>30. </date>I took a warm Bath this morning
							before Breakfast— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Redwood</persRef> called on me, still anxious and uncertain
							concerning the prosecution for a penalty hanging over him, for an
							importation of prohibited Articles— I wrote another Note upon the
							subject to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Gourieff</persRef> the
							Minister of Finance.— After my Evening walk I read some pages of
								<persRef ref="jortin-john">Jortin’s</persRef> Remarks upon
							Ecclesiastical History; which are loaded with a great multiplicity of
							Greek and Latin Citations, but are very amusing.— Some of them are
							rather rank, for the subject, and the author, a Clergyman. On the
							Apostolical Constitutions, the Jewish Sects of Pharisees, Sadducees and
							Essenes, and the Sibylline Oracles and verses there is much curious
							information— Some of the Essenes it says never married because they
							believed all married women unfaithful— Jortin asks how they could honour
							their fathers and <hi rend="italic">mothers</hi>?— <persRef
								ref="laharpe-jean">La Harpe</persRef> has I think a similar
							observation upon <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal’s</persRef> 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> Satire— The other day at the <persRef
								ref="kutuzov-mikhail">Field Marshal’s</persRef> funeral procession
							we had this subject discussed between <persRef ref="lowenhielm-gustaf"
								>Count Löwenhielm</persRef>, <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count
								Maistre</persRef> and the <persRef ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier
								Bardaxi</persRef>— Lowenhielm was remarking the resemblance between
							Count Maistre and <persRef ref="demaistre-xavier">his brother</persRef>—
							Bardaxi observed upon it the general resemblance which usually runs
							through families— Löwenhielm said that when brothers had not the same
							father this resemblance was very apt to fail, and added that he believed
							there were few, very few women indeed who did not give their children
							more than one father— I told him that was only the opinion of a
							libertine; but as both the other gentlemen fell foul of him, as
							champions of the sex, I took no further part in the discussion—
							Löwenhielm had the worst of the argument— But he may have taken his
							opinion from his own family— He and <persRef ref="lowenhielm-carl">his
								brother</persRef> are supposed to have had two fathers— <hi
								rend="italic">He</hi> bears a very strong and unequivocal
							resemblance to the nuptial father, my old friend <persRef
								ref="lowenhielm-fredrik">Count Löwenhielm</persRef>, whom I knew as
							Swedish Minister at the Hague— His brother has not a feature of that
							resemblance, and is reputed to be the Son of the present <persRef
								ref="charles-xiii">king of Sweden</persRef>, whom he does resemble.
							So that it may be his way of honouring his <persRef
								ref="lowenhielm-augusta">Mother</persRef>, to consider her frailty
							as that of the whole sex.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The only difference between this and the

							I rise accordingly seldom before seven— Sometimes little before Eight.—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> has this day begun
							reading the Book of <persRef ref="joshua">Joshua</persRef>. He has
							finished the Pentateuch.— I cannot yet say however that he reads well—
							His progress in writing and cyphering is yet slower— He writes two
							Copies every day with me, and twice a week has a writing Master— He has
							yet scarcely an idea of numeration or of addition— His health is yet
							feeble.</p>
