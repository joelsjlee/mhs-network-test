						<p><date>1. </date>The weather has been so cold since Saturday that I was
							apprehensive the Bridges would have been taken away before <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> could go to school this
							morning— They remained however— I rode with him to school and walked
							home. Had a morning visit from <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Montreal</persRef>— Attended at the
							sale of Books and purchased <persRef ref="duhalde-jean">Du
								Halde’s</persRef> Description of China. On my return home I found
							two Notes— One from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="meyer-jc">Meyer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bruxner-george">Brüxner</persRef>, mentioning that the seeds,
							for <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wolcott</persRef>, had arrived late on Saturday and that they sent
							them down yesterday to Cronstadt—the other was from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, with the draft of a Note which he proposes to
							send to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>,
							informing him that by an American Gazette of 3. Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> it appeared that the U.S. Senate having
							judged the offices of Secretary of the Treasury and of Envoy to a
							foreign Court incompatible with each other, and the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> nevertheless not having
							nominated another person to the Treasury, the Senate had refused to
							confirm the nomination of him as one of the Envoys to this Court. That
							from the character of the Gazette, and the details given in it, he has
							no doubt of its authenticity— That neither of the members of the mission
							had received advices from America of a later date, but that he would not
							continue to exercise functions no longer belonging to him. That no
							inconvenience would result from this Circumstance, the two other members
							of the mission, being authorized by the original appointment to act as
							well without him as with him— He therefore requested the Count to add to
							the civilities with which he had honoured him that of an interview for
							an extra-official Conversation, to make arrangements for the most
							suitable manner for him to ask for his Passports, and take leave— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin requested me by a minute on the
							back of this draft to look over it, and give him freely my opinion of
							the propriety of his sending it.— I soon afterwards received an
							enclosure from <persRef ref="speyer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Speyer</persRef>, with a letter for me from <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes</persRef>;
							two from him to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin and
								<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, and one to M<hi

								<persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> at Paris in cypher— I immediately
							took the letters for my Colleagues to them. After dinner I decyphered
							the letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, which took me
							three hours— <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis</persRef> spent the latter part of the Evening with us— The
							account of the action upon lake Ontario came to England by several
							different ways, but there is yet no official account. The allies in
							Germany continue to be gaining daily advantages and victories over the
							French.— I rose this morning at 4 O’Clock; but by the distribution and
							employment of the day made no progress in my course of Chronology.</p>

							with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norman</persRef>

							gave me the first news of the great victory of the allies over <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> and his army, near
							Leipzig—there had been a rumour of this battle yesterday— The report now
							comes from the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef>—
							Leipzig taken by storm—4 french Marshals, 14 Generals, 36000 men and 450
							pieces of Cannon taken— <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> soon after called
							upon me— At the request of <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>,
							he had applied to <persRef ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bailey</persRef> the English Consul, to ascertain from
								<persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef>, whether he
							had any instruction from his Government relative to the American mission
							Extraordinary— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey called yesterday
							upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, and told him that Lord
							Walpole had informed him that on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							of September, <persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef>
							had delivered to <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode</persRef> at the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Head-Quarters a Memoir from the British
							Government, stating at full length their reasons for declining any
							Mediation in their contest with the United States, and requesting the
							Emperor not to insist upon it any further— That the Emperor after
							perusing this Memoir had said, “en ce cas là, je ne puis plus rien y
							faire”. But that the British Government had offered to treat directly
							with the American Envoys, either at Gothenburg, or in London. When M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris reported this to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard, they thought it advisable that he should apply to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, to know
							if he had received any Communication upon the subject— He had just come
							from the Count, who told him that he had received from <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef> a dispatch in answer
							to the Instructions he had sent him to renew the offer of the Emperor’s
							Mediation— That Count Lieven had not presented to the British Minister
							the Note renewing this offer, which the Chancellor had sent him by the
							Courier dispatched from hence 28 August, because when Count Lieven
							received that dispatch, he had already received from the British
							Government and transmitted to the Emperor the Memoir, formally and
							explicitly rejecting the Mediation.— Count Romanzoff said he should in a
							day or two ask a Conference with us, and communicate this information to
							us. But he had received no orders from the Emperor, nor even any
							information from him of the Memoir transmitted to him directly from
							England— He should now dispatch a Courier to the Emperor, requesting his
							final orders upon the subject. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							observed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard were now embarrassed how to
							proceed— Wishing to avoid any unnecessary delay of their departure, and
							still thinking it unjustifiable to go, without written and official
							information from this Government of the rejection of the Mediation— The
							Count had said nothing to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris of the
							news from the Armies. I called before dinner at the lodgings of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin only was at
							home. I shewed him the letter I had received form <persRef
								ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had sent
							to Count Romanzoff the Note of which he had yesterday shewn me the
							draft—and the Count had appointed this Evening at nine O’Clock to see
							him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thinks that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard ought not to go, untill we have
							from this Government an official and explicit written notification of
							the rejection of the Mediation by the British Government.— He said it
							might be mortifying to the Chancellor and the Emperor to have this
							communication to make; but that they must come to it.— I walked on the
							Quay before dinner— There was much floating ice in the river, and I
							found the Summer Garden Bridge was removed— The <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>ladies</persRef> had seen it standing, not more than an hour
							before— <persRef ref="colombi-maria">Countess Colombi</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bode-frederica">Miss Frederica Bode</persRef> spent

						<p><date>3. </date>I walked this morning on the lower Quay, and found the

							Kazan Church— <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin gave me an account of the
							Conversation he had last Evening with <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>— He informed the Count that it was his
							intention to go, without waiting for any official communication of the
							decision of the U.S. Senate concerning him— The Count told him that he
							could not judge how far this might be congenial to the Constitution of
							the United States, but he thought there was not a Government in Europe,
							from which an Envoy would take such a responsibility upon himself, as to
							withdraw, upon such unauthenticated information, and without formal
							Instructions, from his Court— But if he had concluded upon it, the form
							in which he thought it would be best to apply for audiences to take <pb
								n="34" type="ms"/>leave would be to state that he had received a <hi
								rend="italic">Congé</hi>—to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin objected that it would not be conformable to the fact— The
							Count then said he might state, que des Circonstances majeures, had
							induced him to withdraw; and that he should thereupon obtain the
							necessary Audiences— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gallatin then
							adverted to the situation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, and
							his wish to go with him, if as we now knew the fact to be that Great
							Britain had definitively rejected the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Mediation, we could receive it in such form as
							to warrant his departure— The Count said he was not yet in possession of
							such facts as would justify him in making to us a written communication
							of that rejection— That he intended to ask of us a Conference to-morrow
							to give us all the information he had— He had received two dispatches
							from <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>— The one
							some days ago; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin inferred, about
							ten days ago; but the Count he said was a little shy about giving dates;
							probably from a belief that we might think he ought to have given us
							immediate notice of what he did receive.— This first dispatch
							acknowledged the receipt of Count Romanzoff’s Instruction to renew the
							offer of Mediation; and promised to answer by <persRef
								ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourieff’s</persRef> Courier, who arrived about the same time—and
							would soon return— It being Count Lieven’s intention to dispatch Count
							Romanzoff’s Courier, directly to the Emperor’s Head-Quarters— The second
							dispatch Count Romanzoff received two days ago; and in it Count Lieven
							observed that he had not presented the Note offering the renewal of the
							Mediation, according to his Instructions, because before receiving it
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> had
							communicated him a long and detailed Memoir giving at large, and from
							the expressions used by Count Romanzoff, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin understood that Count Lieven meant to say, in a manner
							satisfactory to him, the reasons why the British Government declined any
							Mediation, to settle their dispute with America; which Memoir had been
							transmitted directly to the Emperor at his Head-Quarters— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said Count Romanzoff appeared to
							be greatly mortified at this conduct of Count Lieven; and that he felt
							it peculiarly as affecting himself— He said he had sent the dispatch
							itself immediately to the Emperor, without any Comment, but requesting
							the Emperor to read it wholly through, and to give him his orders what
							to do upon it— He then observed that the offer of the Mediation had
							originally been the Emperor’s own idea, that he had spoken several times
							to him upon the subject— That when he first gave him the order to make
							the offer, he the Count had hinted to him that England might reluct at a
							Mediation, from a sort of remembrance of their former dominion in
							America, and a disposition to think themselves a sort of elder brother,
							and to consider it as a family quarrel, with which strangers should have
							nothing to do— The Emperor said that was nothing to him— He entertained
							no such idea, and would make the offer— The Count had then asked him, if
							he would not first ascertain whether England would accept the Mediation,
							before he offered it to America— He said no—that would not be fair— He
							must make the offer to both at the same time— The Count further remarked
							that <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> since his
							arrival here, had very bitterly complained of an Article in the
							Conservateur Impartial, concerning the presentation of the American
							Envoys to the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>—not
							on account of that part which was complimentary to America, and the
							Envoys, but because it expressed a hope that this mediation would effect
							a Peace, when in fact it had been rejected by England— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin added that this morning <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							had met Lord Walpole at <persRef ref="bailey-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey’s</persRef>, and Lord Walpole
							had there told him, that before he last left England, which was on the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August, he had a conversation
							with Lord Castlereagh on the subject of this Mediation. Lord Castlereagh
							had told him that the first time he had heard of the Mediation was upon
							the notice of the Passport given by <persRef ref="warren-john2">Admiral
								Warren</persRef> for the vessel that brought the two American
							Envoys— That on this information a Cabinet Council was immediately held
							where it was unanimously determined that the Mediation ought not to be
							accepted; but that the British Government would be willing to treat
							directly with the Envoys, either at Gothenburg or in London. That he,
							Lord Walpole, then went to Prague, where on the 22<hi rend="superscript"
								>d:</hi> of August, <persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord
								Cathcart</persRef> told him that he had informed the Emperor of this
							determination of the British Government, and that the Emperor had
							thereupon said, that such being the case he could do nothing more in the
							business— Lord Walpole went, then to Vienna, and when on his return to
							come here, he was again at the Emperor’s Head-Quarters, Lord Cathcart
							told him, that he had in the interval received new and more particular
							Instructions, to explain to the Emperor the reasons of the British
							Government, for declining the Mediation; that on his speaking of it to
							the Emperor, he had said that it was unnecessary to go into any further
							details, as he had already instructed his Chancellor; to express his
							regret to the American Envoys, that England having declined his
							Mediation he could take no further measure in it— Lord Walpole added
							that he had told all this to Count Romanzoff—that he regretted the
							American Envoys had been so long detained here— That the <pb n="35"
								type="ms"/>contest between England and America was now reduced
							within so narrow a compress, and the disposition to Peace was on both
							sides so strong, that he believed if they could but get to treat, they
							would easily come to terms— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris said
							that we had no authority to treat otherwise than under the Mediation; to
							which Lord Walpole replied, that if we would treat, he was confident the
							British Government would admit our authority such as it is, without
							hesitation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin remarked that there
							were several things in these statements of Lord Walpole, manifestly
							incorrect in point of fact; but altogether he thought the Circumstances
							stated by him, compared with the proceedings of the Emperor and of Count
							Romanzoff, very extraordinary and unaccountable— I told him that Lord
							Walpole had been very free in telling the same story about the
							communication to the Emperor of the British rejection of his Mediation,
							and of what he had said relating to it—that I had heard it from various
							quarters; and it was mentioned to me particularly by <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Montreal</persRef>
							whom I met this morning in the street, and who I suppose had it from the
							English merchant <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							second dispatch, received a few days since, he stated that he had not
							presented the Note renewing the offer, because, in the interval since
							his last dispatch, Lord Castlereagh had confidentially communicated to
							him a long and particular memoir, which had been sent directly to the
							Emperor at his Head-Quarters, proving the utter impossibility that the
							contest between Great-Britain and America should <pb n="36" type="ms"
							/>be settled by any Mediation, and requesting the Emperor not to press
							the subject any farther— The Count said that the Emperor had not given
							him any orders in consequence of this Memoir from England, nor even
							informed him of it— In the midst of the Events which were passing and
							which so fully occupied the Emperor, he might perhaps have forgotten it;
							but he had shewn me the Instruction from the Emperor, in his own
							hand-writing which approved of the Note to renew the offer of Mediation,
							which he had directed Count Lieven to present.— He had now sent Count
							Lieven’s dispatch to the Emperor, and was waiting for his orders
							concerning it— <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> had
							rather insinuated than directly asserted that <persRef
								ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef> had informed the
							Emperor of the refusal of England to treat under a Mediation, and at the
							same time had declared the readiness of the English Government to treat
							directly with the Envoys either at Gothenburg or in London— I told the
							Count that I had heard Lord Walpole had gone further and reported here
							in public companies that the Emperor had told Lord Cathcart he had given
							orders that the American Envoys should be informed that he could proceed
							no further in the business.— The Count asked me to give him my opinion
							what it would be best for America to do, on this proposal from England—
							I said that I could only conjecture what course the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> might adopt— Perhaps he
							might send us new Powers to treat directly— He asked when I thought it
							probable we could receive such new Powers— I supposed not before next
							April—perhaps not before June— He asked if we had not already informed
							our Government of what might probably be the ultimate proposal from
							England to treat directly— I said we had— Possibly the President might
							act immediately upon that information, and give us an eventual new
							authority to treat in case the proposal should be made by England— If so
							we might receive it much sooner— He asked me what was the President’s
							character— Was he a man that made up his mind promptly and with
							decision; or was he more inclined to deliberate and judge slowly— I said
							the President’s character was neither slow nor precipitate— That he took
							his measures with firmness and decision, but not without solid grounds
							to act upon. The Count said he thought if we were overhasty in the
							purpose of concluding this Peace, it would not be permanent— The War
							would be to begin again in six months time— But if we had successes in
							the War, they would be the best of all possible aids to negotiation— He
							then asked about the action upon Lake Ontario, and whether we had any
							account of it— I said, only those in the English Newspapers; which if
							true must give us the command of that Lake. He said he had also seen in
							an English paper, that an American privateer had taken an English vessel
							having dispatches from the <persRef ref="ouseley-gore">English
								Ambassador in Persia</persRef>, to the British Government in India;
							and that they had been published in America— They were said to be
							curious; as containing particulars of the War between Persia and Russia—
							I had not seen them— Returning to the subject of our Negotiation the
							Count said that as the British Parliament were about to assemble, <hi
								rend="italic">les aboyeurs</hi> (the opposition) would of course
							attack the proceedings of the Ministry, and might charge them with
							having slighted this opportunity of making Peace with America— Car il
							etoit echappé a <hi rend="italic">quelqu’un</hi> de dire que je leur
							avoit donné un tort—c’est un reproche qu’ils me sont— This must have
							been Lord Walpole— But the English Opposition will never blame the
							Ministry for rejecting the Russian Mediation.— I spoke also to the Count
							of the anxiety of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin and
								<persRef ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef> to return to the United
							States— He said he thought neither of them could go, untill official and
							positive information should come to them, to warrant their departure. As
							I alluded to the peculiar situation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, the Count said he had been long informed of it, though he had
							thought it best to say nothing to us about it— That <persRef
								ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef> had written him; first, that the President was
							likely to be thwarted (tracassé) about the mission, generally;
							afterwards he had written, that with regard to the mission there would
							be no difficulty; but that upon the appointment of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin there would— I mentioned to him
							the forms of our Constitution which had occasioned this state of things,
							and observed that it had been decided in the Senate by a majority of
							only one vote— He asked if the Senate could not reconsider, their
							decision— I said they were not in Session. But at their next meeting,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin might be nominated again— He
							said, that at all Events, he thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin could not go away without official communication from his
							Government of the Event.— After leaving the Count, I went for a few
							minutes to the sale— Dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>18. </date>I was confined to the house by the weather, expecting an

							discovered a new particular of my own ignorance of things which I ought
							to have known these thirty years— One clear Morning about a fortnight

							forming a Constellation which I had not before observed and of which I

							and I saw him rise from the roof of the house on the other side of the

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							<persRef ref="gallatin-james">son</persRef> brought me a draft of a
							letter to the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>
							written by <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bayard</persRef>, for a dispatch from the Mission— It contained a

							intentions of the British Government, a statement of the course which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Bayard, propose to take in returning home; and particularly
							that they have it in contemplation to stop in England, to ascertain the
							views of the British Government in relation to Peace. I wrote, what I
							thought a very material addition to this draft, stating what we actually
							know of the British Government’s views in relation to Peace— They seemed
							to me very clearly and explicitly unfolded in <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring’s</persRef> letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, and I thought there was no sufficient motive to omit all
							notice of them in the dispatch— I took this addition to them, but found
							an insuperable reluctance in them to inserting it in the dispatch. They
							thought it would be sufficient to send to the Secretary of State a copy
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring’s letter— That letter urges the
							Mission to go to England, to treat directly with the British Ministers;
							but says in the most decisive terms that the British will agree to no
							Article abandoning the practice of impressment— The Mission has no
							powers to treat with the British government, but under the Russian
							Mediation; and is most pointedly instructed to sign no Treaty without a
							stipulation that the practice of impressment shall be abandoned— I told
							my Colleagues that the motive of ascertaining whether the British
							Government persevered in their principles, and also what they proposed
							as expedients to guard against the abuse as they called it, of
							impressment, was sufficient in my mind to justify their touching in
							England, and they were to judge for themselves, as to the responsibility
							which they assumed by it in regard to our Government— I thought that
							responsibility not inconsiderable, as without any powers to treat
							at-all, they were going to treat with a full knowledge that it must be
							upon a basis, directly in the face of our Instructions. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that the whole of that
							responsibility must rest upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard;
							that <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, Gallatin, was no longer a member of the
							mission; he was a private Gentleman, and might go home by the way of
							England, or any other way as he pleased. That as to the approbation of
							the Government, he should not trouble himself about it— He would not
							disobey their orders; but if he was right he should not much regard
							whether they liked it or not. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring’s
							letter did indeed speak of the decision of the British Government upon
							the point of impressment in the clearest <pb n="40" type="ms"/>and
							strongest terms, but he believed the point might still be presented to
							them in a manner which would induce them to judge of it otherwise— This
							he thought would be the utility of their going to England— For his
							purpose was to convince the British Ministers that unless they should
							yield on the Article of Impressment, there was no possibility of
							treating at all. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayards ideas were
							altogether different— He thought they could not only treat with the
							British Ministry, but even settle all the principles and Articles of a
							Treaty— He appeared perfectly prepared to concede the point of
							impressment, and said the British had professed a readiness to modify
							it, entirely to our satisfaction— He was for making <hi rend="italic"
								>distinctions</hi>—for conceding the right of search without
							admitting it for the purpose of impressment— On the article of
							responsibility he saw no difference between his situation and that of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin. From the moment their
							mission to this Court terminated they would both be private men, and
							neither would be more responsible for his subsequent acts than the
							other. I observed there was a material difference in their situations
							inasmuch as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin quoad this mission
							was no longer in the public service, which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard was and would be, untill his return to the United
							States— Finding however that they were both averse to my proposed
							addition, to the dispatch, I remarked that it would be necessary to make
							some change in the paragraph of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayards
							draft stating their intention of stopping in England— For without
							hinting at the invitation to the mission, or at the hint given by
								<persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> that the
							British Ministers would ask no questions about powers, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard simply said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard, had it in contemplation to stop in England, with a
							view to ascertain the intentions of the British Government in relation
							to Peace— I said I thought those intentions very fully and unequivocally
							stated in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring’s letter— And they
							offered as the only basis upon which they would treat a principle to
							which we were most pointedly forbidden by our Instructions to accede— If
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin thought he could perswade
							the British Government to relax from their obstinacy, or M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard thought he could settle a Treaty
							with them that would be satisfactory to our Country, it was a
							justifiable motive for them to go to England, but it could hardly be
							said they were going to ascertain the intentions of the British Ministry
							in relation to Peace— These we knew already, perfectly well, and by
							omitting all notice of the invitation in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baring’s letter, and of the avowal of the only principle upon which his
							Government will treat; we had the appearance of suppressing, what I
							thought by far the most important part of the Communication due from us
							to our Government. Both the Gentlemen agreed that the communication must
							undoubtedly be made— The only question was, in what form? They thought
							it sufficient to enclose to the Secretary of State a copy of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Baring’s letter, and merely refer to it
							in the dispatch; adding that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard contemplated stopping in
							England, on their way home— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							proposed even to make this a separate dispatch, or rather a private
							letter; and to say nothing at all in the dispatch about their intention
							to go to England, which after all he said it was quite uncertain whether
							they should or not— Perhaps they should finally conclude to go North
							about— He added that unless the British Government were sincere in the
							wish for Peace, this proposal for a direct Negotiation was insidious,
							and they had connected it with the avowal of their basis, with the
							intention of having it rejected, and thereby throwing back upon the
							American Government the odium of refusing Peace, which otherwise, by
							their rejection of the Mediation would fall upon them.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard seemed anxious to discuss the
							expediency of giving up the point of impressment— He said half the
							American Nation were for giving it up— The State of Massachusetts had
							called upon the Government explicitly to give it up— I told him I
							thought it would be time enough to consider this question when our
							Instructions should authorize us to give it up. In the mean time, it was
							proper for our Government to know, that the British will not negotiate
							on any other principle— Our Government must decide for themselves— I did
							not know how high-spirited they would feel at this juncture; but I well
							knew that half the Nation; not the half that he spoke of, but the other;
							the half which approved the War, would never approve or be satisfied
							with a Peace which should give up the point of impressment— After much
							conversation on these topics I took back with me the sketch of our
							Addition to the dispatch, which they did not approve, and left M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard’s draft to be modified as they
							shall think proper.— Received a Notification from the <persRef

								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							came— That this did really embarrass them; as it was a very unpleasant
							thing for them to reject the Mediation— That having found it however
							absolutely necessary, they had immediately given notice of their
							determination to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>— That
							he had received this notice first verbally at Bautzen— That it had been
							repeated in writing on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of July, and
							afterwards by an official Note dated 13 July and sent to <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef>; of which he Lord
							Walpole had among his papers a copy.— He spoke of it in a style of
							complaint, and said that Russia might have had the civility to make the
							offer of Mediation to both parties at once; or at least to have given
							the British Government <hi rend="italic">notice</hi>, of the offer to
							America— I had heard before that Lord Walpole had said the British
							Government had not been informed of the offer of Russia to mediate
							untill last Summer, which appeared extraordinary, and now hearing him
							say so expressly, to be sure of not mistaking his meaning, I asked him
							if I had understood it correctly— He said I had—repeated over again what
							he had said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, adding that they
							were the last words Castlereagh said to him when he left England.— Lord
							Walpole has an apparent frankness, and some coarseness in his manners—
							He said they kept Michaelmas in England the 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> of September— That it was an universal and indispensible
							custom to dine upon goose— That it was called goose-day— That members of
							Parliament always dined that day with their Constituents— He dined with
							the <persRef ref="swatman-william">Mayor</persRef> of the place he
							represented— The Constituents gave very good dinners—and we do not get
							drunk, but something devilish near it.— He told me that he had been two
							or three years in the Admiralty— That the Admiralty cost twenty Millions
							a year— That he and the other members proposed in 1811 to reduce it two
							Millions, but the first Lord would not consent, and his voice weighed
							more than all the others put together— He said that <persRef
								ref="vansittart-nicholas">Vansittart</persRef> was a devilish fine
							fellow. That <persRef ref="pitt-william2">Pitt</persRef> had undoubtedly
							been one of the first men in the world for finance; but Vansittart who
							had been only a Secretary of the Treasury under him was a much bolder
							man, and had done things from which Pitt recoiled with horror— He and
								<persRef ref="addington-henry2">Sidmouth</persRef> after the Peace
							at Amiens, by one dash had raised in one year of Peace the supplies to
							pay off all the floating debt—a measure which struck Pitt with horror;
							but in which Vansittart had been perfectly successful— This year, he was
							taking part of his supplies from the sinking fund, which some thought

							<persRef ref="herodotus">Herodotus</persRef> the same assertion, and

								ref="xerxes">Xerxes</persRef>, and that he reigned after <persRef
								ref="darius-i">Darius</persRef> for proof of which he refers to Ezra
							ch VII. and to Nehemiah— But the Count has not solved the difficulty— It
							is evident that the Ahasuerus and Artahashashta of Ezra IV.6 and 7.
							reigned before Darius—v. 24 is express to that point—and it appears <pb
								n="42" type="ms"/>equally clear that the Artaxerxes of Ezra VII. and
							of Nehemiah, reigned after all the others— It is agreed on all sides
							that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was Artaxerxes Longimanus.— My French
							Bible says also that the Ahasuerus of Esther is believed to have been
							Darius the son of <persRef ref="hystaspes">Histaspes</persRef>— But this
							same Ahasuerus, in the Greek Apocryphal remnant of the book of Esther is
							called Artaxerxes. The whole narrative in Ezra and Nehemiah is intricate
							and perplexed— The first return from the captivity, under <persRef
								ref="zorobabel">Zorobabel</persRef>, the second under Ezra, and the
							third under Nehemiah are so blended together that I am unable to arrange
							them in distinct order— Ezra seems to relate Events as having happened
							at one time, which Nehemiah tells as having occurred at another.— The
							confusion, discordancies, and errors of dates, numbers and names
							throughout the Bible is greater than I had ever imagined.— I
							accidentally met the remark in <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> the

								Matthew’s</persRef> genealogy of Christ omits three
								generations—<persRef ref="ahaziah">Ahaziah</persRef>—<persRef

							are called the third and fourth— They are not admitted even in the Roman

						<p><date>28. </date>Read Prayers—for the first Sunday
							in Advent; and having gone through the Morning service of the whole year
							we began and purpose to continue this year with the Evening service. I
							read <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> paraphrase of
							the 7<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Psalm, and two Sermons—one upon the
							death of the Sinner, and the Death of the Righteous; and the other on
							the last Judgment— This last was preached the first Sunday in Advent.
							There is perhaps too much resemblance between the arrangement and the
							argument of these two discourses— I found my mind more impressed by the
							first, than by the second.— The contrasted pictures of the Sinner and of
							the righteous man at the hour of death is affecting; and may it have
							suitably affected me!— There is a peculiarity in Massillon’s style of
							composition which he uses too often— He quotes a text of Scripture, in
							Latin, according to the practice of all the Roman Catholic preachers;
							paraphrases and dilates upon it sometimes for two or three pages;
							closing every paragraph, by repeating the Latin text— In the Sermon upon
							Death, he applies in this manner a part of the Catholic Church Service
							for the dying Proficiscere Anima Christiana, with great energy and
							beauty— But in that on the Judgment, he sports too long with Scrutabor
							Jerusalem in lucernis— Congregabo super te omnes amatores tuos—et
							videbunt omnem turpitudinem tuam. There are scarcely any of his Sermons
							in which he does not thus hammer out a text with iteration and
							reiteration, untill it sometimes hazards the very appearance of his
							being serious— His paraphrases of the Psalms are very inferior to his
							other works— Besides the mystical sense in which he frequently
							misapplies his text, his prayers are too argumentative— In that of the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Psalm he seems inclined to discuss
							with the Deity which of two alternatives would be most for his own
							glory— The prayer of the righteous availeth much; and prayer implies in
							itself that the divine purposes are susceptible of change, from its
							influence— But of what the divine glory consists, it becomes not mortals
							in addressing the deity to question.— I was this day quite unwell—
