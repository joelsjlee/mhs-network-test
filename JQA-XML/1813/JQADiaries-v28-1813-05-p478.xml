								<persRef ref="malthus-thomas">Malthus</persRef>. His observations

								>Godwin</persRef>, to their uttermost foundations. His style is

							grave, candid, moderate, and remarkable for its urbanity— He treats
							Godwin, and the memory of Condorcet with great gentleness, and keeps his
							temper always cool in a discussion, upon which others have been too apt
							to indulge their Passions— There is one instance of ridicule pointed at
							Condorcet, in the allusion to the crossing of the Bickerstaff breed, and
							several home thrusts in the reply to Godwin; but he handles them both as
							the <persRef ref="kingofbrobdingnag">king of Brobdignag</persRef>
							handled <persRef ref="lemuelgulliver">Captain Gulliver</persRef>— He has
							such a crushing power of argument over them that they can give him no
							occasion for emotion of temper—the Chapter on Emigration and that on the
							Poor Laws are highly important, and expose the erroneous policy of all
							the European Governments on these subjects— His deductions are so
							obvious and so irresistible, that it is astonishing they had so long
							escaped the attention of political writers, and of Statesmen.</p>

								<persRef ref="malthus-thomas">Malthus</persRef>, making the
							application of his arguments and facts— The Chapter upon Moral Restraint
							considers celibacy as one of the most important of human virtues—
							Meaning celibacy with a strict observance of chastity, and so far as it
							is dictated by the inability to support a family.— His fundamental
							position that the natural increase of population is in a geometrical
							ratio, while the increase of food can only be in arithmetical
							proportion, is apparently incontrovertible— Many of his inferences are
							far from pleasing in contemplation, but I know not how to escape from
							them— It seems indeed that there are inferences, which he chooses
							himself to keep out of sight. For Countries fully peopled, War can have
							not the slightest tendency to diminish the population; and monastic
							institutions, devoted to the improvement of Agriculture must be wise,
							humane, and patriotic.— <persRef ref="beresford-benjamin">D<hi

							There has been no official publication of military events, since the

							observed since that time has occasioned some disappointment and
							uneasiness in the public mind— Vague and groundless reports of defeat
							and disaster have been whispered about, and other reports of success and
							victory have been spread abroad to counteract them. M<hi

							After dinner the Curate of the Catholic Church <persRef

							come here— Paul answered him <pb n="485" type="ms"/>that he perfectly
							recollected their acquaintance at Quimper-Corentin, and invited him
							immediately to come here; which he accordingly did— He was presented to
							Paul, who asked him what he could do for him— He was advised by some of
							his friends to ask for lands, and peasants, or a pension; but this he
							declined— He said that in France he had been a Curate, and his wish was
							to exercise the same profession here— Immediately upon which Paul issued
							an Ukase appointing him Curate of the Catholic Church— Six Months after,
							Paul gave the Church to the Jesuits—since which time he had lived there
							with them, though he was not himself a Jesuit, but a secular Priest— I
							told him I was acquainted with the <persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz"

							repeated his hopes that the Sieur Bonaparte would certainly be put down,
