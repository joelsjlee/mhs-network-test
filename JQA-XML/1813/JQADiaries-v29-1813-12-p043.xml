							attempt reading, and at 9 I finished the Evening.— Refraction and
							Parallax are dry studies— They require occasional <pb n="44" type="ms"
							/>intervals of remission to my attention— So I looked into <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> Henry 4. Act 2.
							Scene 1. where the Carrier concludes that it is “four by the day,
							because Charles’ wain is over the new Chimney”— The time of this scene
							must have been in winter, and the usage of the Common Carrier’s of that
							time to judge of the time of the Night by the position of the Great
							Bear. I looked also in <persRef ref="plinytheelder">Pliny</persRef> for
							the references to Epigenes, so differently cited by <persRef
								ref="goguet-antony">Goguet</persRef> and Schubert.— The difference
							is between 720, and 720,000.— <persRef ref="poinsinet-louis"
								>Poinsinet</persRef> gives in the text and translates it 720. but he
							says in a note that it should be 720,000—so that the question remains

						<p><date>2. </date>Half past five. The incidents of the day are so like the
							general tenor of my time, that they need not be noticed— <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							spent the Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>— The remainder of the day I was engaged in reading—
							Finished the Book of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>— I believe this to
							be a moral tale—a fictitious history; nor do I perceive any article of
							faith, necessarily depending upon its reality.— The Book is supposed to
							have been written by <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>; which may
							very possibly be true; but its whole tenor—narrative—dialogue—and
							personages has to me the appearance of a story adapted to a doctrine,
							and not of a doctrine resulting from a Story.— The appearance of Satan,
							among the sons of God, before the Lord in the first Chapter, and the
							Conversation between the Lord and him, has not the air of History— The
							four Messengers who come to Job, to announce his disasters in one
							identical form of words— The three friends who come to comfort him, and
							sit down with him seven days and seven Nights without speaking a word—
							The incidents at the conclusion of the story; every incident, as well as
							every discourse betokens the work of the Imagination, and not the record
							of facts— The doctrine which they teach is the purest and sublimest
							morality— The question which they discuss the most difficult in the
							whole compass of moral philosophy.— Job, the perfect and upright man, is
							permitted by the divine will to be visited with the severest
							afflictions, to be plunged in an instant from the summit of prosperity
							to the lowest depth of wretchedness, as a trial of his integrity—
								<persRef ref="sitidos">His wife</persRef> advises him to renounce
							it, which he indignantly refuses— His friends, infer from his
							misfortunes, that he is punished for his iniquities—or that he complains
							unjustly for sufferings which arise merely from the lot of humanity.— He
							vindicates his own integrity; but he dwells too confidently upon it— He
							complains that there is no destruction of Heavenly favour to reward him
							for it— That God destroyeth the perfect, and the wicked— He is righteous
							in his own eyes— <persRef ref="elihu">Elihu</persRef> first blames Job,
							for justifying himself rather than God—and he blames his friends, for
							condemming him without proof— At last the Lord, out of the whirl wind,
							confounds the reasoning of Job, by recalling to his mind, his impotence,
							even to conceive the purposes, and the infinite extent of the divine
							power— Job is instantly convinced of his error, and repents with the
							deepest humility— He is restored to the divine favour; and his friends
							are commanded to atone for their uncharitable sentiments concerning him,
							by sacrifices.— The moral doctrines taught by this Story are,—1. The
							omnipotence and the Justice of the divine Government. 2. That the
							afflictions of the righteous, are trials of their Integrity. 3. The
							frailty and infirmity of man. and 4. The duties of resignation to God’s
							will, and of humility under affliction— These are all Hebrew doctrines—
							They are in no antient system of mythology, and in none of the
							philosophical systems of the Greeks— They are inculcated with great
							ingenuity and energy; and the story is framed to present them in their
							greatest possible force— I lament being unable to read this Book in the
							original— All the translations are defective, and the English one
							particularly and greatly incorrect— Many passages present to my mind no
							distinct sense—many such disjointed and incoherent ideas, as could never
							be put together by a man of genius like the author of Job. Sentences,
							one half of which have no apparent relation to the other— Violent and
							unnatural transitions of thought; and obscurities which it is vain to
							attempt bringing to light.— There is scarcely any difference between the
							discourses of the three friends, in point of substance— Their phrases
							and imagery are varied; but they all dwell upon the same leading ideas—
							There is nothing but the names, to discriminate the one from the other—
							There is no individuality among them, as there is in all the historical
							personages of the Bible: and this is one of the reasons upon which I
							believe the narrative fictitious— Compare it with the Stories of
								<persRef ref="ruth">Ruth</persRef>, or of <persRef ref="esther"
								>Esther</persRef>—with those of any of the Patriarchs, Judges,
							Kings, or Prophets, and how clearly you see the difference between a
							portrait from the life, and a fancy-piece!— Job is a philosophical
							Romance, full of profound and admirable instruction; nor do I suppose it
							more necessary to believe it a history of facts, than to believe the
							Parables of the prodigal son, or of the good Samaritan to have been so.—
							I also read this day in <persRef ref="schubert-friedrich"
								>Schubert’s</persRef> Astronomy, on the size and figure of the
							Earth, and its daily and annual Revolutions.— He explains very fully the
							modern method of measuring a degree of the meridian, and refers to
								<persRef ref="bradley-james">Bradley’s</persRef> discoveries of
							Nutation and aberration; while he was seeking the yearly parallax of the
							fixed Stars.</p>

							hours,—I walked round by the lower Admiralty before Breakfast— And I
							walked again before dinner— <persRef ref="todd-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> spent about an hour of
							the Evening here— I proceeded in the perusal of <persRef
								ref="schubert-friedrich">Schubert’s</persRef> Popular Astronomy; and
							read the Chapter concerning the movements of the fixed Stars. The
							Copernican system has been so corroborated by the discoveries of later
							Astronomers that it has almost become a heresy to recollect that it is
							still only a system— A theory, devised by man to account for the
							appearances in the Heavens. I am not appalled either by the distances or
							by the multitudes of the fixed stars which this system and the
							observations of the improved Telescope present to the mind; for space is
							infinite, and however great the multitude of worlds may be, he who
							created and governs, can number them though I cannot.— But as the whole
							system of <persRef ref="copernicus-nicolaus">Copernicus</persRef> is
							founded on the fundamental axiom that every appearance to us of the
							Heavenly Bodies is a combination of optical delusions, the question
							occurs, whether, there may not be yet other optical delusions, not yet
							detected, but which if discovered would produce a totally new and
							different theory of Astronomy. The objection to the Copernican system
							that it implies a great waste of unoccupied space between our solar
							system and the nearest fixed Star, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Schubert does not satisfactorily answer— His conjecture that there are
								<hi rend="italic">millions</hi> of Planets and Comets revolving
							round our Sun is mere guess-work not supported by any observation— That
							the Planets and Comets may be more than we know is highly probable; but
							that there are many more, I see no reason for believing. The inference
							from the flattening of the Globe at the Poles it was once a fluid is
							also mere conjecture, and the argument in support of it weak— There is a
							part of this Book which for want of proper Mathematical knowledge, I do
							not understand.</p>

							could not shake off the persecuting Spirit of his Church.— <persRef

							and Venus nearly in conjunction, and the sky was as clear as I ever saw
							it here— But while I was looking to trace some of the Constellations by

							directions, the usual veil of vapours arose and in ten minutes time
							overspread the horizon— There was nothing further to be seen— The last

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I have marked during the course of this Month
							my rising hour every Morning, and it has varied from three to half-past
							eight— This has been on my part involuntary, my wish being to rise
							regularly at five. By some constitutional infirmity, I am habitually so
							much overpowered by drowsiness from the moment of rising from dinner
							that I am utterly disqualified for any useful occupation, and at the
							same time subject to waking at almost every hour of the Night, and from
							the moment of waking equally unable to sleep again; and so restless that
							I am compelled to rise from bed— My efforts to conquer these
							propensities have now been more than two years continued and are still
							ineffectual.— The distribution of my time is in general the same that it
							has been these two years, but during this Month I have read more and
							written less than for some preceding time— My attention having been
							turned to Mathematical Sciences I have read <persRef
								ref="schubert-friedrich">Schubert</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lalande-jerome">La Lande’s</persRef> Abridgment, and began upon
								<persRef ref="biot-jean">Biot</persRef>—also <persRef
								ref="lacroix-sylvestre">La Croix’s</persRef> Arithmetic, and part of
							his Algebra. My attempts to acquire some knowledge by observation of the
							topography of the skies have been constantly baffled by the nature of
							the atmosphere in this climate and Season, as well as by the want of
							instruments and Charts— I hope however by persevering attention to make
							better progress in observation hereafter.</p>
						<p>At the close of another year, I renew to the Supreme Creator of the
							world, my offering of thanksgiving for the blessings which his
							Providence has dispensed from the time when he gave me being, and
							particularly for those of the expiring year—my offering of resignation
							to the afflictive dispensations with which he has been pleased to visit
							me and my family, and especially in the decease of my beloved and only
								<persRef ref="smith-abigail">Sister</persRef>—and my offering of
							humble and fervent prayer for his gracious goodness in future to my
								<persRef ref="adams-john;adams-abigail">aged Parents</persRef>, to
							my <persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2;adams-george">infant
