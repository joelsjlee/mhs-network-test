						<p><date>1. </date>There was this morning an eclipse of the Sun—5 1/2
							digits— Began at half past nine, and finished just at Noon— The sky
							above the City vapours was clear, but the smoke from the chimnies formed
							such a continual Cloud that the eclipse could be but very indistinctly
							seen. The severity of the cold scarcely abated at-all. I wrote a note to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, asking
							a Passport for <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawler</persRef>, and at the same time requesting an interview with
							the Count— He appointed me this Evening at nine O’Clock— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawler came and told me he should not be
							ready to go sooner than Wednesday— I walked before dinner, and wrote as
							much in the course of the day as I was able— At nine in the Evening I
							went to Count Romanzoff’s, and had with him the conversation I had
							requested— My object was to ascertain whether any commercial
							arrangements were making between this Country, which might effect the
							trade between Russia and the United States— Chiefly upon suggestions in
							a letter I have received from <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard</persRef>. I mentioned to the
							Count the present state of our affairs with England. The failure of all
							the attempts to negotiate for a suspension of hostilities; and the
							prospect that the War must continue at least through the greatest part
							of the ensuing Summer, even if the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Mediation should eventually succeed in
							accomplishing a Peace— Under these Circumstances I had been questioned
							in behalf of persons interested in the commerce between Russia and the
							United States, whether there had been or was likely to be any
							Understanding between Russia, and Great-Britain, particularly with
							regard to the subject of articles of Contraband— The Count said there
							neither had been nor was likely to be any such Understanding— That with
								<pb n="450" type="ms"/>England, Russia had simply made Peace, and
							the Events of the French War, had since so entirely absorbed their
							attention, that they had not yet had time to talk about commerce— That
							with regard to articles of Contraband, [“]you know,[”] said he [“]that
							our religion here is different from that of the English— But there have
							been a great many faults committed in Europe— Such is the pressure of
							the most important interests, that it is impossible to have more than
							one Ally— There is but one power on each side— If questions about
							articles of Contraband arise in England we shall adhere to our own
							system and make our claims accordingly— But they will probably adhere to
							their side too— There is no list of contraband adjusted between us; nor
							will they perhaps consider themselves bound by that stipulated in our
							Treaty of Commerce with them, to which the subsequent War with them has
							put an end— They may recur to their most comprehensive list of
							contraband, and at this time we can hardly think of contesting with them
							on that point”— I said that in regard to the interest of Russia in her
							trade with America, almost all her articles of export, Hemp, Sail-Cloth,
							and even Iron, were Articles which the English styled contraband— But my
							business only was to know the fact as he had candidly stated it to me,
							and I should with his permission make it known to those who had
							consulted me concerning it, and they must arrange their commercial
							speculation accordingly— He said, that without naming him I might give
							this as the real state of things, from the best information I could
							collect— That there was no <hi rend="italic">caution valide</hi>, that
							the English would recognize or respect any list of contraband other than
							that which they always allowed— That with respect to commerce, no change
							had yet been made in the Tariff of the last two years— Probably little
							or none would be made— The Tarriff had indeed not yet been renewed; but
							it would be decided upon, within another fortnight, for he knew the
							Emperor had again been applied to for his decision. He himself knew of
							it no more than what was current about the Town—for he attended none of
							the meetings of the Council— When he went away with the Emperor last
							Spring; all his Presidencies (in the Council) had been transferred to
								<persRef ref="saltykov-nikolai">Marshal Soltykoff</persRef>— He
							still retains them—and I, added the Count, being still in the condition
							of a Man for whom the Emperor may send from day to day the order to join
							him, though I do not know whether he will; yet in the mean time I cannot
							attend at the meetings of the Council; appearing under the Presidency of
							Marshal Soltykoff, my equal in rank; but over whom my previous situation
							in the Council had given me precedency— He then asked me some questions
							with regard to the popularity of the War between the United States and
							Britain, as well in England as in America— I said that in America the
							War was popular in some parts of the Country, and unpopular in others— I
							told him what I had heard concerning the probable issue of the
							Presidential election, and my belief that <persRef ref="madison-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> would be
							re-elected— He said that his information led to the same expectation— As
							to the popularity of the War in England I said I was afraid it would be
							too popular with all parties— The only point upon which the war now was
							continued was that of the impressment of our Sailors— On this point the
							whole English Nation, or at least all the political parties were
							unreasonable and the loss of two of their frigates successively,
							captured by American frigates had mortified their national pride, and
							touched their point of honour, in its tenderest part— I was afraid it
							had embittered them, and would make them think they must now fight not
							only for their honour but for revenge— He asked me what I thought of the
							War by Land— I answered that I expected for the present little or
							nothing from it— We were all too raw and unskilled in War to make much
							progress in Canada— He asked if the People of that Province itself were
							not inclined to favour our Cause, and to join the American Union?— I
							answered there might be some of them so disposed, but I placed no
							reliance upon it— He asked whether I thought there was any disposition
							in the present British Ministry towards a General Peace, and noticed a
							remark said to have been made by <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> in Parliament; that the successes of Russia
							had among other good results that of making it possible to conclude a
							Peace— I said that observation had been afterwards explained in a
							Ministerial Paper, not to mean Peace with the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— But the English
							Ministry appeared to think that the late Events had rendered the
							restoration of the throne of France to the family of Bourbon probable;
							in which case they suppose Peace may be made without difficulty— The
							Count said he had not seen this explanation; but he believed this Winter
							would produce events of the highest importance and the most
							extraordinary nature, arising from the late occurrences of the War— But
							it was impossible to foresee precisely what they would be— It was a
							Chaos, as he had told the Emperor, and no one could yet imagine what
							system of order would finally arise from it.— But what did I think of
							the strength of the British Ministry at present?—and what the likelihood
							of any change in it?— I thought the Ministry incomparably stronger than
							they were when ultimately formed last Summer— But would not the English
							Nation be urgent for Peace?— The English Nation <pb n="451" type="ms"
							/>would never ask for Peace, so long as their Ministers could fire the
							Park and Tower Guns, and talk to them of victories over the French;
							whether they were their own or those of their allies— As to a change of
							Ministers I saw no probability of that— The old opposition had not the
							most distant prospect of coming in—the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur;wellesley-henry;wellesley-richard">Wellesley
								family</persRef> little more— <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> probably might come
							in, but the only change of system that could produce would be an
							increase of rancour in the War with America— But why did I think the
							prospects of the Wellesley’s so bad?— There was some delicacy in
							mentioning part of my reasons for this opinion, but I hoped he would
							consider me as speaking altogether in Confidence to him of it— The
							private character of the Marquis of Wellesley was disreputable in
							England— His conduct on the Catholic question was unpopular— The bigoted
							Church-party thought he favoured the Catholics too much, and the
							Catholic party had no confidence in his sincerity.— His political system
							was in no better favour with the public— He was for doubling and
							redoubling all the efforts and sacrifices of the English in Spain— It
							was evident enough that this system was adapted to his brother’s glory,
							and his own family aggrandizement, but the People were not of the same
							opinion, and had not the same motives. They thought the English were
							doing quite enough in Spain; particularly in the expenditure of money;
							which the Nation felt more severely than their losses of men— The Count
							observed that since <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven’s</persRef> arrival in England he had yet received from him
							only one or two despatches; and they mentioned that he should soon
							afterwards speak of American affairs— He spoke of the blockade by the
							English of Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware river, which I told him was
							another illegal blockade; for which I could perceive no other motive
							than a small malice against the Cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore— If
							they expected any good effects to themselves from this measure I trusted
							they would be disappointed— There was another thing in which I had seen
							a symptom of petty malice against America— They had made up a story that
							our <persRef ref="barlow-joel">Minister in France</persRef> had followed
							the Emperor Napoleon to Moscow, to make a Treaty with him against Spain;
							which was certainly a falsehood— The Count said it was true that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow, with the Danish Minister and a
							third diplomatic character from a state supposed to be in the interest
							of France, had been sent for to Willna; by an invitation from the
								<persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke of Bassano</persRef>— But that only
							one of them had arrived there; and that after Napoleon had left it—
							There had been even some dispositions made as if a stay of sometime in
							Lithuania had been contemplated— But the issue of the War had given a
							different turn to things— I said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barlow for aught I knew might have been sent for to Willna—but assuredly
							he never could go there for the object alledged by the English
							Newspapers, and by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning in Parliament.
							As to the Emperor Napoleon, his campaign had terminated in
							disappointment; and placed him in a situation which I considered as
							extremely precarious— But he had nobody to thank for it but himself— He
							was one more example of a head turned by Prosperous Fortune, and he must
							abide by the consequences of his insanity— True it is said the Count,
							that he must thank himself for his present condition— How many—many
							times have I urged upon the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de
								Vicence</persRef>, sitting on this very Canapé, the preservation of
							Peace!— I did not repeat the same to <persRef ref="law-jacques">Count
								Lauriston</persRef>; because although I had every reason to be
							satisfied with his conduct personally to me, I was not upon the same
							terms of intimacy with him as I had been with his predecessor. The Duke
							de Vicence himself, I believe was of the same opinion— His inclinations
							were pacific; but they were unavailing— He was in a sort of disgrace;
							but he seems now to have come into favour again, and was the only person
							who accompanied Napoleon in his late return to Paris— I said I had heard
							that Count Lauriston was dead— There was such a report he answered— That
							he had been found frozen to death in his Carriage; and it was not
							improbable; as no mention was made of him among the Generals and
							Ministers who followed Napoleon upon his return to Paris.— It was
							probable too that Lauriston’s death might be hastened by chagrin at the
							idea of having contributed by his Counsels to the ruin of the army— For
							it is said to have been by his advice, against the opinion of
							Caulaincourt and of all the other Generals, qu’il fit la sottise de
							Moscou— It was Napoleon’s own opinion—and Lauriston flattered him by
							concurring with it— Not from base motives, but because it was his real
							opinion—that by pushing on to Moscow, we should be induced to
							negotiate—and if terms of Peace not too severe should be offered us, we
							should accept them— It was now scarcely credible how complete the
							destruction of that immense army had been— And they could no longer
							disguise it— He had seen a letter from the Duke of Bassano, written at
							Berlin, to some of the French agents in which were these identical
							words— “Il faut avouer que les Circonstances ne nous sont pas
							favorables.” <pb n="452" type="ms"/>I observed that this was by no means
							disclosing a secret— The Count replied that it was not— But that it
							shewed that their acknowledgment of the fact became every day more
							complete— The details surpassed every thing that imagination could have
							anticipated. It was remarkable that at Dresden, the very spot which
							Napoleon had chosen for his point of departure, where in May last he had
							made such a pompous and ridiculous display of power—where he had
							assembled Emperors and kings, and distributed their seats at the
								<persRef ref="frederickaugustus-i">Elector’s</persRef> table, and
							published them in all his Gazettes as if he had been there a monarch
							surrounded by his vassals—that exactly there on his return, he entered
							the City, in a single sledge; without servants; without guards— His very
							Mammeluke had been frozen to death; and he was obliged to borrow four
							thousand Louis of the Elector, to continue his journey, and six shirts
							from his Minister.— At Weimar, he had passed through without stopping,
							and left an apology behind to the Duke for not having visited him—that
							he was absolutely not in a <hi rend="italic">presentable</hi> condition—
							(N.B. the <persRef ref="mariapavlovna">Duchess of Weimar</persRef> is a
							Russian Grand-Duchess— Sister of the Emperor Alexander—) at Weimar; he
							could not go any further in his sledge—which was broken— But borrowed
							the town-carriage of <persRef ref="desaintaignan-auguste">Monsieur de
								Saint-Aignan</persRef>, his Minister, the brother-in-Law of the Duke
							de Vicence, and who was some time here with him; and with this Carriage,
							and two soldiers lent him by the Elector of Saxony he reached Paris— It
							was truly singular that Saxony should have been the particular scene of
							these humiliations—that very Saxony where he had made such a display of
							the Colonies of farmers and Artists, and God knows what, that he had
							brought with his army to settle in Poland.— Since his arrival in Paris,
							it was said he was sick—that he was certainly gone to Marli; on the
							pretext of hunting; and there he might be sick, and confine himself to
							the Palace, without so much notice as it would occasion at Paris— There
							was also a Report current about the City, and related with so many
							circumstances of detail as rendered it highly probable, that there had
							been a great popular Insurrection at Munich in Bavaria— But I have had,
							said the Count, no official advice of it myself— For the Emperor has
							naturally directed the Courier’s who had despatches to me, to proceed to
							his own Head-Quarters, and has opened the packets addressed to me— Thus
							far my Conversation with the Count; of which as of all the others I have
							with him I give the most particular relation, omitting only the common
							chat about weather, my family, and objects of no general or particular
							interest, which are occasionally mingled with them— The Circumstances
							which most struck me this time were those which the Count mentioned
							respecting himself—and which seemed to indicate an apprehension of
							declining favour— It was near eleven at Night when I came home— Still
							bitter cold— Thermometer Morn -23:8 Noon -20:7, Eve -22:7.</p>

							almost a calm. I wrote a little more than yesterday, and read several
							chapters in <persRef ref="u">Desodoard’s</persRef> History of <persRef

								Kurakin</persRef> had written from Vienna, that he was dead. He had
							been sent for last Summer to Willna— But after waiting some time at
							Warsaw, he had determined to return through Cracow, and Vienna to
							Paris.— On the road he was taken sick, and died at Cracow.— Prince
							Kurakin mentioned this Event in his letter with great concern. During
							the latter part of the time preceding the War, the Prince had seen
							nobody at Paris, but him; and there was no sort of kindness and
							attention that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow had not shewn him.
							The Prince had even deposited with him the Archives of the Russian
							Embassy at Paris, and was now anxious about them— The Count said he had
							no doubt but that on leaving Paris, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barlow had taken care to leave them in some safe custody; but he wished
							me to write concerning it— I told him I would write immediately, if he
							would have the goodness to indicate a mode to me of transmitting the
							letter— The Count asked me if I could not send it through Baron Blome,
							by the way of Denmark. He added that he had particular reasons for not
							wishing to point out to me a direct mode of Communication— I replied
							that I would very readily ask Baron Blome, to transmit a letter for me;
							or if I could send directly to Vienna; I would take that course— I had
							also some conversation with the Chevalier Bardaxi, for the first time—
							He had seemed before this to avoid it, and <persRef ref="colombi-maria"
								>Countess Colombi</persRef> had told <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> that he had some scruples whether to consider Spain
							and the United States at Peace— He was however now very communicative;
							and told me that when our Declaration of War against England had
							appeared he was at Lisbon; where the Portuguese Government had declared
							themselves neutral, and issued an Ordinance prohibiting the admission of
							prizes into their ports, by either party—that he had recommended the
							same course, and the same regulation to his own Government, and they had
							accordingly adopted them both. The exclusion of prizes, he <pb n="455"
								type="ms"/>said, was suggested to him as necessary, by the
							embarrassments and controversies into which they had been drawn,
							particularly with America, by having been obliged to admit prizes made
							by the French, into their Ports, during the last War— I told him I
							thought the regulation a very good one, and wished it could be made an
							universal law of neutrality.— Lord Cathcart spoke to me about the
							weather— We came home between 2 and 3. I walked before dinner; and
							passed the Evening in hearing <persRef ref="adams-charles2"

								Lewis</persRef> called upon me this morning, apparently in some
							agitation; he had formed here a commercial partnership with two
							brothers, <persRef ref="vonessen-christian">Christian</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="vonessen-peter">Peter Von Essen</persRef>; but being
							dissatisfied with them, the partnership was dissolved at the close of
							the last year— The House was in the name of Peter Von Essen, who was
							written up, as they term it, or registered, and had paid the tax as a
							Merchant of the first Guild, according to the Law and Custom of the
							Country— Neither Lewis nor <persRef ref="willing-richard"
								>Willing</persRef>, the other American partner had been written up—
							The Cargoes of several American vessels were consigned to them; part of
							which is sold upon credit; and part remains in possession of the
							house—that is to say of Peter Von Essen, the recorded merchant— In
							coming to a settlement of their Affairs the partners have quarreled— By
							an Article of their partnership, they bound themselves in a penalty of
							50000 Rubles, in case any difference between them should arise, to abide
							by the arbitration of <persRef ref="krehmer-benedict">Benedict
								Cramer</persRef>, and <persRef ref="martin-joshua">Joshua
								Martin</persRef>— Yesterday they left a Question to Benedict Cramer,
							who decided it in Lewis’s favour— Von Essen, refused to abide by it, and
							this day went to the Compting-House; took away two of the Books, and
							forbad the Clerk, who was their Cashier, from receiving any money for
							the goods sold, untill further orders from him— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lewis thought I could obtain from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, an order to take
							the books and all the property out of the hands of Peter Von Essen, and
							to deliver them to him— I told him that though disposed to render him
							every service in my power, I could not apply to Count Romanzoff for such
							an order, knowing that he would answer me, that it was a subject out of
							his Department, which must be left to the tribunals of the Country— He
							was very reluctant at resorting to the Law, which is in no higher repute
							here than elsewhere. I advised him then to compromise the matter as
							amicably and as advantageously as he could; but he seemed to think that
							impossible— He spoke to me about <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef>, of whom he mentioned
							circumstances which I was sorry to hear.— I received from Count
							Romanzoff a second Note, desiring me to come at half past seven this
							Evening, instead of six; and at his house on the Quay— I accordingly
							went, and mentioned to him that in consequence of the information of
								<persRef ref="barlow-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Barlow’s</persRef> death, I had thought of sending a Messenger by
							the way of Vienna to Paris; as well to ascertain the situation of our
							own affairs in France, as to give the necessary directions with regard
							to the security of the Archives of the Russian Embassy which had been
							deposited with him. That one of my Countrymen here who was desirous of
							going through Vienna to Paris had asked me some time ago, if I could not
							send dispatches by him, and obtain a Courier’s Passport for him; which I
							had then declined, having no special motive for sending dispatches, and
							wishing to avoid every unnecessary correspondence with France in the
							state of affairs between that Nation and Russia— But that now having a
							sufficient motive of public interest for it, I should request a
							Courier’s Passport for him, if there was no objection to granting one.
							The Count said that he would with pleasure give a Passport, to go either
							to Vienna, or to Copenhagen; or anywhere, but directly to Paris; that he
							might not have the appearance of knowing that the Courier was destined
							there— That he thought I was right in sending a special Messenger on
							this occasion, and I had an undoubted right to dispatch a Courier to the
							Agent of the United States in France, with whom they were at Peace— That
								<unclear>he</unclear> was sensible to the delicacy, I had shewn in
							previously consulting him to enquire, if he should have any objection to
							this measure— That he <pb n="456" type="ms"/>had none whatsoever— But
							his Passport would avail, only as far as the frontier— That the
							Austrians might stop the Courier, and not permit him to proceed to
							Vienna— They had already done so by some Prussian Officers, to whom he
							had given Passports; who had been full of zeal, and considered this as
							their own Cause— But the pusillanimous Austrians, from the fear of
							giving Offence to the French Government had refused them permission to
							go to Vienna— He asked if I could not obtain a Courier’s Passport from
							the <persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de
								Serra-Capriola</persRef>— I said that I should prefer giving him my
							own— That the United States had indeed no Minister at Vienna; but that
							they were at Peace with Austria, and I could see no reason why they
							should refuse admission or passage to an American Courier. I said I
							would also give him a letter to the <persRef ref="otto-louis">French
								Ambassador at Vienna</persRef>, who was an acquaintance of mine of
							nearly 35 years standing, and whom I should request to facilitate the
							admission of my Courier into France— The Count said he saw no reason why
							the Austrians should not respect my Passport, and that it would
							therefore be unnecessary to ask for any other— We had then some further
							desultory Conversation. He said he had English Gazettes to 8 January—
							That the renewal of the East-India Company’s Charter was the subject
							which appeared most to occupy the public attention there at present, and
							to occasion some temporary and local agitation— That in Spain they
							appeared to be doing nothing at-all, and <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Lord Wellington</persRef> had retreated into
							Portugal— I said the French could do nothing at all there neither; but I
							had heard they had not withdrawn any troops from there— The Count said
							he did not know.— I observed that if they had not withdrawn them, they
							very shortly must resort to that expedient— How else could they supply
							the place of that immense army they had lost in the North?— This brought
							the Count to talk of the destruction of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon’s</persRef> Army, which he said
							was so complete that scarcely any but the Officers had escaped— It
							reminded him of an Anecdote of the <persRef ref="bourbon-louis">Comte de
								Clermont</persRef>, who commanded the French Army in Germany, in the
							seven years War. He had suffered a great defeat, and dispersion of his
							troops; and was passing through a City, and stopp’d at a public house,
							where upon his enquiring of the Landlady Avéz vous un quelqu’un de nos
							fuyards?—she answered him “Non— Monseigneur est le premier.” An Answer
							which would now be perfectly applicable to a great number of Napoleon’s
							Marshals and Generals.— <hi rend="strikethrough">My interview with the
								Count was short and I came home before nine.</hi>— It was certain
							that Providence had reserved to itself almost entirely the agency in
							this Event— It was beyond all human calculation that the fame and glory
							of the Emperor Napoleon, founded on an uninterrupted succession of
							Victories for nearly twenty years, and which had become a sort of <hi
								rend="italic">Religion</hi> in Europe, should thus have vanished in
							the course of three months, before an old man of seventy-two years of
							age, whose own military reputation was a problem; and of whom many
							people here extolled very highly, while as many others held him in
							contempt— The Count alluded by this to <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail"
								>Prince Kutuzoff-Smolensky</persRef>, who certainly has very little
							contributed to the disasters of Napoleon and his Army.— I came home
							before nine.</p>

								ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon upon the Story of
							the Prodigal Son— There is something exquisitely tender and pathetic in
							this parable, without any mixture of the horrible incidents which form
							the history of the Levite and his Concubine. But Christ, who on this as
							on many other occasions, so irresistibly addressed the feelings and
							imagination of his hearers, never mingled the burlesque with the
							pathetic— It is expressly recorded upon one occasion that Jesus wept;
							but it is never mentioned that he laughed, and in all his discourses
							there is not a word that had a tendency to excite laughter in his
							disciples.— <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> says there is a
							time to laugh and as it is one of the pleasures of life which may at
							times be indulged with innocence it would be rather cynical rigour than
							virtue to proscribe it— But the pulpit is not the place for laughter—
							Religion is a subject upon which the mind should be too earnestly
							intent, for joking— In a Comedy, or a Poem upon the story of the
							prodigal Son, the Apes and Peacocks that lay dead upon his hands, and
							the Mummies that had not been dead long enough, the man of honour by
							whom he had been sold to a maker of graven images, and the whore of
							Babylon who swallowed his pearl, would furnish excellent materials for
							dramatic scenes, or poetical descriptions; but they are not suitable for
							a Sermon— The Satirical remarks upon the custom of sending young
							Englishmen of rank and fortune, to travel; or make what was called the
							tour of Europe, do not appear to arise very naturally from the story of
							the prodigal— But the picture of his departure and of his return, and
							especially the description of the father’s feelings are inexpressibly
							affecting.— I read also <persRef ref="mayhew-jonathan"
								>Mayhew’s</persRef> 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> and last
							Sermon to young Men— They are so excellent, that I am surprized they are
							not more in circulation in the Country where they were delivered. There
							were features in the character of this writer, bearing some resemblance
							to that of Sterne— He is sometimes keenly satirical, and sometimes uses
							irony, with an archness, that excites a smile— But he has little
							Imagination, and less power of pathos. He is always profoundly earnest,
							both in doctrine and reproof, and his morality though sufficiently
							indulgent, is not relaxed and equivocal like Sterne’s. In the Evening I
							read part of the <persRef ref="dutens-lewis">Dutensiana</persRef>—the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> Volume, added to the two of the
							Voyageur qui se repose— It is much less amusing; and seems to be the

							very important dispatches— He said that was nothing but the mediation—in
							which he supposed Austria was not sincere— Austria had made an offer of
							her mediation, for a general Peace, which <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> had accepted,—and his
							acceptance had been formally communicated to the several European
							Courts— But it was <unclear>in</unclear> terms which evidently shewed
							that he had no intention to make peace— It said that he accepted the
							mediation of his <hi rend="italic">puissant allié</hi> the <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor of Austria</persRef>; and would declare the
							basis on which he would negotiate, referring to his offer made to
							England last April, and adding to it, that Prussia must remain as
							heretofore; and Russia not to acquire a line, beyond her present
							Territory— Turkey to remain as by the Peace of last Summer, at
							Bucharest.— I asked him if he had any late news from England—he said
							none—there could be no important news from thence— It was in the North
								<unclear>th</unclear>at the destiny of Europe must be settled—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ducornau</persRef>

								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, to the Winter-Palace, and attended the Te Deum for
							a Victory of <persRef ref="winzingerode-ferdinand">General
								Winzingerode</persRef> over the Corps, commanded by <persRef
								ref="reynier-jean">General Regnier</persRef>— I met there besides
							the usual Members of the Corps Diplomatique, <persRef
								ref="divernois-francis">Sir Francis D’Ivernois</persRef>, whom at
							his request <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> introduced to me— He told me that he had formerly
							been acquainted with <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> in
							London; and had since been in Correspondence with him— That my father in
							one of his Publications had given him a title which did not belong to
							him; that of Doctor— He believed that the mistake had arisen, from his
							having once dined with my father at <persRef ref="price-richard">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Price’s</persRef>; and from Doctor
							Price’s having then several times at table addressed him, he did not
							know why as Doctor D’Ivernois— Sir Francis, who since that time has been
							knighted by the <persRef ref="george-iii">King of England</persRef>,
							doubtless considers the title of Doctor, as a sort of degradation, and
							it must have lain heavy upon his mind, for him to have made it after an
							interval of more than twenty-five years the first topic of Conversation
							with me. He had before mentioned it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris— He also told me that he was now going to travel over a Country,
							through which he knew that I had also been, and concerning which I had
							published a Book— He had not seen it— We had some further Conversation,
							which was however very soon interrupted, by the summons to the Te Deum.
							It was shorter than usual— On returning home, I read prayers for
							Quinquagesima Sunday, and <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon upon the character of <persRef

							bring forth a more propitious character— I importune Heaven with
							unceasing prayer— Let me Hope, that I shall at least be heard, in asking
