							considering the People of the United States as a part of themselves, and
							all their differences with them as a sort of family quarrel. Yet by
							their proposal of treating at Gothenburg, he thought they might be
							willing to treat under the Mediation of the <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Crown Prince of Sweden</persRef>, or the
							Swedish Government. I told him they had already refused that— The Count
							spoke of the last Battles in Spain as not decisive in their issue; and

							heard of private letters from Memel and Königsberg saying that the Crown
							Prince had taken 6000 Prisoners; but he thought it was no more than that
							the French had attempted to penetrate towards Berlin and had been
							repulsed.— The Count complained of having been very ill, and said he was

								>Count Alexander Soltykoff</persRef> and the Minister of the
							Interior <persRef ref="kozodavlev-osip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kosodavleff</persRef>. The band of music performed in the adjoining
							chamber, during the whole dinner— After the Emperor’s health had been
							drank, according to the usual custom, in Champaign, the Company all
							rising, a Court footman came in with a Note from the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-Mother</persRef> to the Count, which
							he immediately opened and read aloud to the Company— Its purport was—
							“Thanks be rendered to the most high— Our dear Emperor is in good
							health— He has won the most compleat victory over our Enemies—80 pieces
							of Cannon— Several Generals 2000 prisoners, &amp;c— I am in too great
							emotion to say more— Praised for ever be the Supreme Being.” Immediately
							afterwards a second Note was read by <persRef ref="markoff-arkady">Count
								Markoff</persRef>, which came I believe from the <persRef
								ref="saltykov-nikolai">Old Field Marshal Count Soltykoff</persRef>—
							It repeated the same tidings of victory; with the addition of Blucher’s
							Victory in Silesia, and another Victory won by the <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Crown Prince of Sweden</persRef>— This note
							added that among the Generals taken Prisoners was <persRef
								ref="vandamme-dominique">Van Damme</persRef>, who was already sent
							off to Moscow— That the Victory was decided by the Regiments of Guards,
							Preobrajensky, and Semenoffsky and the Regiment of Chasseurs which had
							highly distinguished themselves.— Count Romanzoff called up the footman
							who brought the Note, gave him a glass of wine, and embraced him,
							kissing him on both cheeks. A second glass of Champaign was ordered all
							round the table, and the Emperor was toasted over again— A tempest of
							exultation burst forth from all quarters, and it was universally agreed
							that <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte’s</persRef> Career was
							now finished— The Empress Mother’s Note was passed from hand to hand;
							and instead of 2000 prisoners as Count Romanzoff had read it was found
							to be 4000 or 9000.— In the midst of the hurly-burly came a Note to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kosodavleff the Minister of the interior,
							from the Director of the Post-Office, saying nothing more than that the
							Courier left Töplitz the 18/30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> this
							Circumstance cast some little damp upon the tumult of joy that was
							raging. How the Courier should have come from Töplitz occasioned some
							surprize— It was remarked that there were three Töplitzes, one in
							Bohemia, one in Saxony, and one in Silesia; and the question was from
							which of them the Courier came— Then it was noticed that neither the
							Empresses, nor Marshal Soltykoff’s note mentioned either time or place
							at which the battle was fought— <persRef ref="armfeldt-gustaf">General
								Armfeldt</persRef> said that Töplitz was forty Versts from Dresden;
							but it is at least sixty. It was known that before the battle the
							Emperor Alexander was <pb n="18" type="ms"/>at the gates of Dresden, and
							his troops were bombarding the City. Why the Courier after the Battle
							should have come from Töplitz was not enquired into nor accounted for.
							It was said that the Russian Accounts never gave dates either of time or
							place— It was unanimously concluded however that there was now a total
							dissolution of the French Army; and the doubt and distrust occasioned by
							the name of Töplitz was perceptible only on the countenance, and in the
							eyes of two or three persons— I came from the Count’s immediately home—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin sent me in the Evening the
							paper which was wanting to complete the duplicates of our dispatch to be
							sent by <persRef ref="stanwood-theodore">Captain Stanwood</persRef>.</p>

								<persRef ref="victor-claude">Victor</persRef> and <persRef

							Damme himself and seven other Generals prisoners with 7000 men—80 pieces

								rend="superscript">th:</hi> he turned about, crossed the Elbe at
							Königstein, marched down the river side; crossed it again and entered
							Bohemia— The Russian Army followed him down on the other side of the
							river— <persRef ref="kleist-friedrich">Kleist</persRef> with the

								ref="barclay-michal">Barclai de Tolli</persRef> covered himself with

							atchievements— The <persRef ref="constantine3">Grand Duke
								Constantine</persRef> distinguished himself at the head of the
							Guards, and the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> has given
							him a sword of honour, and a cypher on the shoulder. The <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor Francis</persRef> has promised to erect a
							monument in honour of the Russian Guards, on the plains of Töplitz where
							the Battle was fought— He said to the Emperor Alexander, “I put my
							person, my armies, and my dominions into your hands.” In a Postscript,
							the Emperor Alexander says, they are still bringing in Prisoners by
							thousands, found dispersed about in the woods— <persRef
								ref="vonblucher-gebhard">Blücher</persRef> on his side has defeated
							the French in Silesia—and as I dismount my horse I learn that the
								<persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">Swedish Crown Prince</persRef> has
							defeated <persRef ref="oudinot-charles">Oudinot</persRef>, taken 25
							pieces of Cannon &amp;c— Count Litta further said he had read an
							intercepted letter from a certain <persRef ref="u">General Catar</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">Lauriston</persRef>— A long letter which concluded
							by saying—I cannot disguise to your Excellency that three fourths of the
							Soldiers can no longer be made to fight— They throw away their arms, and
							neither intreaties, nor threats, nor honour, nor blows can bring them to
							their duty— They say that it is better to be taken prisoners than to
							perish with hunger, and misery.— My heart is rent with affliction, but
							your Excellency may nevertheless rely upon it that I shall do my duty.”—
							Count Litta said that all this was charming news, but when the details
							would come, then would be the time for the heart-aches of wives and
							mothers, and Sisters— It was impossible that such a Battle of four days,
							should have been won without great losses— Only one General was said to
							be killed; a <persRef ref="melissino-aleksey">General
								Melissino</persRef>— <persRef ref="ostermann-alexander">Count
								Ostermann</persRef> had lost an Arm, and <persRef ref="moreau-jean"
								>General Moreau</persRef> both his legs— He was at the Emperor’s
							side, on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and had just dismounted
							his horse, when a Cannon Ball carried away his two feet— His two legs
							were amputated the same day, and on the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> the Emperor writes that <persRef ref="wiley-james"
								>Wiley</persRef> gives him more and more hopes of his recovery.— The
							Emperor had made him his first Aid de Camp General, and Count Litta said
							the accident which had befallen him was unfortunate in itself, by the
							loss of his Services, and of the impression he might have made on the
							French troops; but it was terrifying when it was considered where he
							was— Whose turn might it be to-morrow?— What might the next Courier have
							to bring?— It was wrong for Commanders in Chief to expose their own
							persons without necessity—and it could never be necessary but by way of
							example, when the soldiers did not of themselves shew sufficient
							ardour.— The Te Deum was like all the rest, and we came home about 3
							O’Clock—the weather confined me at home the rest of the day.</p>

							<persRef ref="pages-francois">Pagés</persRef>, and something further and better in the Erudition Universelle of
								<persRef ref="bielefeld-jakob">Baron Bielefeld</persRef>— Pagés has
							copied whole chapters from this work with some additions which are no

							in his book relating to religion is bad. Bielefeld though not entirely
							correct is more modest and candid. Neither of them give the account of
							which I am in pursuit of the reformations of the Calendar— From
							Chronology and Astronomy, I was drawn to the tables of Logarithms by
								<persRef ref="callet-francois">Callet</persRef>— I ascertained the

							principle if they were entirely exploded from all literary composition—
							A writer should have the art of introducing every thing he has to say
							into the body of his work— Better a digression than a Commentary— Every

							an excrescence upon the body; a mole, a wart or a wen, according to its
