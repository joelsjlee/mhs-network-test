							O’Clock. we considered the answer we had received from <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s</persRef> Commission not
							extending to his object, I requested my Colleagues to take some order

							the Secretary for all the objects of the Mission; and that he had been
							appointed by an intimation from the Russian Government itself, or at
							least from <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef>. It was therefore determined that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris should act as the Secretary upon

							the draft of the Note concerning the Treaty with Russia, as finally
							settled. He also took my former Instructions from the Department of
							State, on this subject, with the Heads of a Treaty as they were sent to
							me. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin told me, that he and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had requested and had an interview
							with Count Romanzoff on Sunday Morning; in which they had suggested the
							wish to the Count, of being informed as soon as possible, if Britain
							should finally reject the Mediation, that they might not be
							unnecessarily <pb n="2" type="ms"/>detained here, with no prospect of
							accomplishing any useful purpose— <persRef ref="jones-lloyd">Captain

							who lived in the same house with us at Berlin, and whom we also met at
							Töplitz— I had first seen her in 1795 at the Hague. Her father was a
							General in the Dutch service, and Governor of Amsterdam when it was
							taken by the French in January 1795. He died at Berlin while we were
							there. His daughter married the Count de Bruges after we left that
							City.— I sent them an invitation to dine with us to-morrow.</p>

							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">Bayard</persRef>, would be desirous of being

							untill the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> orders should
							arrive; as it would be more respectful to him and the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empresses</persRef>. But if the young men
							wished to be presented I did not perceive any objection to that— I would
							consult my Colleagues, and give him a definitive answer, on the whole
							matter. He thought as I did that it would be best for the Envoys
							themselves to wait.— He told me that he had received the German
							Newspapers, by an estafette; but there was nothing in them— I observed
							that I had heard the War was likely to break out, even before the end of
							the armistice— He said it was expected; and the very silence of the
							German papers, <pb n="3" type="ms"/>made it the more probable; as they
							would naturally prefer saying nothing at such a crisis, and wait “pour
							voir eclater la Bombe.”— I asked him if the preliminary Congress which
							was to have met at Prague had actually been held— He did not know. He
							said he had seen in the English papers the account of the capture of our
							frigate Chesapeake, and the exultation in England upon it, which he
							thought was high testimony in honour of the Americans— I was a very few
							minutes with the Count, and from his house went to the lodgings of
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin and Bayard, but they
							were not at home— Walking on the Boulevard I met and returned with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Scott’s</persRef> Rokeby, which I think inferior to his former
							Poems.— I had this morning a visit from <persRef ref="krusentern-adam"
								>Captain Krusenstern</persRef> to say he had been to Pavlovsky on
							Wednesday and had not received my Note.— He told me that <persRef
								ref="dobell-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dobell</persRef>,
							an American whom he had known in China, and to whom the Emperor
							Alexander had sent a Brilliant-ring had lately arrived with a Cargo at
							Kamtschatka—which he regretted; for he would find there neither a
							market, nor good treatment. He would probably come here over land. The
							Governor of the place was not a good character.</p>

							sea—and that, not very good— The exportation of it from England, where
							it was good, was prohibited— Here it was allowed—the Clay comes from the
							borders of lake Ladoga— The pots last about four Months— Ours last not
							more than six weeks— He should be glad to take home with him about
							twenty tons of this Clay— He thought we might also derive some
							improvement from their mode of spinning flax here. M<hi

							the appointment of <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi

							the Treasury would be unconstitutional. The nomination of <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							opposed—probably on the argument that a mission to Sweden was

							and the Duke I walked round the gardens which are spacious and
							beautifully laid out; covered with forest trees planted by the Duke more
							than 20 years ago— We came home about nine in the Evening.</p>

								Todd</persRef> and <persRef ref="nicholson-william2">young

							from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>
							requesting me to call upon him, at his house in the Country between 6
							and 7 which I did— He said that in consequence of a Note from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							mentioning the desire of the Envoys to visit the several public
							Institutions of this City and Neighbourhood, he had written to all the
							Superintendents of those Institutions; and had received answers from all
							expressive of their readiness to shew the Gentlemen whatever was to be
							seen; with the exception of the Corps of Cadets, the Director of which
							had requested a postponement of their visit two or three weeks, it being
							now their time of Vacation— From the Palace at Czarsko-Zelo, he was
							notified that the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>
							would be absent at Kammenoi-Ostroff, next Saturday, Sunday and Monday;
							and that on either of those days they might see it better than they
							could at any time when the Empress should be there— He asked me whether
							they had determined respecting the presentation of the <persRef
								ref="gallatin-james;milligan-george;dallas-george">young
								Gentlemen</persRef>? I told him they had concluded to wait, that all
							the presentations might be at the same time— He said that would suit him
							well, as he expected very soon to receive the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> order, authorizing him to take and forward to
							him the Credential letter, and then all the presentations to the
								<persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empresses</persRef> might be at once—
							He then said there was another and a more important subject upon which
							he had asked me to see him— <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							had promised him a little Note; not official; nor signed but a sort of
							historical recapitulation of the state of our controversy with England,
							upon the great question of the War. That he wanted it to draw up his
							official Note to the Ambassador <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>, renewing the offer of Mediation. That he had now
							received the Emperor’s answer to his dispatch communicating the
							appointment of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin and Bayard
							previous to their arrival (v. my Journal of 22 June last.) That the
							Emperor had answered him haut comme ça all at once and had given him a
							whole history how his time had been taken up. From the extreme pressure
							of business and the military operations there had been only two days
							during which he could find time to read the pieces annexed to the
							dispatches, and to answer them— He had entirely approved of the Count’s
							suggestion that the offer of mediation should be renewed to England, on
							the arrival of the Extraordinary Mission from the United States; and had
							so fully authorised him to do it, that he should send his dispatch by a
							Courier directly to Count Lieven without even forwarding it to the
							Emperor’s Head-Quarters— He had promised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard, that when his
							dispatch for Count Lieven should be prepared, he would shew it to us,
							and make any alteration in it which we should desire, as he had done
							with me on occasion of a former dispatch to the same person— That the
							only object and motive of Russia was to produce the reconciliation, and
							in renewing the offer of Mediation he wished to enable Count Lieven to
							present every Consideration that might prevail upon the British
							Government to accept it. This occasioned his wish to have the little
							note historique, promised by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							&amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard. If the British Government
							should eventually reject the Mediation, it would have the effect of
							putting them in the wrong; not with us, because our only object and
							purpose is to conciliate; but with their own Opposition, who might
							charge them with the rejection of so fair an opportunity for making
							Peace— I told the Count that my Colleagues had mentioned something of
							this note, which they had promised him, but we had been in no haste to
							prepare it, under the uncertainty whether the Emperor might not say,
							that the British Government having declined his mediation he did not
							think it expedient to renew the offer of it— But that I would
							immediately inform my Colleagues, of what he now said, and the note
							could in a very short time be prepared.— He replied that we might take
							as much time as would suit our convenience— That to morrow he should go
							to Czarsko-Zelo, and he should be Thursday and Friday at Pavlovsky— If
							the Note could be ready on Saturday, it would be as soon as he could
							receive it— The <pb n="5" type="ms"/>Gentlemen had mentioned to him
							their wish, in case the mediation should be finally rejected by England
							to be informed of it as soon as possible, that they might not be
							detained here without any prospect of being useful to their Country—
							This was so just and proper, that he could say nothing in objection
							against it— And it was his only motive for wishing to expedite his
							Courier to Count Lieven— The saving of time when the object was Peace,
							was itself a precious object, and it was urged with irresistible force
							in the motive assigned by the President of the United States, for the
							appointment of the extraordinary Mission, without waiting for the
							certainty that Great-Britain would accept the Mediation. Between the
							mere chance of an unsuccessful Mission on one side, and that of a War
							unnecessarily continued for perhaps nine Months on the other, the
							disproportion of evil was so great that it was impossible not to approve
							the alternative, the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef>
							had chosen— But there would be now no occasion for precipitation.
							Perhaps the renewed offer might have a better chance of being accepted,
							at some interval of distance after the first effect of the great Victory
							in Spain— The Sensation which that had produced in France, was very
							great indeed— He knew it not only from Russian sources but also from
							others and authentic ones— But it was now to be seen what would be done
							with <persRef ref="suchet-louis">Suchet</persRef>, after <persRef
								ref="murray-george2">General Murray’s</persRef> re-embarkation, and
							abandonment of all his Artillery— He seemed to have been in tremendous
							fear of Suchet, and takes great pains to charge himself with all
							possible blame, by acknowledging that <persRef ref="carew-benjamin"
								>Admiral Hallowell</persRef> intreated him in vain at least to take
							time to save his Cannon.— I asked the Count if there was any information
							of the renewal of hostilities— He said—none— He had received the German
							Papers which are to arrive by the Post to-morrow; they are brought by
							Estafette, to the <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Minister of foreign
								Affairs</persRef>, from the frontiers, and arrive about 18 hours
							before the Post. He read me an official Article from the Berlin Gazette,
							announcing the prolongation of the Armistice to the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of August; which we knew before. I
							observed that I had seen an Article from a Vienna Gazette, speaking of
							the preliminary Congress at Prague— The Count said he really could not
							see why the<hi rend="italic">farce</hi> of holding that Congress was
							kept up. It was perfectly well known, it could come to Nothing. Very
							great Events were at hand, and a few weeks would bring them forth— He
							mentioned to me the arrival of <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General
								Moreau</persRef> at Gothenburg; said he had received a letter from
							him, and that he was gone on to the Emperor’s Head-Quarters.— I told him
							I had received an Answer from <persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton</persRef> to my letters
							informing him of the terms upon which he could obtain the privilege for
							navigating the Russian Waters by Steam Boats— I stated M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton’s wish to obtain the patent without
							coming here in person—his intentions concerning the Construction of the
							Boats, and the causes that prevented his coming in person— The Count
							desired me to write to him on the subject; which I promised— I spoke to
							him of the French translation of our Manifesto which I gave him some
							weeks ago, for publication— He said it should certainly be published,
							and now immediately if I wished— But he had delayed the publication,
							thinking that just now on the arrival of the Envoys, and at the moment
							of renewing the offer of Mediation, it might be more expedient to wait a
							few weeks longer— With this arrangement I expressed myself satisfied.—
							He then said that he had something to say to me, upon which he must lay
							aside entirely his official character and ask me to do the same with
							mine— He knew me, and the confidence with which he might speak to me— It
							was impossible he should so well know my Colleagues, though what he had
							seen of them had inspired him with a very high esteem for them— They
							were men apparently very different from each other, but each having a
							distinct and peculiar merit— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had
							a facility of communication, which gave him more readiness; but he had
							thought the remarks M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard had made
							indicated a strong, judicious and discerning mind, seizing at once upon
							the essential points of a subject, and discarding all the immaterial
							incidents to it— The Emperor had felt particularly gratified with the
							honourable notice the American Government had taken of his offer of
							Mediation, and wished to shew his sense of it by some peculiar token of
							distinction to the Extraordinary Mission— He had instructed him to think
							of something for that purpose, and there were only two ideas which had
							occurred to him as adapted to the object, if they were compatible with
							the usages and forms of our Country— The one was to defray the legation;
							and the other to present the Envoys, some particular production of the
							Russian manufactures— He wished merely to consult me and asked me freely
							to give him my sentiments— I answered, that I would consult my
							Colleagues, for their opinions— That for myself I felt highly grateful
							to the Emperor for his intention— I was very sure that my Colleagues,
							our Government and Country would all concur with me in this Sentiment—
							That as to the two expedients, without pledging either of the other
							Gentlemen to my opinion, I believed neither of them compatible with the
							ideas of our Country— That our Constitution forbad our public Officers
							from accepting presents or personal donations of any kind from foreign
							Sovereigns— He <pb n="6" type="ms"/>He said he was aware of that, but he
							had thought that this was not to be considered in the nature of a
							present or donation, but merely as a manifestation of respect, to
							distinguish the legation from an ordinary Mission— I replied that I
							would mention it to my Colleagues and they would judge for themselves—
							He enquired how they were lodged, and how they were satisfied with their
							Apartments— I told him they were tolerably good, but with not quite room
							enough, for both the Gentlemen &amp; their families. The Count spoke
							finally of the President’s last Message on opening the Session of
							Congress—in which he said there was a passage that had appeared to him
							not altogether clear, and he had seen some animadversions upon it in the
							English Newspapers— It spoke of the English pretension to search foreign
							ships, as being no right either of War, or of Peace— It might justly be
							asserted that it was no right of Peace—to search neutral Vessels— But
							surely the right of search could not be denied—the right of search in an
							Enemy’s ship— The right of War, was to do your Enemy all the harm you
							could— I said that I did not recollect the particular passage to which
							he alluded; but believed it referred only to search for men to
							impress—which the President said could be no right, either of War or
							Peace— The Count said it was hardly possible to limit the right of War,
							as against an Enemy. I answered that limits there must be— You could not
							for instance poison a Prisoner— You could not put him to death in cold
							blood— You could not compel him to serve against his own Sovereign— The
							Count said a prisoner might be put to death by retaliation; which I
							admitted, but said it proved my position—that you cannot put him to
							death, but by retaliation— He also said he had not known that the
							English now forced the impressed Americans to fight against their own
							Country— He asked me to read over again the President’s Message, and
							notice the passage to which he had referred—which I assured him I would—
							From his house I went to the Jesuit’s College, and delivered to the
								<persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">father General</persRef> the
							letters I had received for him— Thence I went to the lodgings of my
							Colleagues, and communicated to them the substance of the whole
							conversation I had just had with Count Romanzoff— As to the historical
							Note for the Count, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin gave me a
							sketch which he had drawn up as a Minute of what the Note should
							contain; with the request that I would return it to him to-morrow.— As
							to the honorary propositions the Gentlemen both thought as I did that
							neither of them would be suitable to the ideas of our Countrymen— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard thought the Legation would rather
							be degraded than honoured, by being defrayed— He said he could only
							compare it to the Tunisian Embassy which had been defrayed by us, in
							America— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin was a little surprized
							that Count Romanzoff should have imagined we could feel ourselves
							honoured by being defrayed— I thought that things of this sort should be
							estimated by the intention; and I was very Confident that the intentions
							both of the Emperor and of Count Romanzoff were sincerely to shew the
							Sentiment which the Count had professed.— They finally concluded that a
							proposition to provide them with Apartments, might be acceptable,
							because that might have the appearance of a mark of respect to the
							Mission, and that instead of being a pecuniary benefit to the Envoys
							personally, it would prove an additional expence to them; by the
							presents it would oblige them to <hi rend="italic">make</hi>.— On
							returning home I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd, and young
							Nicholson with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas at <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">our</persRef> house— They spent the

							the <persRef ref="u">Chamberlain Count Ozarovsky</persRef> sent to him,
							and he came to us in a few minutes— I went to the Inn and ordered a
							dinner for seven persons, but Count Ozarovsky, invited us all to dine
							with him, and urged us so strongly that we accepted and dined with him,
							upon which I sent and countermanded the dinner at the Inn, for which
							however I paid the Bill— We went over all the apartments at the Palace,
							and walked over all the grounds of the Gardens— The Palace is spacious,
							and has had an additional wing built to it within a few years. On each
							side of this wing is a porch supported by a Colonnade and filled with
							flowers in Pots— Under the Colonnade is a large Collection of Busts in
							Bronze, cast at the Academy of Science here; copies from Antiques, with
							only two exceptions; one of which is the <persRef
								ref="lomonosov-mikhail">Poet Lomonossoff</persRef>, and the other is
							the late <persRef ref="fox-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef>, placed between <persRef ref="demosthenes"
								>Demosthenes</persRef> and <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— The <persRef ref="catherinethegreat">Empress
								Catherine</persRef> sent for this bust at the time when <persRef
								ref="pitt-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt</persRef>
							threatened a War with Russia in 1790— But the Count told us that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox having afterwards made speeches
							against Russia, the Empress had the date inscribed under the Bust—to say
							it was Fox in 1790.— There is another singular date in this Palace— An
							Apartment, the Walls of which are entirely of Amber— It was a present
							from <persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederick 2</persRef>. of Prussia, to
							the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress Elizabeth</persRef>, in
							the year 1760. while she was waging against him that inveterate War— The
							date is therefore inscribed on the Wall— The floor and the doors of
							another Apartment are inlaid with mother of pearl— And the furniture,
							sopha’s and chairs are of Lyons stuffs, presented by <persRef
								ref="louis-xvi">Louis 16</persRef> to Catherine 2— The work, flowers
							and Birds is of the most exquisite kind; but the colours, which were
							originally pink, are faded.— There is a rostral Column of marble,
							standing on a foundation of granite, and surmounted by an Eagle, placed
							on an island in the Centre of a lake in the Garden, and to which we went
							in a boat. On another island, is a Hall for Concerts where the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef> sups two or three times
							a week.— The supper hall, with tables made to wind up and down with
							machinery is entirely disused and out of repair—we did not see it— There
							is a pyramid in honour of <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Marshal
								Romanzoff</persRef> like that fronting the marble Palace in the
							City.— The rostral Column on the Island is in honour of <persRef
								ref="orlov-alexeigrigoryevich">Count Alexis Orloff</persRef>, and
							his Victory at Tchesmé. The inscription is in Russian, and there are
							three Representations of bronze, in basso-relievo, of the action—
							Together with Catherine’s Generals and human favourites, her dogs are
							also here commemorated. There are grave’stones for three grey-hounds,
							with inscriptions as long, probably much more ingenious, and certainly
							more intelligible, for they are in French, than those in honour of
							Romanzoff and Orloff— The dogs were Sir Tom Anderson, Duchesse, and
							Zemire— The Epitaph of the last is in very elegant French verse by the
								<persRef ref="segur-louis">Count de Ségur</persRef>; they say that
							Zemire loved very much her whom every body else loved— But comment aimer
							en Repos, quand on a Cent peuples pour Rivaux?—and finally that the
							Gods, witnessing her tenderness had given her immortality— “Pour qu’elle
							fut toujours auprès de sa Maitresse.”— I <pb n="8" type="ms"/>believe
							there is nothing like this for Orloff and Romanzoff— We dined at Count
							Ozarovsky’s, and met there a company of about twenty persons, of both
							sexes, with none of whom we were acquainted— The <persRef ref="u"
								>Countess</persRef> was a Miss Mouravieff, and has been married
							between three and four years— She is young and handsome, and has a very
							lively <persRef ref="u">little daughter</persRef> nearly three years
							old. After dinner the Count went with us to the Alexander Palace, at
							which the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> resided before
							his accession to the throne. This is a much smaller building than the
							Imperial Palace, but built in a more modern style, and with newer
							furniture— The theatre is a separate edifice, but altogether disused—
							Two of the boxes are fitted up as Chinese Apartments more peculiar for
							rarity than beauty or elegance— We had some difficulty after returning
							to Miss Bode’s apartments to get our Carriage from the Inn— <persRef
								ref="u">Timosei</persRef> the servant on the authority I had given
							him to take with the other servants the dinner I had bespoken had made
							himself so drunk that he knew not what he was about— Between 8 and 9 in
							the Evening we left the Palace, and reached home about ten— We met the
							Empress, returning to Czarsko-Zelo, on the road.</p>

						<p><date>19. </date>After taking <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> this morning to school I called at the lodgings
							of my Colleagues and saw <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>— I mentioned to him
							that I was to see <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> at 12 O’Clock, and enquired if there was any
							thing further that he wished me to say to him— He said he only desired
							me to hasten as much as possible the Count’s further measures— And again
							hinted how irksome it was for him and <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef> to be here, <hi
								rend="italic">in prison</hi>, not allowed to see any body, and
							uncertain what to depend upon.— I asked him whether he would have me say
							any thing respecting the proposition to have apartments provided them by
							this Government— He said no— He would not have any such idea go from
							them— He had only meant to observe that if the proposition had come in
							that form, from this Government it would have been proper to be
							considered— I called upon the Count at Noon— He said that he had
							received our historical Note, which he had read with great attention and
							satisfaction— First, because it was very well done; and next because it
							was so fair and moderate, that he could not forbear to hope it would
							lead to a happy result— Unless England was determined at all Events
							against making Peace at-all— If that was the case indeed no proposition
							could be of any effect— But he could not presume such to be their
							intention, because, they had uniformly professed the contrary, and
							because whenever we (said he) have urged how much our Commerce suffers
							by this unfortunate War, they have always answered that their own
							Commerce suffers by it, in a much greater degree. <pb n="9" type="ms"
							/>The proposals which you have to offer, as you observe have never been
							considered by the British Government— They have declared that it was a
							subject upon which they had never refused to treat for a substitute to
							their present practice, and you offer an alternative which discards the
							question of right and tenders a compromise which Britain may accept even
							without the sacrifice of any of her pretensions— I entertain a strong
							hope that England will take these proposals into consideration; that she
							will finally agree to negotiate, and eventually be perfectly satisfied
							that the affair has taken this direction— But before I prepare my
							official dispatch to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>, I wished to anticipate all the contingencies that
							may happen; and sent to ask you whether if England should propose to
							transfer the Negotiation to London, you would have any objection to
							going there— I said, first that I could answer only for my own opinions,
							and begged to be understood as not pledging those of my Colleagues—
							Next, that the proposition to transfer the Negotiation to London, might
							be in one of two very distinct forms—one was, to treat, though at
							London, still under the Mediation of the Emperor, and the other was to
							set aside altogether the Mediation, and treat directly. That with regard
							to the second, he would find by the inspection of the full-powers, of
							which we had furnished him a copy, that our Commission was limited to
							negotiate under the Mediation of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>; and we could not treat otherwise than under that
							Mediation— As to going to London to treat there under the Emperor’s
							Mediation, I did not know that we were forbidden to do that— For my own
							part I should much regret the transfer; not only as it would remove me
							from my Post here; but as it would deprive us of the Advantage of having
							his the Count’s aid, as I had calculated very much upon the successful
							effect of his spirit of conciliation— But if England chose to make a
							point of it, I supposed we had sufficient authority to justify our going
							to London; if it should be advised by the Emperor— The Count enquired,
							observing that it was not with a wish to elicit any secret, or draw any
							indiscreet communication from me, whether we had not another power to
							treat with England directly—as it seemed a contingency which might have
							been anticipated by our Government— I said we had no such power to treat
							of Peace— That the object of the American Government was to accept the
							Emperor’s Mediation, in the most respectful manner, and with the same
							frankness that it had been offered— That it was not their intention to
							sue for Peace, nor was there any thing in our Condition, or in the
							result of the War hitherto, which could make it suitable for the
							American Government to send a special Mission to England for that
							purpose— That the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> might
							have thought it not altogether respectful to the Emperor, even to
							anticipate that England, his ally, making common Cause with him in their
							great War against France, should refuse his Mediation, while the United
							States, though as Enemies to Britain having a common Cause with France,
							the Emperor’s Enemy, had yet accepted his Mediation without an instant
							of hesitation. He said the acceptance of a mediation was always a
							voluntary thing, and he had more than once advised declining offers of
							that sort which had been made to this Country— I admitted that it was
							always voluntary, and that to decline it might often be perfectly
							proper; but in such cases there should be I thought a motive for
							declining, and it was scarcely possible to conceive such a motive in
							this case; unless it was that England did not choose to consider us as
							upon a level with other Nations;—he had heard from Count Lieven that
							they alledged the dispute with America involved principles relative to
							their internal Government, as a motive for their objection to the
							Mediation— The Count said I was mistaken—that he had not received such
							information from Count Lieven— But he certainly did tell me so on the
								22<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of June— I reminded him of the
							conversation in which he had mentioned it, but he seemed to have no
							recollection of it— There had been he now said no refusal on the part of
							England to accept the Mediation; but the last Autumn when the offer was
							made to them, they had said that they did not think the time favourable
							for a Negotiation of Peace, on account of certain pretensions which they
							said the American Government had then advanced; as he had informed us by
							his Note— The only way I can account for his denial now of what he told
							me on the 22. of June, is by supposing that Count Lieven’s Report at
							that time was of an inofficial Conversation, which as the Emperor has
							determined to renew the offer, the Count chooses at present to consider
							as nothing.— Confident as I am that he told me of it, as I recorded in
							my Journal of the day and wrote to the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef>, at the time, I should still think I
							had actually mistaken him, were not the precise idea which he stated to
							me as having been alledged to Count Lieven, the whole burden of <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baring’s</persRef> letter— Baring when he wrote that letter was
							fresh from <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereigh</persRef>,
							and avowedly communicates the sentiments of the British Government— The
							objection to the mediation there, is exactly the same as that which had
							been stated to Count Lieven— A family quarrel— A question about the
							rights and duties of Sovereign and Subject, and much more to the same
							purpose.— I told the Count I had also information by a <pb n="10"
								type="ms"/>private letter that England in accepting the proposal of
							the Congress at Prague, had expressly excepted the American question— He
							would remember that the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef> had proposed that the United States should be
							invited to send Ministers to that Congress— The Count said he much
							doubted whether England had made any such exception— It was certain that
							in her communications to this Government on that subject not a syllable
							about America was said. I observed that I supposed the answer must have
							been made to Austria— The Congress was proposed by the Emperor Napoleon—
							Acceded to by Austria as the Mediator— The proposition to England must
							have gone from her and to her the answer would of course be made— He
							said that was true but “on se communique, de telles piéces,” and as far
							as I know any thing about that Congress, nothing concerning America has
							been said by England— The Congress itself is one of those things against
							which I should have advised, if I had been consulted, and I own I do not
							yet understand in what sense the approbation of it by England is to be
							taken. Diplomatic affairs were formerly managed by few persons— They
							were like a Convent of Monks; and accordingly there was some gravity in
							the manner of transacting business— But now there are so many <hi
								rend="italic">dilettanti</hi>, that I for my part cannot see through
							it— As to the Congress, it does not appear that England has sent any
							body to it— Nor does the Austrian Envoy in England appear to be in
							activity— The Congress has not even been opened— <persRef
								ref="metternick-klemons">Count Metternich</persRef> is there—
								<persRef ref="narbonne-louis">Count de Narbonne</persRef> is there
							too, but he says he only came there on a party of pleasure— <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">M de Caulaincourt</persRef> seems to have
							been going between there and Dresden, to and fro, and to have had
							conferences with Count Metternich; but all this can come to nothing— I
							asked if the hostilities had commenced as was reported— He said not yet;
							but very great Events were at hand. I mentioned an Article in the
							Gazettes, stating that two English Plenipotentiaries had landed at
							Helvoet-Sluys, and were proceeding to the Congress— He said he had seen
							the Article, but it was merely Gazette news— He questioned its
							authenticity.— I then mentioned to him the wish of my Colleagues that he
							would inform us by an official note of his intention to renew the offer
							of the Mediation— I said they were very anxious under the responsibility
							of remaining here with the knowledge that England had declined the
							Mediation, and with the prospect of doing nothing. That they wished to
							be released from their uncertainty as soon as possible, and flattered
							themselves that he would hasten the business as much as he conveniently
							could— He said that he was going to-morrow to Czarsko-Zelo—that he would
							endeavour to prepare his dispatch to Count Lieven there, before his
							return; that when it was ready he would communicate it to us all as he
							had promised, and then furnish us with a copy of it, which he thought
							would answer their purpose better than a Note merely announcing his
							intention to send the dispatch— He readily conceived the anxiety of
							persons employed in important stations at home, not to be detained
							unnecessarily abroad; but he thought they should not permit any
							impatience to gain upon them— There must be some time allowed for
							business of such importance as this.— I take it for granted from the
							tenour of his conversation this day, that he does not intend to dispatch
							his Courier to Count Lieven, untill he shall have heard again from the
							Emperor.— He then asked me as to the petite Commission, that he had in
							charge from the Emperor, of shewing some special mark of honour to the
							Mission. I told him that I found the ideas of my Colleagues coincided
							with those I had expressed to him— With regard to the Emperor’s
							intentions they felt highly gratified, and grateful— But they considered
							both the proposals of defraying the Mission, and of making presents from
							the Manufactures of this Country as incompatible with our Constitution—
							That any token of respect from this Government to the mission, applying
							to the American Government and Nation, rather than personally to the
							Envoys would be very highly valued; but nothing which could assume the
							shape of personal advantage or profit to the Envoys themselves— Without
							presuming to indicate a mode of expressing favour, to the Emperor, we
							have thought that the very words in which the mission and its reception
							should be announced in the official Gazettes, might be made fully to
							manifest the Emperor’s intention to do honour to it; and have its proper
							effect on the opinions of Europe generally and in particular on those of
							England— He said he should take care of that, and hoped we should be
							satisfied in this respect; but that would not be what was the Emperor’s
							intention— However if it was not compatible with our Constitution, there
							was nothing further to be said— Every country had its “maniere de voir,”
							and it was not worth while to run counter to it— His own idea had been,
							entirely to defray the Mission: but it was only to treat it in a more
							honorary manner, than as an ordinary Mission— As, for example when he
							had been to Paris, the Emperor Napoleon had made it a point to treat him
							in a manner totally distinct from the treatment of an Ambassador— He
							asked me if the Gentlemen would be disengaged, so that they with the
								<persRef
								ref="gallatin-james;milligan-george;dallas-george;todd-john">young
								Gentlemen</persRef> attached to the Mission could <pb n="11"
								type="ms"/>come and dine with him next week in the Country— I said I
							presumed they would be.— I asked him if <persRef ref="walpole-horatio"
								>Lord Walpole</persRef> had arrived—he said, not here but he might
							be gone to Head-Quarters— I gave the Count a Letter I had written him
							concerning <persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fulton’s</persRef> business— He lent me the English Morning
							Chronicles to 27. July, containing some British dispatches from
							America.— I went immediately from the Count’s and informed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard of the substance of my Conversation with him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard intimated the wish that the Count

							these Gentlemen <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>24. </date>My Landlord <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Strugoffshikoff</persRef> came to me this morning to
							enquire again whether I had determined upon taking the house for another
							year, or to remove at the end of the present Month— He said he was sent
							by <persRef ref="u">his mother</persRef> to enquire; she having heard
							that we were looking out for other houses— I told him I should send him
							a definitive Answer this Evening or to-morrow Morning. <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> sent notes to my
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert;bayard-james">two Colleagues</persRef>
							and me, requesting us to call at his house in the Country, between 1/2
							past 5 and 6 O’Clock this Evening— At the time appointed I went to their
							lodgings, but they were already gone— I found them at the Count’s— He
							told us that he had received a letter from the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, dated on the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of this month saying that the Simulacre
							d’un Congrés at Prague had broken off, and that on the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> at Midnight <persRef
								ref="metternick-klemons">Count Metternich</persRef> had delivered to
							the <persRef ref="narbonne-louis">Count de Narbonne</persRef> the
							Austrian Declaration of War against France, to be transmitted to the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— Which
							event adds the Emperor Alexander, fully justifies my conduct towards
							Austria— Because, said the Count he knows that he has been reproached
							for his confidence in Austria— He says further that this will give
							300000 men more in support of the common Cause—and that more than 100000
							of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> troops, (by which expression the Count did
							not know whether he meant all Russian, or joint Russian and Prussian
							troops) had already entered Bohemia— The Emperor proceeds to say, that
							he was going to Prague, to have an interview with the <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor of Austria</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count Wittgenstein</persRef> commands <pb
								n="12" type="ms"/>the troops that have entered Bohemia;—the
							hostilities were to commence on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							and the allies were to assume the offensive. The Count said the Courier
							who brought the dispatches reported that the French troops in Silesia
							had already commenced their retreat. He was a little surprized that the
							Emperor Napoleon had not been the first to attack; as he was much in the
							habit of anticipating his Enemies— A few days must bring the news of
							some great Events. <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General Moreau</persRef>
							has passed through Berlin, going to the Emperor Alexander’s
							head-Quarters, and was accompanied by <persRef ref="rapatel-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rapatel</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef> was gone the same way,
							and was styled in a Prussian Passport, Minister Plenipotentiary to the
								<persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king of Prussia</persRef>— He
							is not coming here.— The French pretend to have had some new success in
							Spain, in which they took 5000 prisoners; but perhaps they were only of
							the Guerilla’s— The English Gazettes from 27 to 30 July, say that
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph Bonaparte</persRef> had
							collected about 20000 men at Bayonne; and had been joined by 10,000 more
							of the militia— The Count lent us these English papers, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin took them with him. After the
							general Conversation, the Count read to us the dispatches to <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>, directing him to
							renew to the British Government the proposal of the Emperor’s Mediation—
							They consisted of a short letter to Count Lieven instructing him to
							present the Official Note to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>— The Official Note itself, ready drawn, and
							only to be signed by Count Lieven—and a longer letter to him, urging
							arguments to induce the acceptance of the Mediation by the British
							Government— This letter Count Lieven is authorized to communicate in
							extenso to Lord Castelreagh— There was one passage in the official Note,
							and one in the long letter, to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin suggested objections, and which Count Romanzoff altered— That
							in the letter, was in stating the wish of my Colleagues not to be
							detained here without any prospect of being useful to their Country— The
							Count had alledged as their motive for this wish, the places which they
							occupy (as he believes) in the Administration of the American
							Government— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin preferred to have
							the motive omitted altogether— The Count struck it out—the other, in the
							Note, was a reference to the last paragraph of Lord Castlereagh’s letter
							to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> of 29. August 1812— In the Count’s quotation, he
							had understood Lord Castlereagh as having expressed a positive refusal
							of Britain to <hi rend="italic">suspend</hi> the exercise of the right
							of impressment without qualification— But the refusal, as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin remarked was conditional; untill
							they were sure that other means could be devised— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin asked to have the word <hi
								rend="italic">suspendre</hi> in the Note, changed for the word <hi
								rend="italic">abandonner</hi>. The Count changed it— In both
							instances however he manifested some little repugnance— In the first, on
							the question of the motive, he seemed at first inclined to argue the
							point; but observed that he had promised to make any alteration we
							should suggest— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said we thought
							the best way we could shew our sense of his obliging confidence was to
							avail ourselves of it.— At the question upon the word in the Note, the
							Count insisted that he had used the very words of Lord Castlereagh, and
							turned to the printed Document itself— He found that he had the very
							word <hi rend="italic">suspend</hi>, but that by quoting it as
							unqualified, he had not the exact sense of it which was conditional—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said that his motive for
							asking the change was that the very heart of our negotiation depended
							upon that word— The British Government had refused to abandon— We did
							not now ask them to abandon— We should ask them to suspend; which they
							had not yet refused— The Count on reading over the paragraph of Lord
							Castlereagh’s letter, acknowledged that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin was right and changed the word in his Note— Neither M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard nor I made any objection, or asked
							any alteration to the papers.— I was gratified at observing the Count’s
							candour, in acknowledging his mistake, in the quotation, as well as the
							quickness and readiness of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin—his
							perfect possession of the subject, and the address with which he averted
							the allegation of the motive upon which he and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bayard were desirous of not being unnecessarily detained
							here.— The Count said he should send off his Courier with the dispatches
							to Count Lieven in three or four days; without transmitting them first
							to the Emperor— He promised also to send us copies of the Note and
							Instruction— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard enquired how long it
							would probably be before the answer would come— The Count could not
							tell—it depended upon the winds— But said we should dine at his house
							to-morrow with young <persRef ref="vorontsov-mikhail">Count
								Woronzoff</persRef> who is attached to the Russian Embassy at
							London, and came as Courier— He could tell us how long the passage
							was—though indeed he first came to the Emperor’s Head-Quarters— The
							Emperor had sent him on here; to spend some time with his friends, and
							then return to England.— We now resumed the general Conversation, which
							turned upon the Spanish Colonies in South America; and their prospects
							of returning to the dominion of Spain upon the state of our Manufactures
							in the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin said he
							had some statements and returns upon the subject which he promised to
							give the Count. Our conference was little short of an hour— After
							returning into the City I walked home. <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Redwood</persRef> spent the
							Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Redwood has not yet engaged his passage
							for Sweden; but when ready to go, is to give me two or three days
							notice.</p>

							copies of the papers which he read to us last Evening; and should
							dispatch the Courier to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count

							send a Courier to Vienna, and offered to forward any letters for me

							of the manner in which <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pope</persRef> had lost his seat in the Senate of the

							And he thought that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope had been
							abandoned by those whom he supported— He also gave me some information
							concerning the state of parties in the United States Senate. He thought
								<persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> the ablest and most influential man
							in it, at the time of his appointment to France. <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.

							but without ability to maintain it. He says <persRef ref="lloyd-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd</persRef> resigned his
							Seat for fear of being obliged to fight Campbell— That Campbell was
							continually insulting him— That by shooting <persRef
								ref="gardenier-barent">Gardenier</persRef> he had got a formidable
							reputation; and that Lloyd, though excessively testy and irritable, had
							become adverse to fighting, now he was married— Campbell, he said fairly
							drove him out of the Senate; and at the close of the last Session, he
							Bayard was very sure Lloyd would never come there again. He further said
							he was sure the Senate would not confirm the appointment of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to this mission, unless another
							appointment was made of a Secretary of the Treasury. As to himself he
							could not hold his place as a Senator with this appointment— He had
							therefore written to the <persRef ref="haslet-joseph">Governor of
								Delaware</persRef>, communicating the fact of his appointment, and
							the Legislature had chosen <persRef ref="wells-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wells</persRef> to his place in the
							Senate— But when I go back said he, I can have my seat in the Senate
							again if I please— Either of the Gentlemen, would immediately resign for

						<p><date>26. </date>Morning visit from <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							at their lodgings— We had some Conversation concerning the letter to be
							written to our Government— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							proposed to me to make a draft of it; but I thought it more proper that
							it should be drawn up by them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin
							asked me if I would then make the Translation of our inofficial
							historical Note, which I readily promised, and offered to take upon me
							any thing of mere labour which they would see fit to assign to me—
							Adding that I would decline nothing of any other kind with which they
							would charge me, but if they preferred it would leave the drafting to
							them— It has appeared to me that each of them was at first a little
							tenacious of this originating part of the business, and I determined
							from the first moment I perceived it, to accommodate myself entirely to
							their wishes. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard hinted to me that
							from the composition of the mission, the People of America would have
							high expectations of the ability of all our official papers; and that to
							make them as perfect as possible, we must animadvert very freely upon
							each other’s work— This may be very proper, particularly if there should
							be controvertible papers to be drawn; but to make three drafts of every
							formal Note or letter we have to write, which any private Secretary
							would be as competent to write as either of us, would seem to me making
							a Mountain of a Mole-hill— So I intend to leave all composition to them
							at their discretion. We considered the manner in which it would be most
							advisable to report our interviews with Count Romanzoff. My practice has
							been to give the whole substance of my Conversations with him in my
							dispatches to the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>; but as all our joint dispatches will be published,
							we concluded it would not be proper to pursue this method. But only to
							notice what was material, and in such a manner, as that the Count may
							have no occasion to regret any <pb n="14" type="ms"/>Confidence in
							conversing with us— If it be necessary to write any thing which ought
							not to be made public, it must be addressed to the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> himself.— M<hi

							publication, and the other confidential— I did not think it necessary—
							All the <persRef

								>Gentlemen</persRef>, together with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris went to Peterhoff— At M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s

							gone; but that the <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">Minister of
								Finance</persRef> would send one this day, by whom we could write—
							By a subsequent Note he gave us time for the Courier untill to-morrow

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willing is so unwell that he cannot

								Fosdick</persRef>— Walked after dinner in the Summer-Gardens, where
