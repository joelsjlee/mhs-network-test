							scarcely forbear in reading it from laughing. There is likewise sharp
							censure upon the enthusiasm of the Methodists, of which however he
							speaks with more seriousness. Sterne appears to have thought that
							Ridicule was the best weapon of attack upon Popery; but he had not
							delicacy of mind enough to perceive that the pulpit was no place for

								ref="carneades">Carneades</persRef>; but the fragment breaks off
							just as a magnificent panegyric upon Carneades begins— The second is a
							discussion of the academic principle, universal doubt, which Lucullus
							attacks as a follower of <persRef ref="zeno">Zeno the Stoic</persRef>,
							and which Cicero defends— There is in this second book a passage p. 191.
							which together with another in <persRef ref="plutarch"

							has given the English Lords of the Ocean cause for serious reflection—
							It gives the same to us; and to my Heart, motives of ardent Gratitude to
							God, that our National character has been thus honourably maintained— I
							pray that it may continue to be supported with equal Glory; and that it
							may turn the Hearts of our Enemies to Peace— I passed much of the day in
							reading these Papers; and the rest in writing to America.— Thermometer

							ludicrous and the pathetic, that in reading it, I was more than once
							unable to refrain from laughter and from tears— There is something
