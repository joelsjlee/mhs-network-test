								>Admiral Bentinck</persRef>, at the English Church at 6 O’Clock in
							the afternoon. Having attended the same service there several times

							that hour— The service was just finished at the moment when we arrived,
							which gave me a new lesson of punctuality. I went nevertheless into the

							<persRef ref="pitt-london">Pitt</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">Duke of Oldenburg</persRef> had

							apologized to me for not having sent me the certificate which I had
							asked him some Months since— I asked D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Beresford, what was the rule of the Greek Church for determining the
							time of Easter— He did not know— The <persRef ref="u">Abbé
								Lavoisier</persRef> the other day was unable to answer me the same
							question— <persRef ref="divernois-francis">Sir Francis
								d’Ivernois</persRef> stop’d me to ask me again about my Silesian
							Letters— He said he had enquired at the Booksellers, and could not

							with me, and we had a long conversation together, upon political

							that the British Ministers deplore the War with America— M<hi

								<persRef ref="crichton-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval</persRef> had told him
							a very few days before his death that he was determined upon a War with
							America— Sir Francis said he did not believe that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval had ever said any such thing to
							Sir Robert Wilson—that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval was the
							only member of the British Cabinet, deeply, strongly, inflexibly
							attached to the Orders in Council; that he probably would not have
							abandoned them to prevent a War with America— But he did not believe
							they would produce a War— Sir Francis said that he had been very
							intimately acquainted with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval, who
							had been with him, and left him not five minutes before he was murdered.
							That he had often conversed with him on the subject of America— That
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval always expressed himself
							averse to a War, with America—but he did not believe it would come to a
							War— Sir Francis appeared to hope that the War between America and
							England would yet be short— <unclear>He</unclear> founded his hopes on the expectation
							that the War would become too unpopular in America to be pursued— On
							this point as on almost every other I found his opinions at the greatest
							possible variance from mine— As to the question of impressment he said
							he did not see how that could be settled unless all the sailors in the
							British Navy would submit to be tattooed, with a G.R. in indian ink upon
							the arm— But he doubted whether they would consent to that— This is the
							strangest expedient that I believe was ever devised— But he mentioned it
							seriously— We talked about the American Revolution, the War against
							which he thought had been excessively <hi rend="italic">impolitic</hi>
							in Britain— But as to the Justice of the case he had his doubts— But he
							said he was one of the small number of persons who believed the loss of
							the American Colonies to have been the Origin of the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king of England’s</persRef> Malady— As Sir Francis
							is under personal obligations to the king of England I did not think it
							suitable to tell him what I thought—that he had mistaken the Cause for
							the effect.— I made a short Evening again—longer however than the

							do not observe it— He thought the only difference was of the Old and New
							Style— But that is not all— Easter this Year is celebrated here the <hi

							that of the Petersburg levy of men last Summer, of one Man in ten, the

							first and last weeks with great rigour, and in them they are not allowed
							to eat fish— No animal food of any kind—scarcely any-thing but bread,
							Oil, and mushrooms, dry— The common people, he says, consider a
							violation of the lent, as the most heinous of Crimes— Murder they
							suppose may be pardoned, but to break the fast is a Sin utterly
							irremissible— He himself kept the fast last week; not from a religious
							scruple, but because he <unclear>th</unclear>ought it a salubrious practice, and an
							useful one, to form habits of self-denial— I am of that opinion myself,
							and I have often wished that <unclear>th</unclear>e reformers who settled New-England had
							not abolished the practice of fasting in lent— I am convinced that
							occasional fasting, &amp; particularly <unclear>ab</unclear>stinence from animal food,
							for several weeks at a time and every year, is wholesome both to body
							and mind— It is true that fasting is not expressly <unclear>en</unclear>joined in the

								ref="paley-william">Paley’s</persRef> Evidences of Christianity, a
							book from which I have derived some information, and some confirmation
							to my faith— His argument is strong, ingenious, and convincing. His
							style, clear and lively, though always temperate— He establishes the
							Evidence of Christ’s Miracles upon an immoveable basis— He adduces the
							testimony of <persRef ref="clement-i">Clemens Romanus</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hermas">Hermas</persRef>, <persRef ref="polycarp"
								>Polycarp</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ignatiusofantioch"
								>Ignatius</persRef>, and the succession of Christian writers during
							the three first centuries of Christianity, in a manner which ought not
							to have been, but which was new to me— This part of his works is
							avowedly a mere abridgment from <persRef ref="lardner-nathaniel"
								>Lardner’s</persRef> Credibility of the Gospel History— A Book which
							I possess in America, but never read— Paley’s principal object is to
							refute <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume’s</persRef> Essay upon Miracles;
							which he does much to my satisfaction. He contests very successfully
							Hume’s first principle; that no Evidence can be sufficient to obtain the
							belief of a miracle— He discriminates between the three instances of
							Miracles mentioned by Hume, as the best authenticated in history, and
							those of Christ and his Apostles, with great sagacity, and demonstrates
							that any comparison between them is absurd. He is equally powerful in
							proving that a parallel between the progress of Mahometanism and that of
							Christianity is utterly fallacious. The Part of D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Paley’s Book with which I am least satisfied is precisely
							that which I was most curious to read—the Chapter on the Morality of the
							Gospel— He adopts without Qualification the whole of <persRef
								ref="jenyns-soame">Soame Jenyns’s</persRef> internal Evidence of
							Christianity; which <persRef ref="maclaine-archibald">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> M’Laine</persRef> of the Hague
							strongly objected against— I think he does not estimate its value the
							peculiar merit of the gospel morality— He strongly intimates and perhaps
							formally admits that the Christian Morality is not applicable to men in
							the public relations of Nations— In the excess of Candour he concedes
							too much to the adversary. The laxity of his Moral Philosophy, which has
							been justly censured by <persRef ref="gisborne-thomas2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gisborne</persRef> infects even that
							part of this Book— Perhaps this sort of composition with the World may
							be the means of retaining within the Christian fold many who by
							adherence to a more rigorous discipline might be driven from it— But it
							does not accord with my ideas of the truth— Peace on Earth, good will to
							Men; it seems to me was as essential a part of Christ’s Mission, as the
							promise of a future life.</p>

							Evening walk finished the second of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Dialogues de Natura Deorum— Containing the
							exposition of the Stoic Doctrine by <persRef ref="balbus-quintus"
								>Balbus</persRef>— It is strange to observe how justly and strongly
							the Stoics laid down their premises, and how absurdly they drew their
							Conclusions— In the first Chapter of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Paul’s</persRef> Epistle to the
							Romans, says The invisible things of God from the creation of the world,
							are clearly seen, being understood, by the things that are made; even
							his eternal power and Godhead— This argument from the visible Creation,
							and its order is precisely that upon which Balbus dwells; he insists
							upon it with such earnestness, and spreads out the proof into such
							minute detail that <persRef ref="cotta-lucius">Cotta</persRef> in his
							reply makes the very anxiety with which he hangs upon it an evidence
							that the point was not so clear and obvious as he had asserted it to be—
							Why so eager to multiply proofs, says he, of what you assert to be
							self-evident. And this is all the reply attempted by Cotta, to that part
							of the argument— But the error of the Stoics was, in considering the
							intelligence displayed in the physical Government of the World, as
							residing in the material world itself— They never conceived the idea of
							God as a Creator, nor his omnipotence, nor his Unity— Balbus’s Syllogism
							is “That which is endued with reason, is better than that which is
							not[”]— But there is nothing better than the World— Therefore the World
							is endued with Reason. This notable process he takes from <persRef
								ref="zeno">Zeno</persRef>, the founder of the sect, who proved by
							the same middle term that the World (meaning the Earth) was wise, was
							happy, was eternal, and in fine was God—or rather a God— For on the same
							principle he takes each of the planets and fixed Stars to be a God;
							besides innumerable others— Cotta ridicules these Syllogisms as they
							deserve, and assigns certainly a better reason for his belief of the
							Gods—the authority of their Ancestors— Because they were of the
							religious Establishment. Because he had been taught to believe and
							worship them— Because he was a man of rank and reputation, and moreover
							an Augur—which Balbus in closing <pb n="467" type="ms"/>his discourse
							had desired him not to forget. It seems to me one of the strongest
							indications of the weakness of the human understanding that the Stoics
							after inferring an intelligent principle from the order of the universe,
							should not have perceived at least the unity of that principle, or have
							discovered that from a multitude of distinct and independent
							intelligences disorder and confusion must result as necessarily as from
							no intelligent principle at-all— S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul
							accounts for it, and it is on this very topic that he says, professing
							themselves wise, they became fools.</p>
