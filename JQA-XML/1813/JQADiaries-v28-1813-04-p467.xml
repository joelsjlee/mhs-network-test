								ref="proud-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Proud</persRef>;

							from England, <pb n="468" type="ms"/>and is going on to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> Head-Quarters— He

							and to him this dinner was apparently given. The <persRef
								ref="deparseval-pierre">Comte de Briou</persRef> was there, an old

								>Count Stedingk’s</persRef> and at the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao"
								>Chevalier Bezerra’s</persRef>— He has been a sort of Agent or
							Minister from Louis 18. but hitherto not recognized.— The <persRef
								ref="depolignac-jules">Duke de Polignac</persRef> was likewise one
							of the Company— I had dined there with him once before— I had some
							Conversation with <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef>,
							who is in great anxiety— He told me that the proposition for Peace made
							by Denmark to England had been rejected— The answer had been that they
							must treat at Stockholm, and on the basis of ceding Norway to Sweden—
							The Baron said this was a proposal to which it was impossible for
							Denmark to listen; but he did not know what his Government would do.—
							The news had just been received of the taking of Hamburg by the
							Russians— <persRef ref="gurieff-nikolai">Young Gourieff</persRef> had
							carried the keys of the City to <persRef ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count
								Wittgenstein</persRef> at Berlin— The whole City, 75000 people came

							never before known— The mayor of the City Abendröth (a sinister name as
								<persRef ref="budberg-andrea">Baron Budberg</persRef> observed) they
							had thrown out of the windows— The <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii"
								>king of Prussia</persRef> has written a letter to <persRef
								ref="kutuzov-mikhail">Prince Kutuzoff</persRef>, placing all his
							troops, under his command; submitting to him without restriction the
							whole management of the War, and requesting him to take the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iv">Prince Royal of Prussia</persRef> for his
							Aid de Camp— This it was remarked was the only way in which any thing
							could be done to good purpose— I sat at table between Baron Budberg, and
								<persRef ref="oubril-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Oubril</persRef>, who reminded me that he had seen me at Berlin,
							where he was a Secretary to <persRef ref="krudener-bourkhardt">Baron

							English Embassy, Nor the <persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke of
								Serra-Capriola</persRef>, nor <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count
								Maistre</persRef> were there— But the Secretary and two Captains of
							the Spanish Legation were present— It was in truth a Bourbon dinner, and
							reminded me of the Resurrection of dry bones in the Prophet <persRef
								ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef>— Count Romanzoff was courteous as
							usual; but has more and more the appearance of declining influence— When
							I returned home, I found it useless to attempt reading— As we came down
							the stairs from the <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Counts Baron

								ref="balbus-quintus">Balbus</persRef> the most probable— <persRef

							dissimulation; for that Cotta delivers the real sentiments of Cicero— He
							draws the inference from the absurdity of the Stoic opinions, and the
							impossibility that Cicero should have believed them— There is one point,
							and that a very important one, in which Olivet the translator agrees
							with Cotta—which is that in matters of religion, we must not rely upon
							Reason, but take refuge in Authority. But to me this is impossib<unclear>le.</unclear> I
							have no cause for peculiar Confidence in my own Judgment, but I cannot
							seat my faith upon the mere authority of other men— I began reading the

							at my ordinary occupations— Yet I wrote only one short letter, and
							finished reading the first and began upon the second Book de Finibus— A
							Disquisition upon the supreme Good— There are five Books—the first and

								>Cicero’s</persRef> villa at Cumae, between him—<persRef
								ref="torquatus-lucius">Torquatus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="triarius-caius">Triarius</persRef>— Torquatus in the first
							Bo<unclear>ok</unclear> sets forth the Epicurean Doctrine, which makes the summum bonum
							to consist in pleasure— It is refuted by Cicero in the second. Torquatus
							according to the fashion of the Epicureans applies great part of his
							discourse to the panegyric of the Graïus homo— But Cicero handles him
							v<unclear>ery</unclear> roughly, charging him with a total ignorance of physics, an
							absurd disdain of dialectics, a loose confused employment of terms, and
							a doctri<unclear>ne</unclear> pernicious and detestable in morals— He says particularly
							that Epicurus held the Sun to be only three feet in diameter, and not
							larger than it appears to the human eye— And that he formally objected
							to all definitions of terms— A principle laid down by Torquatus is that
							the absence of pain is the most exquisite pleasure, and Cicero appears
							to labour with the utmost earnestness the contradiction of this maxim,
							which he says confounds the Nature of things— There is an ardour,
							partaking of Passion in all Cicero’s attacks upon <persRef
								ref="epicurus">Epicurus</persRef>, but I believe it was well
							found<unclear>ed.</unclear> The principles of that philosophy may properly be called the
							philosophy of Corruption, and it has always prevailed in company with
							the <pb n="469" type="ms"/>the grossest licentiousness of morals, and
							the most infamous vices. Torquatus intimates that Cicero’s aversion to
							Epicurus arises from his having neglected the ornaments of language, and
							not written oratorically like <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>— But
							Cicero assures him that this is not the foundation of his objections—
							That Epicurus writes well enough to make himself understood, which is
							sufficient— That it <hi rend="strikethrough">h</hi>is not his Style, but
							the substance of his doctrines that deserves Censure— I hope before long
							to ascertain what <persRef ref="lucretiuscarus-titus"

							the Cause falsely assigned in the English Declaration, was calculated if
							believed by Russia to be true, to make Russia take an interest in the
							War, in favour of England, and against my Country— That the main effort
							of the Regent’s State Paper, was to inculcate the belief that the Causes
							assigned in the American Declaration were mere pretences, and that
							America had commenced the War under the influence, and in subserviency
							to the policy of France. This I affirmed to be absolutely false— I had
							officially communicated to him the Count the Views of the American
							Government with regard to France, at the time of the Declaration of War—
							It was not true that our quarrel with England had been produced by any
							operation of French influence— It was a question which we had to settle
							with England alone, and a question without settlement of which I did not
							believe it possible that Peace should be made— I added that although the
							English Answer to our Declaration had thus been published here at full
							length, the Declaration itself had not; and my principal object was to
							ask him, whether I could have translations of our Manifesto now
							published in the same papers which had given circulation to the Answer—
							The Count said, by all Means— That the introductory remark which I had
							noticed, as having been published with the English Regent’s Declaration
							was altogether wrong— That he did not know that it was in the paper;
							though he must acknowledge it was his fault that it was there— Supposing
							that the Declaration only was in the paper, and being overwhelmed with
							these newspapers, which they were perpetually bringing to him to read,
							he had stopp’d them from reading this document to him, and by that
							accident the remark had escaped his attention— That if I would send him
							translations of the American Declaration, they should be immediately
							published in the same Gazettes where the English Answer had appeared—
							That it was by no means the intention of Russia to take a side or
							constitute herself a judge in the War between the United States and
							England— That his own opinion was that I had truly stated the fact that
							the question was between America and England, altogether independent of
							any French influence— But from the same disposition not to take a part
							in this question, he wished me to send him the Translations of our
							Manifesto without any Commentary— I replied that this was my wish— I had
							abstained from every step that could bear even the construction of
							attempting to disturb the friendly relations between Russia and Britain—
							And all I asked was that the same measure should be meted out to us— I
							had indeed observed several indications of endeavours here to warp the
							public opinion here on the side of the English in their contest with us,
							but I had never much dreaded their effect, and had not thought them
							worthy of notice untill this occurrence— I assured him that I would send
							him the translations, as soon as I could have them made out— We then
							touched upon the subject of general European Politics, upon which I
							found the Count evidently dissatisfied with the present course of
							affairs— He expressed himself in terms but partially intelligible to me—
							He said it was now quite a fashion, to talk, as if there was but one
							object of attention in the affairs of Europe; and that one object was a
							single man— For his part he firmly believed that Providence would make
							the experiment of taking away the man, and leaving the world to see how
							they could settle their questions without him. As for himself, he was
							persuaded that if Providence had kept this little incident in reserve,
							after the first moment of rapturous joy should be ov<unclear>er</unclear> the world would
							be quite astonished to find itself as far from a state of harmony as
							ever, and with all its sources of discord, and additional new ones, to
							settle. I told the Count I had been much struck with the same remark of
							the general disposition to concentrate upon one individual man all the
							warfare and all the politics of the time— I believed with him that the
							man would be taken away and the questions would remain. But I consoled
							myself with reflecting upon the part which Russia was obviously called
							to take, in the present state of the world, and with the Confidence I
							had in the extent of her power, and the Moderation of her views— The
							Count replied that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> was
							so accessible, by the goodness of his character, and then checked
							himself, without finishing the sentence.— It was absolutely necessary
							that there should be somebody to assume the office of regulator in this
							state of affairs— Somebody who should give the impulse to the system of
							futurity— He did not say it must be the Emperor of Russia, or speak as
							his Chancellor; but nothing could ensue but confusion, if as seemed now
							very much the tendency of things, the policy and the will of Europe
							w<unclear>as</unclear> <pb n="471" type="ms"/>was if he might so express himself, thrown
							into a Republic— Every one would have his project, and no two of them
							reconcileable with each other. The present tendency was to throw every
							thing into the popular channel— Every thing was to be done by popular
							movements— It was in substance a return of Jacobinism— <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> might be considered as
							the <persRef ref="donquixote">Don Quixote</persRef> of Monarchy— He had
							to be sure overthrown many Monarchs; but he had done nothing against
							Monarchy— By affecting to make his person the only object of hostility,
							and by setting the populace at work to run him down, there would be a
							foundation laid for many future and formidable disorders— According to
							the principles of the antient diplomacy, it was a rule that every State
							must be negotiated with upon the basis of its interests and its powers—
							It would have been thought absurd to aim at obtaining from any one what
							he had not to give— For instance no one would have applied to an order
							of mendicant friars for a grant of money. Every one was to be dealt with
							according to his means, and that was to be required of him which he had
							to supply— Now it was to be all common concern, and all man and woman
							kind was to mingle in the deliberations. He asked me if I had seen
								<persRef ref="schlegel-auguste">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Schlegel’s</persRef> pamphlet— I knew nothing even of the man— He
							said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Schlegel was a gentleman who had
							been here with <persRef ref="stael-anne">Madame de Stael</persRef>,
							and was still with her at Stockholm— A pamphlet had lately been
							published, ostensibly by him, though without his name— Madame de Stael
							he supposed was not the author of it; but he believed she had given it
							quelques coups de brosse— It professed in the title page to be printed
							at Hamburg, but had really been printed at Stockholm— He had received
							two copies of it from <persRef ref="vansuchtelen-jan">General Van
								Suchtelen</persRef> (the Russian Minister in Sweden) and he would
							give me one of them; (which he did.) requesting only that I would not
							mention having received it from him— He said, with regard to its
							contents that he totally differed from the opinions it contained; and
							was much like Madame de Stael herself— She was a perfect sample of
							French women— It was impossible for a human mind to have more wit and
							vivacity; but such was the extreme mobility of her imagination, and such
							the inconsistency of her ideas, that in the result of every conversation
							you have with her it is the same thing as if you had been talking <hi
								rend="italic">avec une folle</hi>.— I told the Count I had had the
							honour of two Conversations with her when she was here; and that in them
							she had given me the measure of her political system— It was personal
							resentment against Napoleon, because he had treated her ill— The Count
							laughed, and reminded me of the anecdote about <persRef
								ref="desevigne-francoise">Madame de Sevigné</persRef>, <persRef
									ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. and <persRef ref="derabutin-roger">Bussy-Rabutin</persRef>— I mentioned
							the new Proclamation of <persRef ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18</persRef> to
							the French People, and asked the Count, if it was known to have produced
							any effect in France— He said it was a good Proclamation; and he had no
							doubt would à la longue produce very considerable effects; though
							perhaps not immediately— It was certain that never since the
							Commencement of the French Revolution, had there been so general a
							removal of all the obstacles to the return of the Bourbons as there was
							at present; and he had long been of opinion that it would end sooner or
							later in their restoration— He had often said, and yet believed it would
							finally come to the king of the Almanac Royal— That is, he would not say
							that Louis 18 would be restored; or his brother the <persRef
								ref="artois-charles">Comte d’Artois</persRef>— He would not promise
							that the <persRef ref="louisantoine2">Duke d’Angoulême</persRef>, or
							even that the <persRef ref="artois-charles2">Duke de Berri</persRef>
							would ever come to the throne— It was impossible to ascertain the time
							when, or the individual in whom the restoration would be accomplished;
							but the Crown would eventually fall upon the lawful head, just as the
							succession would be arranged in the Almanack.— [“]There is yet however
							much to struggle through,[”] added the Count, [“]and even now, <hi
								rend="italic">our political successes</hi>, will tend much to
							strengthen and consolidate his power internally.— France could have had
							nothing to fear directly from Russia— Even had Russia harboured hatred
							against France, which she does not, she is too distant; she can have no
							purposes of encroachment upon France. The nation therefore could feel
							but a feeble interest in a War against Russia— But now, on one side
							(Prussia) we have had a complete political success— We may have success
							equally complete on the other part. (Austria.) France will be thus put
							on the defensive, and must contend for her own territories— This no
							doubt will give new energy to her exertions, and will interest the
							Nation more in him whose cause will be thus identified with their own.
							We must wait to know the results”— On leaving the Count I called at
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris’s</persRef>, to enquire if he could tell me of persons who
							could make <unclear>go</unclear>od French, Russian and German Translations of our
							Manifesto’s.— He named a person for the French, and said he would obtain
							information with regard to the others— I attended at the sale of Books,
							and bought several— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris spent the

							season since the <pb n="472" type="ms"/>year 1803 and in the last
							ninety-five years not more than nine or ten times. The earliness of the
							Spring has been proportioned to the severity of the Winter— After I came
							home I finished reading the fourth Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> de Finibus— It is the refutation in his own name,
							of the Stoic doctrine on this question which had been set forth by Cato
							in the preceding Book— He insists that the opinion of the Stoics was the
							same as that of the Academy, in substance, and that they had only
							introduced some unnecessary new terms— <persRef ref="catoyounger"
								>Cato</persRef> pretends that there was a great difference between
							them not only of words but of things— Cicero as might be expected has
							the best of the argument— There is some subtlety and even some obscurity
							in their reasoning on both sides, which is noticed by Cicero— He tells
							Cato, that he will not attack his philosophy as he had done in the
							Oration for Murena; for that he was then speaking to ignorant people,
							and adapted his discourse to their Understandings— On the whole it
							appears that the difference between the Stoics and the Academics on the
							nature of good and evil were mere disputes upon words— The Stoics held
							that the terms <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
								>Evil</hi> had reference solely and exclusively to the condition of
							the Soul and none to that of the body— That nothing was good but what
							was honest, and nothing evil but the dishonest. That sickness, poverty,
							loss of friends, children, and life were no Evils, and that in bodily
							pleasure, riches, honours, and every thing except Virtue there was
							nothing that deserved to be called good— They admitted however that all
							these things were such that wise men would prefer the latter to the
							former— The academicians allowed that the honest was incomparably the
							greatest of Good things and the dishonest the greatest of Evils— But
							that the Body was the subject of good and evil as well as the soul,
							because man was a being compounded of body and Soul— The doctrine of the
							Academy seems to me the most correct, and yet that of the Stoics had a
							tendency to sublimer Virtue, and more heroic action.</p>

								>Olivet’s</persRef> translation of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> first Tusculan disputation— There are five—On
							Death—Pain—Affliction—the Passions and Virtue— The first second and

								ref="bouhier-jean">Bouhier</persRef>— They are addressed to <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>, and avowedly in the Socratic
							form of Dialogue— He supposes a conference at Tusculum between himself
							and a man of straw whom he is to refute and convince— It is not an
							alternate discussion like the Books on Good and Evil, where each side
							supports its doctrine with all its arguments; but a mere statement of
							positions by one party, with an elaborate argument by the other— Thus in
							the first Tusculan, after an introduction exposing the plan of the work,
							addressed to Brutus, he makes his interlocutor begin thus “I think death
							an evil.” Upon which Cicero assumes to prove the contrary— <pb n="473"
								type="ms"/>He draws his principal reasoning from the immortality of
							the Soul, which he accordingly labours to prove, and does prove as far
							as it can be shewn by the light of Nature— The drift of the discourse
							very strongly resembles that of <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> in the Phaedo, from which he makes several long
							quotations— There appears some superfluous exertion to shew that Death
							is not an Evil, to the Dead, the contrary being too absurd to be
							affirmed by any body accustomed to philosophical discussion. The natural
							horror of Death will always be more than a match for Philosophy— It is
							perhaps impossible to prove Death an Evil; but it is certainly
							impossible to feel that it is not.</p>

							for an Ambassador, had peculiar distinctions shewn him, by the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> command; not without giving
							offence to <unclear>th</unclear>e other Ministers— But he assumed and was allowed always
							to take the place next to the Ambassador— Blome’s pretensions were not
							then formally opposed, although they were particularly noticed, and
							contested by all the other Ministers— But since the change of politics
							at this Court Blome has not ventured to push his way before others, and
							has often been at the lowest place— When I first came here <persRef
								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maisonneuve</persRef> told me that the rule established here was the
							Pell-Mell—but that sometimes Ministers, and more commonly Ambassadors
							would not submit to the rule— The only reason why <persRef
								ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef> and Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien had not the formal character of
							Ambassadors was to avoid contesting the precedence with the French
							Ambassador— In all these controversies I have endeavoured to consider it
							as an affair in which I as an <hi rend="italic">American</hi> Minister
							had no concern— And that my only principle is to dispute upon precedence
							with nobody— After returning home I was engaged with newspapers untill
							dinner time— Walked in the Evening, and read a few pages in <persRef
								ref="paley-william">Paley’s</persRef> Natural Theology— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> <unclear>om</unclear>itted his reading this

							and the Captain and the Devil— Chinese Shadows, very bad— Slight of hand
							tricks, tumblers, and one slack-rope dancer, all equally wretched; the

							and finished the perusal of <persRef ref="paley-william"
								>Paley’s</persRef> Natural Theology— His argument points not to a
							Creator, but only to a fabricator mundi, and he professedly views its

							and his style is clear, neat, and popular— Sometimes elegant, and rarely
							eloquent— Never highly animated, but generally mild and persuasive.</p>

								>Charles</persRef> and saw two more of the exhibitions at the
							Gachellies—the first was the Chinese Shadows and Arabian fire, and the
							second Rope-dancing, on the slack-rope and tumbling; together with a man
							one of whose legs and feet were deformed—shaped like an arm and foot— He
							used the foot as a third hand— Ate, drank and played on the violin with
							it— And by attaching one cymbal to the side of his other leg, he played
							with two pair of cymbals at once— These two sets of performers were
							better than those we had seen yesterday and I do not recollect to have
							seen the last of them before— I dined at <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef> with a company
							of about 35 persons— Russian Officers and the foreign Ministers. There
							was much news, though none official. The taking of Thorn is known by a
							letter from the <persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">Duke of Oldenburg</persRef> to the
								<persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="lowenhielm-gustaf">Count Löwenhielm</persRef> told me he had
							the protest of the 34 Members of Congress, in the Minority, against the
							War, and promised to send it to me— He spoke of it in terms of high
							approbation— <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> next to
							whom I sat at dinner appeared to have recovered his Spirits again, and
							has become as warm an adversary to <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Bonaparte</persRef>, as any man I see— He told me that he had seen
							his speech on closing the Session of the Legislative Assembly—in which
							not one word was said of the defection of Prussia— But he said he should
							very soon go in person and place himself at the head of his army— I
							asked where his army was— Blome said he did not know. He had also said
							in the speech that the Department of the Mouths of the Elbe had been
							offered to Denmark, as an indemnity for Norway—(meaning I suppose,
							offered by England and Russia)— I said that part of Hanover was in that
							Department— Oh! said Blome—it is only <hi rend="italic">he</hi> says so,
							and what he says deserves no credit— In this case it is only <hi
								rend="italic">partly true</hi>— Partly true it therefore is— The
							Hanseatic Cities are not likely to be long lived— I walked in the
							Evening, and we afterwards played at Loto.</p>
