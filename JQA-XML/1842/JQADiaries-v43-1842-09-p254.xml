						<p><persRef ref="brown-thomas2">Thomas H. Brown</persRef> is an old invalid
							petitioner for a pension who came to enquire what had been done with his
							petition— I told him it had been presented, and referred to the proper
							committee, and would be on the files for the action of the house at the
							next Session of Congress. <persRef ref="leach-jesse">Jesse
								Leach</persRef>, comes from Rockville— Was a Sadler by trade, and
							from religious impulses involved himself in debt to the amount of
							several thousand dollars, from which he has been for several years
							unable to extricate himself. The expense was incurred by the erection of
							an episcopal church at Rockville; and it has reduced him to the
							necessity of soliciting contributions for his relief— He has several
							warm recommendations from charitable gentlemen besides those who have
							contributed themselves— I called at the Treasury Department— The
							Secretary, <persRef ref="forward-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walter Forward</persRef> has been several weeks absent, at the
							Bedford Springs, convalescent from a bilious fever— I read from the
							National Intelligencer, and the Globe the reports of the passage through
							the house of the joint resolution from the Senate appropriating 6000
							dollars for the expense of liberating Citizens of the United States,
							from Mexican captivity taken as Texan prisoners of War, in the
							expedition against Santa Fe last Summer; and desired him particularly to
							mark my earnest and repeated remonstrances against it, as
							unconstitutional. I said I knew not whether the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> had signed the resolution or
							not, but I objected to the drawing of any money from the Treasury under
							its authority— I requested <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Clintock Young</persRef> the Chief
							Clerk to inform the President of my objection; and to say that I wished
							to give no unnecessary trouble to the Department, or notoriety to the
							transaction, and would be satisfied with an assurance that no money
							should be drawn from the Treasury upon this resolution before the next
							Session—but I should otherwise address and publish a Letter to the
							Secretary of the Treasury on the subject— I went to the General
							Post-Office with a Letter from <persRef ref="murdock-jesse">Jesse
								Murdock</persRef> about the Post-Office at Carver— The <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-charles">Postmaster General</persRef> was so much

								<persRef ref="fuller-philo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philo C.

							he would return it to me, and enable me to answer it— He said there was
							a complaint from a Post-master at Augusta, Maine that M<hi

							franking at Carver, without commission— I requested that I might be
							furnished with a written statement to that effect that I might make it

						<p>My mind is in the condition of a ship at Sea in a hurricane suspended by
							an instantaneous calm. The brain heaves— The head swims— The body
							totters, and I live in a perpetual Waltz— The presentiment of a sudden
							termination to my life is rather cheering to me, than painful, and a man
							conscious of no sin upon his soul, which repentant tears could wash out,
							may wash out, can dispense with the deprecation of the episcopal litany
							against sudden death— The apprehension how ever of such a close to my
							life ought to, and does admonish me to set my house in order, to be
							prepared as much as a prudent forecast can provide for whatever event
							may by the will of God befall me— I see my duty—but I procrastinate— I
							had determined to devote the interval between the Session of Congress
							just closed and the next, in all probability the last I shall ever
							attend, in settling all my private concerns so that I may be ready for
							the summons at a minute’s notice to appear before my maker, but I have
							not felt myself at liberty to decline engagements to attend two public
							meetings in my own district, and to address them; and last Evening I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J.
								Pearce</persRef> of Newport, Rhode-Island indicted for Treason
							against the State soliciting my aid in his defence— I could not hesitate
							an instant to undertake it, though it comes upon me like a thunder-clap—
							No one can imagine what I suffered, when I engaged to defend before the
							Supreme Court of the United States the lives and liberty of 36 Africans
							of the Amistad, nor with what gratitude to heaven, I heard the decision
							of the Court pronouncing them free— And with what delight I dwelt upon
							the confident hope that it was the last occasion upon which I should
							ever be called to stake my personal, moral, intellectual and political
							character upon issues involving the lives, fortunes, and characters of
							others as well as my own— I have now on hand a controversial warfare
							with <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef> President of the
							United States; bitter personal hatred of five of the most depraved, most
							talented, and most influential men of this Country, four of them open

						<p>The heat and the depression of my Spirits continue unabated—perhaps in
							the relation of cause and effect— I called at the Department of State
							and saw the Chief Clerk <persRef ref="webster-fletcher">Fletcher
								Webster</persRef>. <persRef ref="webster-daniel">His father the
								Secretary of State</persRef> is gone to spend a month at Marshfield—
							I enquired if there was among the acts of the Session of Congress just
							expired deposited at the Department, a joint Resolution appropriating
							6000 dollars of money. He said there was; sent a clerk for it, and put
							it into my hands— It was signed—Approved—<persRef ref="tyler-john">John
								Tyler</persRef>— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster,
							to say to the President that I protested against the drawing of any
							money from the Treasury under authority of that Resolution, which I
							considered unconstitutional null and void— I had remonstrated against it
							in vain at every stage of its passage through the house— Introduced from
							the Senate, within the last half hour of the Session; without a word of
							reason or of explanation—driven through by repeated previous questions,
							and for an expenditure itself very exceptionable, I had notified
								<persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Young</persRef> Chief Clerk of the Treasury, that I proposed to move
							at the next Session of Congress to rescind that Resolution— That if I
							could be assured no money would be drawn from the Treasury under its
							authority, I would take no further notice of it, but I would otherwise
							address to the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> and publish a Letter stating my objections
							against it— I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher Webster
							the paragraphs of the Constitution which I understand to interdict the
							appropriation of money by Resolution, and requested him to state them to
							the President and to communicate to me his decision upon the subject
							before next Tuesday, when I expected to leave the City. He said he
							would— This profligate and outrageous violation of the Constitution
							imposes upon me duties of bitter anguish and hopeless prospect. I called
							twice, at <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse’s</persRef> Office,
							and was compelled to give up my intention to reinvest 1200 dollars of
							Treasury Notes of which I received payment; in April and June last— At
							the Clerk’s Office of the House of Representatives I received the minute
							of Petitions presented by me during the recent Session and of the
							Committees to which they were referred. I bespoke the printed sheets of
							the remnant of the Journals of both houses, as they will be published,
							and in the Library of Congress gave a cursory perusal to <persRef
								ref="swift-jonathan">Swift’s</persRef> Contests and Dissensions in
							Athens and Rome; but found not there what I had expected— At the Office
							of the National Intelligencer <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi

							Smithsonian bequest Bill, with which nothing can be done till the next

						<p>Morning worship at the Presbyterian Church, where <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane p</persRef>reached—the same who
							ministered in the same pulpit last Sunday— His text this morning was
							from Hebrews 11.6. [“]But without faith it is impossible to please him:
							for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a
							rewarder of them that diligently seek him—” A Sermon upon Faith— my
							thunder— How few educated Christians are there but believe that God is—
							Alas! how much fewer who square their lives by that belief— I believe
							that God is—but I live as if he was not— Conduct is the result of
							impulse, far more than of belief— All religious profession passes with
							the world for hypocrisy or imbecility, or both— The Apostle says that he
							who cometh to God must believe that he is a rewarder of them that
							diligently seek him— A rewarder? must we then like <persRef
								ref="falstaff-john">Falstaff</persRef> follow for the reward? Is
							there—can there be any merit in seeking diligently, or in following for
							the reward— The disinterested love of God is a doctrine of the
							Hopkinsian creed; but I believe there is no such thing in human nature—
							I reverence God as my Creator—As creator of the world. I reverence him
							with holy fear— I venerate Jesus Christ as my redeemer; and as far as I
							can understand, the redeemer of the world— But this belief is dark and
							dubious— The worship of God is a tribute of the heart—but worship can do
							no good to him— Worship for reward is the virtue of a sycophant
							disinterested worship is inanity— The Indian Savage deprecates the
							malevolence of his deity— So does the Christian trembler, when he says
							it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God— After
							dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity and preached from Philippians 3.17. [“]Brethren, be followers
							together of me, and mark them which walk so, as ye have me for an
							ensample (omit the verses in brackets 18 and 19) For our conversation is
							in Heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
							Christ.”— I called after church at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> house,
							but he was not at home— I am obliged to hasten my preparations for
							departure, and to occupy much of the Sunday with the business of the
							week— Evening visitors to take leave, <persRef ref="king-charles2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> the painter, <persRef

							and his daughter <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary</persRef>— In rummaging
							over my files of papers, I found among them those of <persRef

							I found the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary Walter
								Forward</persRef>, returned last evening from his excursion to the

							papers of <persRef ref="miller-samuel3">Samuel N. Miller</persRef>,
							which I had found yesterday among my files; and also the Petition from
								<persRef ref="newcomb-george2">George Newcomb</persRef> and others
							for the bounty upon their fishing Schooner which was lost, and the

							said he would give to both cases deliberate consideration, I spoke to
							him of the joint resolution appropriation—told him the manner in which
							it had been swindled through both Houses of Congress; and my objections
							against it, as unconstitutional, null and void— He promised to look into
							it very seriously; but the deed is done— I received this day an
							impertinent Letter from <persRef ref="webster-fletcher">Fletcher
								Webster</persRef>, bloated with self, sufficiency as an Executive
							Officer, maintaining that an appropriation by Resolution is quite as
							proper and valid as if made by Law, and that he has already made the
							requisition at the Department of the Treasury for the 6000 dollars
							appropriated by the Resolution— Fletcher Webster, the first exploit of
							whose manhood was to debauch and get with child his own cousin under the
							desecrated protection of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">his
								father’s</persRef> roof is by that same father’s appointment chief
							clerk, and now acting Secretary of the Department of State, strutting
							about with all the insolence of Office, and blundering on with all the
							ignorance of an unschooled boy— He says in his Letter that there are
							numerous precedents of this course— I answered him this Evening, and
							called for a specification of his numerous precedents— I went also to
							the Capitol, and examined the journal of the Senate; and traced up the
							fraud to the South-Carolina Senator, <persRef ref="preston-william2">W.
								C. Preston</persRef>, connived at by <persRef ref="evans-george2"

							or found its reward at Tyburn— And Preston and Evans are two of the

								>Captain Carbery’s</persRef>, on a lease for ten years at 150
							dollars a year rent—the first years rent to be expended by him in

							appears to be not much better that my own; but he is ten years younger,
							and says he has enjoyed good health all his life. I was engaged the

							and most anxious vigilance, and by keeping a written account of every
							cent of expenditure to keep my expenses always within my income since I
							was cast back from the President’s Office upon my own resources, but of
							all the trials incidental to the retirement of a man from a scale of

						<p>I was very unwell all day yesterday, with a dull headache and a dejected
							spirit, under the rank and I fear irrecoverable degeneracy of the
							present age— Irretrievable because it has infected the whole body of the
							people— I had towards evening some feverish symptoms but I had a good
							night’s rest, awoke a quarter before a church bell clock rang four, and
							having no conveniences for writing, lay till five when after a suitable
							time I roused my family; and taking a hack for my family walked down the
							Street to the Steamer for Bordentown— I met in the passage way between
							the barroom and the outer street door, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henshaw</persRef> of Boston, who told
							me that he left Boston—had seen <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my
								Son</persRef>, the day before, and he was well—but that <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> was at the point of
							death with the Dysentery— We started in the steamer at precisely at 7.
							with about 500 fellow passengers, some 300 of whom were bound upon an
							excursion of pleasure to New-York and thence out in a Steamer, round the
							harbour and bay and islands— They had a band of music, consisting of
							seven brothers and two or three besides, who entertained us with
							frequent symphonies, and for the first time in my life a Serenade of
							music annoyed me— They say they have these excursion parties once a week
							through the Summer Season from Philadelphia—and they proceed, swelling
							in numbers as they go on— Men, matrons and maidens, joining the party at
							Burlington, Bristol and Bordentown, whence they started in a train of
							thirty or forty Cars, which were in attendance to receive them, for
							Amboy and we saw no more of them— From Bordentown we proceeded through
							Trenton, Princeton, New-Brunswick, Elizabeth-town, Newark, over the
							Hackinsack and Passaic rivers to the ferry in Jersey city formerly
							Paulus Hoek— I took a hack to carry us from the landing of New-York,
							about a quarter of a mile, for which the driver made me pay him two
							dollars— His name was <persRef ref="u">Develin</persRef>, and I told him
							I should remember it— We stop’d at the City Hall and dined there, but
							the house has sadly fallen off— The dinner was very indifferent— I took
							passage in the Steamer Massachusetts, <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Comstock</persRef>, which I expected would from Stonington proceed
							round by Newport to Providence, and I intended to land at Newport— But
							of all the days of the week it happens that the trip of this day is the
							only one when she does not go round— We left <persRef ref="cutts-mary"
								>Miss Cutts</persRef> at the City Hotel, to go up this Evening by

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickinson</persRef>, mother of
								<persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Benjamin O. Tayloe</persRef>, who is with her. We embarked in the
							Massachusetts, and cast off from battery pier N. 1. precisely at 5. P.M.
							The weather, had been again all day warm fair but gathering clouds from
							the morning, and by the time we had worked round Sands’s point the
							premonitors of a North easter were discernible.</p>

						<p>There were 350 passengers in the Massachusetts, and no extraordinary

							were <persRef ref="bayard-richard">James A Bayard</persRef>. U.S.

								Percival</persRef> of the Navy. a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Smith</persRef> who has heretofore repeatedly invited me to deliver
							a lecture before the Boston Lyceum, and now urged the same request, not
							without importunity. Many other persons came and claimed old
							acquaintance with me, of which I had no recollection, or professed a
							desire to shake hands with John Quincy Adams, of whom they had heard and
							read so much and so often— “Can flattery sooth the dull cold ear of
							death?[”] I had little temptation for making a long evening of
							conversation, and there was none that occurred between others in which I
							took any interest— The atmosphere was becoming damp and chilly, and at 8
							O’Clock I turned into my berth— I slept till 11. and then awoke with a
							head-ache, and feverish symptoms, and utter in impotence of continuous
							thoughts— I lay ruminating till one of the morning, and then rose and
							went upon deck to breathe fresh air— The Falkner’s Island light had just
							been passed, and was in sight from the Starboard side of the boat— A
							sharp North-eastern breeze was freshening to a gale, with a sprinkling
							in the air not amounting to rain. There were numerous persons, men women
							and children, who had not been able to procure berths, and who were
							flitting about in the darkness on the deck like uneasy ghosts in
							Tartarus— The boat was making slow progress against wind and tide—and
							the time was come when with fair wind and weather she would have almost
							within reach of the wharf at Stonington— I returned to my berth, and lay
							sleepless till at a quarter past 3. when the bell roused the passengers
							for landing— We landed at a quarter before four, the North east gale
							being then in full blast, and the rain driving in streams.— The company
							was so numerous that a full half hour was consumed in transferring the
							baggage from the boat to the crate, and in getting all the passengers
							seated— The cars then proceeded 60 miles to Providence, through
							Hopkinton, South-Kingston and East-Greenwich and we crossed the ferry;
							the storm blowing and streaming without abatement: and the swiftest
							sharks devouring all the breakfast in the boat, while the rest sealed a
							truce with their appetites— We entered the cars at Providence, and
							passing through the towns of Rehoboth, Mansfield, Sharon, Canton, Dedham
							and Roxbury, landed at half past nine at Boston, the storm still driving
							and so cold that I was fain to resort to both my surtout and Cloak for
							comfort. I took a hack which brought us to Quincy—home— <persRef

							promised to examine the case and inform me of his decision upon it. I
							had myself doubts of the power of the Secretary to allow the bounty on

						<p><persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, my cousin came out
							from Boston last Evening to stay with us, till we return to Washington
							next November— At the stone Temple the <persRef ref="brazer-john">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brazer</persRef>, of Salem preached this morning from Psalm 19.12.
							“Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.” an
							excellent moral discourse. There is no deeper or more difficult study
							than that of our own secret faults. Secret even to ourselves, for there
							is no hypocrisy so base as that with which we deceive ourselves, and no
							weakness more deplorable than that with which we appease our consciences
							by indulging the faults which we cannot disguise from ourselves— It is
							perhaps not possible to trace in the Psalms of <persRef ref="david"
								>David</persRef> the train of thought that constitutes the unity of
							each Psalm— This one begins by announcing that the Sun and Moon are the
							irrefragable evidence of the glory of God.— This is Persian Theology and
							must be natural religion. Then there is a poetical description of the
							Sun riding daily round the globe with the exultation of a Bridegroom—
							Then there is an instantaneous transition from the physical to the moral
							world and a magnificent tribute to the Law of God— All moral virtue is
							then ascribed to the <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of God—but the question
							occurs who can understand his errors? and immediately an appeal is taken
							to the Mercy of God, to cleanse the psalmist from secret faults—to which
							he adds a suplication for delivery from presumptuous sins and closes
							with a general petition that the words of his mouth and the meditation
							of his heart may be acceptable in the sight of the Lord, his strength
							and his redeemer— Is this not the very consummation of the spirit of
							prayer? Would not the perfection of human virtue consist in making the
							whole idea of this Psalm an exemplification of a man’s whole life? M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazer’s afternoon sermon was from Matthew
							19.29. [“]And every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren, or
							sisters or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
							names sake shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting
							life.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brazier guarded against the
							misapprehension of a construction which would actually require the
							abandonment of all those objects— on returning home from church this
							afternoon I found here <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> P. P. F. Degrand</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="derby-elias">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. H.
								Derby</persRef>, who took teas and spent the Evening here. <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							paid us an evening visit— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> who was confined all day yesterday to her bed, was up
							and about again this day; but quite unwell, and with feverish symptoms
							yet upon her. Degrand as usual brought out a budget of Newspapers.</p>

							address me—and offer a series of Resolutions— I have no time for

						<p><persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, went into Boston
							yesterday with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>, and
							returned here last Evening— Yesterday was one of the most summer sultry
							days of the year. Last Evening swarmed with musquitoes and there was a
							light thunder shower— The night continued warm, I cased myself again in
							summer cloathing; but was scarcely dressed before the Eastern wind
							breezed up again— A cloudy sky. rain and a gloomy day followed— I looked
							into my seminary enclosures where my seedling fruit trees have almost
							all perished— <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George W.
								Beale</persRef> came separately and talked with me about the weather
							and the crops, and fruit, and the bees that sting the peaches to death,
							and the six cows and a horse of <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>, poisoned
							last week no one knows how—and so infectious that it poisoned every man
							that touched them—one of whom <persRef ref="u">Pickering</persRef> was
							swolen to a sight, and in a frenzy, taking three men to keep him down in
							his bed. This morning Charles’s <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>wife</persRef> went to Boston with him, and <persRef
								ref="bigelow-mary2">Miss Mary Bigelow</persRef> returned home— I
							strive to write but my physical strength deserts me, and the pen drowses
							out of my hand. At 3 this afternoon I walked to the orthodox Church, and
							heard the <persRef ref="pierpont-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								John Pierpont</persRef>, deliver an address of an hour and a half
							upon Temperance. His Style was colloquial—familiar, lowly, but not
							vulgar—occasionally ludicrous— His argument was that the trade in the
							spirituous liquors, or wine was criminal— That water was created by God,
							for animals, and among them Man, to drink— That God created nothing else
							to be drank, and that to drink any thing else is to violate the Law of
							Nature— I envied M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont his Talents— He
							drew a comparison between the three necessities of Nature, to sustain
							alike vegetable and animal life—Light air and water; and he argued that
							as they were all indispensably necessary to animal and vegetable life,
							there were furnished in quantities inexhaustable for the use of all; and
							that nothing else can supply their places— There was notice given of a
							Ladies Fair at Weymouth landing next Tuesday to aid the cause of
							Temperance and there was <unclear>ano</unclear>ther meeting of this same Society this
							evening, at which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont announced that
							he should speak again—but more briefly— Charles spent the Evening here—
							He was a member of the Committee which sat before the special meeting of
							the Legislature to prepare a bill for districting the Commonwealth,
							conformably to the apportionment act of Congress. They reported a bill
							accordingly, and after a week’s debate, it passed they house this day,
							nearly as reported by the Committee— It has yet to pass through the
							ordeal of the Senate.</p>

						<p>Never was my mind in a state of deeper agitation than at this time— I
							awoke this morning some time before two O’Clock— Sat down in my chamber
							and wrote till five O’Clock— Then returned to bed and lay sleepless till
							6. when I rose for the day— I employ what leisure I have in laying out a
							take leave speech for next Saturday. But the variety of topics upon
							which I must touch is so great, and every one of them must be so largely
							treated, that as I think and breathe upon them, they swell like soap
							bubbles, blown by boys through pipe-stems, till they burst, and resolve

							I met them again afterwards at <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house— A heavy gloom hung over my Spirits, and
							a numbness of feeling which I know not how to describe or to name—
							Immediately after dinner, I lay down on my bed and slept three hours,
							after which I was fresh and cheerful for the Evening— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Smith</persRef>
								and<space/><persRef ref="u">Field</persRef> called just at Sunset to

							before this institution and have made them several times conditional
							engagements to comply with their requests but have been always
							disappointed. I met M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith again last week
							in the Steamer from New-York to Stonington, when he besieged me again
							for the promise of a Lyceum Lecture, which I again conditionally made—
							This evening to settle the whole concern—I promised I would deliver the
							opening Lecture on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next month,
							unless some event shall occur which may put it out of my power— Charles
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> were here this
							Evening— He had returned home to dine— The house of Representatives
							having carried through and reported to the Senate their Districting
							Bill, have now nothing to do, but are awaiting the action of the Senate—
							The great whig convention for the nomination of Governor and Lieut<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Governor for the ensuing year was held in
							Boston— It is said there were one thousand persons present— Sundry
							Speeches were made—among the rest, by <persRef ref="baker-osmyn">Osmyn

								Burnell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Leverett

						<p>I awoke again by two in the morning with my old catarrhal cough and fever
							upon me as warning of what I must undertake to go through next Saturday.
							This reception was projected by two successive meetings of delegates
							from towns in the District as long ago as last June. <persRef
								ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring</persRef>
							of Hingham as Chairman of a Committee of arrangements wrote to me on the
								25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, informing me of the
							design, and requesting me to name a day for the performance— I answered
							him, and named next Saturday at 3. p.m. and since that it has been
							advertised in the Newspapers of the District and in several of the daily
							papers of Boston— All this parade and ceremony is to be made for me, and
							I only think how ridiculously it inflates my vanity. The Meeting is
							expected to be very large, but I am prepared for a disappointment in
							that— The weather is as unfavourable as possible, and I have no reason
							to expect it will be better. I know how hard it is to fill country
							Churches, and I do not desire a crowded auditory— But I am to be
							addressed face to face and to make an extemporaneous answer— I am to
							receive resolutions, and know not exactly what they will be; and must
							make some comment upon them— I am expected to make a long speech, and
							have every reason to fear it will disappoint expectations much too
							highly raised— The danger of giving offence is imminent. The power of
							compressing and arranging what I have to say is very severely tested—
							The themes are all too copious and I feel my deficiency in the art of
							abridging.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring was here this morning,
							and agreed to meet me on Saturday soon after Noon at <persRef
								ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer’s</persRef> house— He spoke also of
							a fishing party at Cohassett rocks next week, but I could not answer
							positively.— <persRef ref="brown-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Brown</persRef> of Beverly was here, and summoned me to the
							performance of what he claimed as a promise at Washington that if I
							should Lecture any where this Season beyond Quincy and Boston, it should
							be before the Lyceum at Beverly. He was very importunate with me to fix
							a day, but I could not—nor could I even make any positive engagement.
								<persRef ref="tufts-susannah">Miss Tufts</persRef> was here and
							invited us to tea at <persRef ref="tufts-mercy2">her mother’s</persRef>
							on Saturday. <persRef ref="lunt-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henry Lunt</persRef>, with <persRef ref="lunt-william">his

						<p>Another dull, gloomy, chilling, rainy North-easterly storm day.— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> called this morning for the
							order from the Bank of the Metropolis upon the Merchants Bank at Boston
							which I brought with me, but could not wait till I found it— The house
							of Representatives had adjourned to 9 O’Clock this morning, and in the
							course of the morning the Legislature was prorogued to the Tuesday
							preceding the first Wednesday in January next— That is the formulary in
							this Commonwealth, for a final adjournment for the year— At the close of
							the ordinary winter Session of the Legislature, Congress had not passed
							the apportionment Bill. The Legislature therefore appointed a special
							Session to be held on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
							month, and a joint Committee of both houses to sit during the recess,
							and prepare a Bill for districting the Commonwealth, conformably to the
							Apportionment, which should be enacted by Congress— Charles was Chairman
							of the Committee on the part of the house, of this joint Committee. They
							met a week before the Meeting of the Legislature, and prepared a bill
							dividing the Commonwealth into ten Districts conformably to the
							Apportionment act of Congress, instead of twelve, the number, which
							Massachusetts has had in the House of Representatives of the United
							States under the census of 1830— This bill has now become the Law of the
							State, having been this day been signed by <persRef ref="davis-john4"
								>Governor John Davis</persRef>, whereupon the special Session of the
							Legislature was closed by the prorogation. Charles came home to
							dinner—and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> and I
							dined with them upon the hill.— After which, Walter and I rode to
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>, and took tea with her. <persRef ref="adams-isaac"
								>Isaac Hull</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-john3">passed
								Midshipman John Quincy</persRef>, two of her Sons, and her daughter
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.</persRef> are now with
							her and constitute her family— We came home at 8. and found Charles and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> here— They spent
							the Evening here— I gave him the check of the Bank of the Metropolis for
							1500 dollars, on the Merchants Bank at Boston— I was up till passed
							midnight, writing a closing paragraph for my address to my constituents
							to-morrow— I am now as well prepared for the meeting as I could be in
							the time— It has been oppressive upon my mind beyond every thing that I
							ever endured excepting in the preparation of the argument for the
							captives of the Amistad, and for that I had abundance of time— Very few
							persons will have a conception of the depth of interest that I take in
							this Meeting— The last act of a ten years Representation of a District
							the existence of which was terminated by the new districting act of
							yesterday and which I have served during the whole term of its
							existence— The valedictory is painful— Would I were equal to the
							occasion.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="sprague-seth2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seth Sprague
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> of Duxbury, a member
							of the Senate of the State from the County of Plymouth, and a member of
							the Committee of arrangements, for the Meeting of this day called on me
							this morning and gave me to read, the Resolutions which he proposed to
							offer, and which were honorary to me, quite as much as I could desire. I
							agreed with him to meet the Committee, between 12 and 1. at <persRef
								ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer’s</persRef> house— I rode
							accordingly accompanied only by <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> and about 20 minutes to 1. found at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer’s a small number of his friends;
							and a collation; but we had taken one before we left home. Soon after
							one, the Committee came and met me at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer. The Convention having marched in procession from the
							universalist church to that of <persRef ref="perkins-jonas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins</persRef> which is of the
							congregationalist orthodox denomination— At the head of the Committee
							was <persRef ref="davis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Morton Davis</persRef> of Plymouth, a member of the
							Governor’s Council— We proceeded to the Meeting house, where M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins in his pulpit began the ceremony
							with a fervid prayer. Immediately in front of the pulpit was erected a
							stage, on which were several clergymen and magistrates, and where the
							Committee took seats, and I was myself stationed.— The house was crowded
							in all its parts, almost to suffocation. It appeared to me one solid
							mass of humanity and that there was not room for one individual more to
							creep into— The men covered the floor and the women the galleries all
							round; except apart of the front gallery reserved for a choir of
							singers— After the prayer, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis read an
							Address to the Assembled company announcing to them the object of the
							meeting, and to me, in terms, which put me to the blush, so that I was
							utterly unable to reply to them. They were intended in kindness—but in
							fulsome praise I can take no pleasure; and it always covers me with
							humiliation— I shuffled off as soon as possible all reference to my
							former services of my administration; and addressed the meeting as my
							Constituents, whom I had served for the last twelve years, and from a
							great portion if not all of whom I am now finally to part— I spoke about
							three hours from 2 to 5. O’Clock, without interruption, and without a
							moment’s flagging of attention.— I read several of the pages that I had
							written, intermingled with so much extemporaneous enlargement and
							illustration, that the discourse was at once compact and diversified—
							The introductory and concluding pages which I had written enabled me to
							begin and finish acceptably.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprague’s
							resolutions were then read and adopted without opposition— And then an
							Ode was sung written by the <persRef ref="pierpont-john">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> John Pierpont</persRef>; to the tune
							of God save the king— Very flattering, but with a <unclear>monitorial</unclear> closing
							Stanza, scarcely intelligible. The meeting was then dismissed with a
							benediction by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins— I then went with
							Walter Hellen, first to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer’s, and
							afterwards with <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Loring</persRef> to <persRef ref="tufts-mercy2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tufts’s</persRef>, and at both places
							found good company, tea coffee and other delicate refreshments. We got
							home by 8. O’Clock. <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came in soon
							after.</p>

						<p>I felt little fatigue or exhaustion yesterday after all the excitement of
							the day, and the exertion of speaking in public three hours without
							intermission, but as the evening advanced weariness came over me— The
							will to write two hours till midnight failed, and after a rather uneasy
							night, I rose this morning, with an aggravated catarrh, hoarseness of
							voice, and a sore throat which annoyed me the whole day and evening— But
							the joy of my deliverance from the burden of yesterday banishes all
							thought of pain. The Roman Catholics of this town, chiefly Irish
							labourers, and among whom <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> hold distinguished
							stations, have become so numerous that they have recently undertaken and
							accomplished the erection of a small church for publick worship— This
							morning at ten it was dedicated by <persRef ref="fenwick-benedict"
								>Bishop Fenwick</persRef>— I went with <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>, and
							witnessed the ceremony. The Bishop, one priest and two choirist boys
							were all the performers. The house contains about 500 persons, and was
							all but overflowing—full as it could hold.— The Bishop in his Mitre and
							pontificals, followed by the priest and the two boys came out from the
							vestry, passed through the aisle crowded with people, went out side of
							the church and all round it sprinkling holy water as he went— He then
							came in and on his knees consecrated the altar, after which sitting down
							in a chair fronting the auditory, without laying aside his mitre he
							delivered a discourse from 2. Paraleipominon 7.11. “Thus <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> finished the house of the Lord, and
							the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the
							house of the Lord and in his own house, he prosperously effected. 12 And
							the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard
							thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of
							sacrifice” and so to the end of the chapter— The Bishop drew a close
							parallel between the building of the Temple by Solomon and the erection
							of this church, and promised the people all the blessings which God
							promised Solomon, upon the same conditions of obedience to his will, and
							denounced the same curses against them if they should forsake God, for
							the world, the flesh and the devil— The Priest then said Mass responded
							to by a choir of good singers. He gave notice of vespers at a quarter
							past 3.— The ceremonies occupied about 3 hours— Met <persRef
								ref="morton-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="apthorp-sarah">Sarah Apthorp</persRef> there.— After
							dinner, at the stone Temple, <persRef ref="gannett-ezra">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ezra S. Gannett</persRef> preached
							from Romans 6.17. [“]But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of
							sin: but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
							delivered you 18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants
							of righteousness.”— A very earnest and anxious exhortation to
							repentance— <persRef ref="cranch-christopher">C Pearce Cranch</persRef>
							with <persRef ref="dawes-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lucy</persRef> and <persRef ref="greenleaf-mary2">M<hi

						<p>Yesterday was the only morning of 11 days since we arrived from
							Washington, upon which the Sun has risen clear.— I saw him rise from the
							S.E corner of <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house; I
							went again this morning; but he was veiled behind a cloud till about 5
							minutes after he had risen— According to the American Almanac, the Sun
							rises at Boston on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month
							at 5:45. and my chronometer is precisely one hour in advance of the
							Sun.— I had fondly hoped that after our return from home from
							Washington, and especially after that meeting with my Constituents,
							which has weighed so heavily upon my spirits, I should be indulged with
							at least a short period of repose—but I had barely returned from my 30
							minutes walk round the temple square, when a young man brought me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="spear-justin">Justin Spear</persRef> inviting
							me to attend a Pic Nic of the cold water army consisting of children in
							the western school district of this town, next Wednesday afternoon, and
							to address them. I was engaged to go to Hingham on Wednesday, and sent
							word to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Justin Spear that I was so— Then
							came <persRef ref="latham-marcus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marcus
								Latham</persRef> for a subscription of 100 dollars to which I had
							put my name in the Spring of last year for the erection of a building in
							Cambridge, where the Alumni of Harvard University may hold their
							meetings and dine, the day before commencement— He had sent me the
							subscription book, having my name in it, last week, with a polite Letter
							to remind— I went up to Charles’s house—took of him a check, on the
							merchant’s Bank at Boston, for 100 dollars, which I gave to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Latham and took his receipt in full for my
							subscription. Visit from <persRef ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi

								Bailey</persRef> is of South Weymouth and came to enquire if he
							could not obtain a pension for <persRef ref="bayley-elizabeth">his
								mother</persRef>.— I could not find the act of the late Session
							extending the provisions of the pension acts of 1836 and 1838. <persRef
								ref="shaw-william3">William Shaw</persRef> my barber came as
							President of a fire company with a subscription paper for providing
							furniture for their fire engine. <persRef ref="andrew-charles">Charles

							and <persRef ref="bagley-aaron">Aaron C. Bagley</persRef> as a deputy
							from the Lowell Lyceum inviting me to deliver introductory Lectures; in

							circular for his church— <persRef ref="adams-john3">Past Midshipman John

								John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> in the Carriage. I
							went for the aid of a dentist, and applied to <persRef
								ref="gray-thomas3">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef>, in
							Winter Street, who gave me what aid he could by scaling off the tartar,
							and tying up one of the two loose ones with a thread, but they are past
							all surgery, and serve me but as perpetual warnings to make ready for my
							final dissolution— He was an hour and a quarter in the operation, which
							was painful, and gave me no relief— I then called at <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott
								Lawrence’s</persRef> house and saw <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef>, and a
								<persRef ref="turnbull-mary2">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="turnbull-william">Major Turnbull</persRef> of Washington— M<hi

							Liberty square, which I could not find. My next visit was to <persRef
								ref="plumbe-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumbe</persRef>,
							at his National Daguerreian Gallery 76. Court Street, to which I had
							been invited by a printed card from him to take a photographic miniature

							but I engaged to go in again next Tuesday the 27<hi rend="superscript"

							then to take it.— He has a very large collection of photographs, but
							this wonderful invention of Daguerre yields but wretched portraits—for
							inferior to the Silhouette— I walked down State-street, and inspected
							the exchange with its granite pilasters which are completed; and the new
							Custom house at the head of the long wharf apparently not much more
							advanced than it was last year. I was met and accosted in the Street by
								<persRef ref="eastburn-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and to which he expressed much solicitude to receive an answer— After

						<dateline>Quincy. Wednesday 21 September 1842</dateline>
						<p><date>21. IV. </date>Wednesday</p>
						<p>Hingham— Cohasset— Hingham— Quincy—</p>
						<p>I rose at 4. and wrote till half-past 5. Went to see the Sunrise from
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, on the day
							of the equinox— It rose over <persRef ref="horton-lloyd"
								>Hortons</persRef> bake-house, chimney; but beclouded till full five
							minutes risen— Immediately after breakfasting I went, with my Son, and
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, in the
							Carry-all, and one horse, driven by <persRef ref="taryhill-philip"
								>Philip</persRef>, to <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">t</hi> Thomas Loring’s</persRef> house at
							Hingham, whence I immediately proceeded with him in his chaise to
							Cohasset; <persRef ref="thaxter-norton">Quincy Thaxter</persRef> taking
							my place in the carry-all— At half past 8 we were at the fishing hovel
							on the rock, but there was nobody there; and the boat which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring had engaged for our fishing
							party—had been taken away this morning without leave by certain gunners
							from Braintree— Another boat was however procured by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring in the course of an hour, in which
							my son and myself, with <persRef ref="brewer-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Brewer</persRef> the Editor of the
							Boston Atlas, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnes</persRef>, went out to fish for perch— The boat was very
							small, and another, somewhat larger, with a sail soon after came up, and
							we passed over into her— I was very desirous of fishing for cod; but the
							weather was lowering the boat very leaky, and there was no inclination
							to go 4 or 5 miles off from the shore as would have been necessary to
							fish successfully for cod— We kept therefore close within shore and
							changing our position twice we caught about 6 dozen of Sea perch with a
							due portion of Sculpins and pollock—one haddock, which we returned to
							its elements and one small cod which I caught— At one, upon a signal
							from the shore, we landed and dined upon a very good chowder— There were
							now about 15 persons present from Hingham, Cohasset and Boston, among
							whom were <persRef ref="greele-samuel">deacon Samuel Greele</persRef> of
							Boston, a member of the State Legislature, <persRef ref="doane-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Doane</persRef> of Cohasset and
							sundry others— We had lemonade and coffee at dinner, and a single bottle
							of Madeira wine— After dinner, a schoolmaster with his whole school;
							upwards of 30 boys and girls came from Cohasset, for the sole purpose of
							seeing J. Q. Adams—very aukward— There was a heavy shower, which
							hastened us homeward— We had an invitation to tea and for the evening at
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>,
							and we reached his house in Hingham about 5. p.m. soon after which the
							sky cleared up— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, <persRef ref="u;u">two daughters</persRef> and a
								<persRef ref="u">son</persRef> constituted M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker’s family. The Ladies received us, but soon retired and
							a party of between 30 and forty men came in succession from 5 to 8 in
							the Evening when we left them and returned as we had gone out, home to
							Quincy. Tea and Coffee with a bountiful supply of bread and butter, and
							a profuse variety of cakes were served round, and several enquiries of
							political bearing were put to me, for the purpose of drawing me out into
							loquacity, which it did very largely. Mexico and Texas formed a
							principal subject of the Conversation— The evening Temple Bell at Quincy
							was telling 9 as we approached it— <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> was here.</p>

								<persRef ref="james-george">James’s</persRef> Life of <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tolman Willey</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hutchins</persRef>— I was
							obliged to decline— A man named <persRef ref="buckminster-william"
								>Buckminster</persRef>, Editor of a weekly Newspaper published at
							Boston, called the American Ploughman, came to solicit my subscription,
							which I also declined. He thought it strange that I should be unwilling
							to patronize agriculture. An old man 80 years of age, came to see me;
							for the pleasure of having it to say that he had once in his life seen a
							President of the United States— He had a wild staring eye, and spoke
							like a man of unsettled mind— I enquired where he lived, and he said he
							had no particular place of residence, but that he had a son living and
							doing business in Boston. He finally enquired if I had any Razors that I
							wanted to have set—intimated that this was his peculiar vocation, and
							that he had a remarkably fine hone— As I cannot shave myself I had no
							occasion for this service, and he went away. <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">My son</persRef> came and we had some discourse
							respecting the final settlement of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								fathers</persRef> Estate and Execution of his last Will— All the

								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod Adams</persRef>, my brother
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">Thomas’s</persRef> youngest son who came
							of age 16 December 1838. and to whom the payment in full of the bequest
							to him, has been deferred for various considerations till this day.— My
							son is now remitting the funds to him at Washington— <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> has yet one mortgage
							of my Court Street Estate in Boston, and two bonds for the execution of
							the bequests in my father’s will—which must all be taken up before the
							settlement can be completed— For all this we made arrangements this
							day.— The weather is so rough and raw that I had no temptation to make
							an excursion round the farm, or to lounge in my garden and nursery— From
							Charles’s house, I saw the Sun set clear, precisely at 6.— I am still
							under an enormous pressure for an Address to the Norfolk County Society
							for the suppression of Intemperance, next Thursday, and for a Lecture
							before the Boston Lyceum on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next
							Month— The various avocations of the day consumed so much of it that I
							was obliged to devote to writing the Evening while my Son, and <persRef

						<p>When I last called upon my colleague <persRef ref="briggs-george">George
								N. Briggs</persRef> at Washington, where he was detained after the
							close of the late Session by a bilious fever, he gave me a warm
							invitation to the Cattle show, and fair in his county of Berkshire,
							which was to be held the first week in October— Though I had little
							expectation of being able to go, I did not refuse, and yesterday I
							received a letter from him very earnestly urging and pressing the
							invitation— I have an aversion almost amounting to abhorrence to
							attendance at all public meetings for speech making; and avoid them as I
							would a pestilence— Yet the fashion of holding them spreads and
							multiplies all over this country to such a degree that I have neither
							leisure nor quiet, and am kept on continual agitation to escape from
							them— Having engaged to deliver a Lecture at Boston on the Evening of
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October, I cannot attend at
							Pittsfield on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I wrote accordingly
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs.— The sun rose clear this
							morning, which I witnessed from the S. E. corner of <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house; there was a white
							frost on the ground and my thermometer was at 30— The day was cloudless
							in the perfection of autumnal beauty— I wrote assiduously and without
							interruption all the morning but my Industry flagged before dinner— I
							visited my garden and nursery— My seedling Oaks, shagbark walnuts,
							maples, and Baldwin apple trees are flourishing— Most of the others have
							perished. My interest in plantations languishes— The next century is
							beyond my reach— Charles brought me three quarterly accounts which must
							occupy some of my time. <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon
								Spear</persRef> was here this afternoon, enquiring whether I would
							purchase a small woodlot of <persRef ref="hardwick-henry">Henry
								Hardwick’s</persRef>, locked within mine 7 or 8 acres for which he
							asks 26 dollars an acre just shorn of its wood— I told the deacon I
							would give 20 dollars an acre for it, and I thought no more— I strolled
							out after dinner, and found Charles, with <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
								Kirk</persRef> and <persRef ref="mooney-dennis">Dennis
								Mooney</persRef> at work upon his stone wall which he is extending
							round the enlarged lot surrounding his house— While out I walked over to

								ref="greenleaf-lucy">his wife</persRef>, youthified since I saw them
							last, about this time— He is blind, deaf, cheerful, and 80 years of age—
							She is 75, twice within the last five years, supposed to be dying of a
							slow, incurable fever, and now active and apparently in health. Their
							daughters <persRef ref="dawes-lucy">Lucy Dawes</persRef>, and <persRef

								Lunt</persRef> preach this morning from John 12.43. [“]For they
							loved the praise of men, more than the praise of God.” A practical
							dissertation upon one of the infirmities of human nature which
							Christianity has by no means extirpated; and the preacher well
							admonished his auditory, when they indulge their astonishment at the
							pusillanimity of the chief rulers among the Jews, who believed in Jesus
							but dared not confess him, for fear of the Pharisees, and of being put
							out of the Synagogue, not to be too confident that they themselves would
							not under like circumstances do precisely the same— The afternoon Sermon
							was from Revelation 11.17. “Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God
							Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come”; omitting the remainder
							of the verse; “because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast
							reigned”— The subject of the discourse was Eternity as one of the
							attributes of God— The contemplation is perplexing— The only conception
							we can form of Eternity, is of Time indefinitely
							extended—past—present—future, all which necessarily implies succession,
							as succession imports <hi rend="italic">change—</hi> The power of
							omnipotence is incomprehensible otherwise than as exercised in the
							succession of time, and yet the succession of Time confounds all ideas
							of eternity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the
							communion would be administered next Sunday. My time presses upon me
							beyond endurance— In reflecting upon this address to the Society for the
							suppression of intemperance in the County of Norfolk, I have undertaken
							to trace the Scripture theory concerning Temperance as a question of
							morals.— I was engaged upon it during all the leisure of this day— We
							had evening visits from <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer;greenleaf-mary3"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Woodward</persRef>, and from <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">Archibald Campbell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="foster-john">John Foster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>— I received also this
							evening a note from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J.
								Pearce</persRef>, at the Hancock house, notifying me of his arrival
							there, and asking an interview with me to-morrow— I answered inviting
							him to breakfast with me to morrow Morning.— The engagement that I have
							contracted to defend him before the Superior Court of the State of
							Rhode-Island, upon an indictment for Treason, is one of those
							distressing and humiliating incidents of my Life, which seem to come
							upon me, as by a fatality, to bring home to my bosom the conviction how
							far beyond my strength they are.</p>

							duly elected there to according to the Laws of the State, but under a
							pretended Constitution of Government— The second Count charges that he
							with other false traitors to the jurors unknown, did assemble, and vote
							and assent to sundry Laws and acts of pretended legislation— The third
							count charges assembling with others, not being duly elected to exercise
							the Legislative authority—and the fourth has the same charge, with the
							addition of the pretended constitution— The date of the offence charged
							in the first and fourth count is the third, and in the second and third
							Counts the fourth of May. 1842 In the event of a trial, which is quite

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce wished me to act as his

							started between us concerning the Law of Treason as arising from the
							case— But we had not time to go largely into them. There was one as to
							the legality of holding the trial at Newport; but this he said would be
							decided next week— <persRef ref="bradley-charles">M<hi

							Gallery to have my photograph taken— They took me forthwith up to the
							top of the house, where a sort of round house has been erected, with
							windows like those of a green house, and with a door opening to let in
							the Sun. I took a seat at the corner of a Settee so that the light of
							the Sun came obliquely on the side of my face. There was a small
							telescope nearly in front of me pointed directly at me, and at a
							corresponding angle on the other side a mirror— a tin or metallic plate
							was fitted into the telescope, and on that metallic plate the
							photographic impression was made. Not more than two minutes were
							required for each impression to be taken during which I was required to
							keep my head immovable, looking steady at one object. They kept me there
							an hour and a half, and took seven or eight impressions, all of them
							very bad—for an exposition of sleep came over me, and I found it utterly
							impossible to keep my eyes open for two minutes together. I dosed and
							the picture was asleep— I gave it up in despair— How the impression is

								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>—which I note now,

							visits from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef>, President of Harvard University with <persRef
								ref="quincy-eliza">his wife</persRef>— He spoke of the Observatory

							procured at Munich in Germany, and the instrument to be made in London—
							He mentioned also the new building for the annual meetings of the Alumni
							the first of which took place the day before the last Commencement.
								<persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef> delivered the

							in procession to my house, and I am to proceed with them to a pavilion,
							under which is to be a cold collation, after which we are to proceed to
							the Universalist Meeting house, and there, I am to deliver my Address—to
							be succeeded by other speakers— To all this I agreed; although the

							had written—aware that it will suit neither the passions, prejudices,

						<p>Sun rose 5.54. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 40.</p>
						<p>It was near noon before I finished the writing of my temperance address—
							Received morning visits from the <persRef ref="colver-nathaniel">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Colver</persRef>, a baptist minister, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							theological institution at Newtown, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Green</persRef>— Soon after 12.
							O’Clock there came to my house a procession of about 500 persons, with a
							band of music and the <persRef ref="pierce-john">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> John Pierce</persRef> of Brookline
							D.D. at their head. I met them at my gate; and he said he had been this
							morning elected President of the Norfolk County Temperance Society; and
							that they had come to escort me to the pavilion where they were to dine—
								<persRef ref="spear-justin">Justin Spear</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="newcomb-george2">George Newcome</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="cornell-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> William M.

							and the <persRef ref="gregory-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								John Gregory</persRef>, Minister of the Universalist church, were in
							the procession— We marched, sonorous metal blowing martial sounds to the
							pavilion adjoining the Town hall in Coddington Street, to which the Town
							hall itself has been since last winter removed— Under the pavilion, a
							cold dinner or collation was prepared on a trident table of several
							hundred covers; every plate of which was occupied, with a profusion of
							pitchers full of cold water to drink— <persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pierpont</persRef> said grace
							before meat, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colver returned thanks;
							No toasts after dinner, but much discussion whether there should be or
							not— The dinner lasted about an hour, and the procession then proceeded
							to the Universalist Meeting house, which the pilgrims of the procession
							filled to the brim The discourses were all delivered in the pulpit— They
							were interspersed with the singing of Temperance hymns— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce presided. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pierpont made the introductory prayer— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierce then gave a Sentiment in honour of
							the town of Quincy; first intended as a toast for the dinner; and
							somewhat aukwardly introduced me to the auditory— I then read my
							address, which occupied just one hour in the delivery— It was listened
							to with deep and undivided attention, and faintly applauded at the
							close, but did not suit the Society before which I spoke, nor their
							doctrines of total abstinence from the use of wine, which I neither
							approve nor practice— Extemporaneous addresses followed from <persRef
								ref="quincy-edmund4">Edmund Quincy</persRef>, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Colver, who made the concluding prayer, and by two other persons; all
							urging the principle of total abstinence, and pronouncing ludicrous
							invectives upon wine, fermentation, distillation, alcohol arsenic—also
							upon Rumsellers, traders in ardent spirits and spruce beer. Quincy was
							solemn and tragical— Pierpont, facetious and farcical; the others rude
							and radical— Notice was given of another meeting with addresses at 7.
							O’Clock this evening at the Orthodox Meeting house— Our Meeting was
							dismissed with a blessing by D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierce,
							after the adoption of several Resolutions— As I walked home I was
							overtaken, by Edmond Quincy, going home to Dedham, in his wagon
							chaise.</p>

						<p>This was the first day since I reached home from Washington that I have
							enjoyed any thing like relaxation from involuntary labour, and it was
							soon absorbed in the promise to write out my speech made at Weymouth on
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Much of the day was consumed in
							bringing up and assorting my file of Letters yet unanswered and the
							daily record, yesterday untouched— On recurring to my speech, I found a
							work of heavy labour before me to <unclear>finish?</unclear> it out; and I made very
							little progress in it.— I visited my garden and Nursery—and gathered a
							number of acorns from the trees of the English white Oaks which bear
							them in great profusion— I planted ten of them immediately in a row in
							the small patch South of the entrance into the garden from the kitchen
							gate. There are four of those trees in that patch from acorns planted
							there two years ago.— The great difficulty of raising these trees from
							the acorn, and also the shagbark hickory from the nut, is that when
							planted in the fall the seedling does not come up till July or August of
							the next year; then it has not time to grow in the course of the Season,
							so as to form a top bud that will survive the first winter— The stem is
							killed down to the ground by the frost, and the next Summer, throws out
							two or three slender shoots from the root, which again pass through the
							same process. Never attaining growth sufficient to abide the frost of
							the following winter—yet retaining sufficient vitality at the root to
							throw out annual shoots to languish through the Summer, and perish by
							the next Winter’s frost.— I have seen them drag along a puny life of six
							or seven years till a sharper winter than usual kills both root and
							stem— I suppose there is some remedy for these abortions, but I have not
							the wit to find it out— <persRef ref="andrew-charles">M<hi
