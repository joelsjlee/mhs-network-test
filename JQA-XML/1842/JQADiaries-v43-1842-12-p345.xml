                        <p>We breakfasted at <persRef ref="jones-john10">Jones’s</persRef> Union
                            Hotel— I had risen at half past 3. which being earlier than my regular
                            time I returned to bed till 5. and then wrote till past seven and had
                            not quite completed my task when breakfast was announced and the porter
                            came for our trunks. The steam-boat line to Wilmington is closed by the
                            ice in the Delaware— In the middle of the night the rain had given way
                            to sharp frost and the streets were one glare of frozen snow and ice—
                            Last evening I met at the tea-table <persRef ref="barney-john4">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> John Barney</persRef> just in by the
                            train from Baltimore, who said it had begun to snow there before
                            daylight that morning and that he had travelled through the snow the
                            whole day; with the roads at last so beclog’d that they were belated
                            upwards of two hours in reaching Philadelphia.— The Streets were so
                            slippery that we took a Cab to go to the ticket office in market street,
                            and when we got there we found two cars in the street frozen down by the
                            wheels to the street so that we were told it would require a forty
                            horsepower to start the one in which we were to travel— I thought we
                            should be obliged to go back to Jones’s and pass the day at
                            Philadelphia. Passengers for Baltimore however kept flocking to the
                            ticket Office, and among them were <persRef ref="morris-harriet">M<hi

                            New-Hampshire, and <persRef ref="toland-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Toland</persRef>, the member H.R.U.S. from Philadelphia;
                            and <persRef ref="sutherland-joel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Sutherland</persRef> was there bustling round, with every sort of
                            kind office to me, till at last he bought for two cents a morning paper
                            of one of the Mercury’s of the daily press, flitting round, and gave it
                            to me, saying there—put that in your pocket— It has got the trial for
                            murder. I had already provided myself with the United States Gazette of
                            the morning, but excepted with thanks the Doctor’s present— They packed
                            me up with all the Ladies in the outer car fronting the Office, to which
                            they tackled horses, and with much and repeated effort started loose
                            from the street; and took us round to another Car which had been housed
                            in the night, and was thus movable for travel, and with this we
                            proceeded on our way.— The two O’Clock morning train from Baltimore had
                            not come in— We were upwards of two hours belated in reaching
                            Wilmington— We had nearly reached the Susquehan. when we met the Cars of
                            the 2. O’Clock morning Baltimore train deserted by their passengers who
                            had been out all Night; and at the Susquehannah we met the 9 O’Clock
                            train of this Morning— We reached Baltimore at 5 in the afternoon. The
                            Cars for Washington; so we walked to <persRef ref="barnum-david"
                                >Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, and took lodgings for the Night. He gave
                            us a room with a wood fire; and after half an hour of conversation with

                        <p>I rose at half past four, made my fire, and wrote till breakfast time at
                            a quarter before 8. At 9 we walked to the depot of the Railway to
                            Washington and proceeded in them till soon after 11. we arrived at the
                            Office in the City at the foot of the Capitol Hill— We took a hack and
                            on reaching home, I was shocked at finding <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> sick in bed, to which
                            she has been confined almost the whole time since she arrived here from
                            Quincy— I had a strong presentiment all the morning that I should find
                            the house in affliction. The chief cause of my apprehension was that I
                            had been a full week in Boston, after receiving her Letter written on
                            the day of her arrival here without receiving another Letter from her—
                                <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
                                Adams</persRef> has also been very sick confined three days to her
                            bed since her return home— Nor has her daughter, <persRef
                                ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, wholly spared. She was
                            unwell at Philadelphia— They are both well now, and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams is convalescent.— It was a dismal
                            close to my journey, but I have hope that my wife is recovering and have
                            abundant reason to be thankful that we are safe here and our journey
                            performed without bad accident— When we left Philadelphia yesterday
                            morning, the train from Baltimore which had started at 2. A.M. had not
                            got in— We met the cars about 3 miles short of the Susquehanna, deserted
                            of their passengers, who were all the night out.— We met at the
                            Susquehannah, the Cars which had left Baltimore at 9. A.M. And <persRef
                                ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> who proceeded in the
                            Mail train from Philadelphia, at 4. P.M. the day before yesterday,
                            reached Baltimore only two hours before us yesterday; but in time to
                            come on to Washington last Evening— On the passage from Baltimore to
                            Washington this morning I had free conversation with <persRef
                                ref="buchanan-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Buchanan</persRef> and <persRef ref="eastman-ira">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastman</persRef>— The latter is ruled
                            out of re-election, by the democratic principle of rotation in office,
                            and intimated to me that he should henceforth take very little interest
                            in public affairs.— This appears also to be one of the natural
                            consequences of the rotatory principle— Buchanan’s re-election to the
                            Senate is also for consideration before the Legislature of Pennsylvania
                            this winter. He spoke of it as doubtfull of the event, and remarked that
                            there was no instance of a re-election by the Legislature of
                            Pennsylvania, of a Senator of the United States, for a second full term
                            of 6 years. Soon after I got home <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi

                                5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of Sept<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi> a check for 1500 dollars which I had neglected to enter in
                            my bank book, which had the appearance of a balance so much larger in my
                            favour— As I was returning home I was accosted by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Tibbits</persRef>, an inventor of some
                            Steam-engine safety-valve, which he says I introduced into the House of
                            Representatives for him in 1836. and that I then went and examined the
                            model of his invention which was not perfected. I had forgotten the
                            fact, but had some recollection of it, thus reminded— He says it is now
                            perfected and he wishes me to introduce a memorial, to the House of
                            Representatives about it again—which I consented to do— He told me a
                            long story, about an Act of Congress passed in 1838. making an
                            appropriation for experimenting upon his machine; but of which he has
                            never been able to obtain the execution— He told it in such a disjointed
                            manner that I could not half understand him; but he intreated me to go
                            and see his safety valve again; it being now at Georgetown; which I
                            promised to do, if I can find leisure— I wasted an hour in searching for
                            his alledged act of Congress without finding it— I went to the Capitol
                            and took the key of my draw, as the earnest of my seat—ordered some
                            Stationery; and the deficient sheets of the House Journal with the Index
                            and found sundry Letters and Newspapers at the Post-Office; where I met

                        <p>From the extreme cold of the last week the temperature of the atmosphere
                            has changed to a general thaw. I attended public worship this morning at
                            the second Presbyterian church where <persRef ref="moore-joseph">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph P. Moore</persRef> preached
                            from Matthew 4.17.— “Jesus began to preach”— I had heard M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore many times before but this discourse
                            both for style and thought was much superior to any thing that I had
                            noticed in his former Sermons— His manner was cold and heavy; and his
                            composition not above mediocrity— It was not so now. He was indeed
                            somewhat monotonous and stiff, but occasionally rose as if inspired by
                            his theme into considerable animation— There was an ornamented
                            phraseology which I had never before remarked in M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Moore’s Sermons, and in commenting upon the transcendent
                            importance to the history of mankind of that point of time, when “Jesus
                            began to preach” he presented a parallel between the humility of his
                            condition, a poor obscure peasant, the son of a <persRef ref="joseph5"
                                >Jewish Carpenter</persRef>, in a corner of the Roman province of
                            Galilee, and the glories of the Roman empire then at the summit of
                            power, and seated as if upon an eternal throne, contrasted with that
                            stupendous revolution in human affairs, that downfall of the Roman
                            Empire, and that revision, reversal, and purification of the Mosaic Law,
                            which was to be accomplished by this lowly preacher, which forcibly
                            struck my imagination— Then in descanting upon the nature and character
                            of the Saviour’s instructions, upon the universality of their
                            application to every condition of human life—to the rich and the poor,
                            to both sexes, to infancy and age, to all the relations of domestic
                            life; the exquisite adaption of his parables to the best feelings of the
                            human heart—the prodigal son, the good Samaritan, the repenting <persRef
                                ref="marymagdalen">Magdalen</persRef>, the sower and the seed the
                            steward and the household; there ran through all this a vein of
                            philosophy, such as I am little accustomed to expect from the
                            everlasting atonement of a presbyterian calvinist— I have seldom heard a
                            more edifying and pleasing discourse— There was another person named
                                <persRef ref="u">Sheldon</persRef> in the pulpit— A new comer—

                            advent; and preached from 1. Corinthians 10.12. “Wherefore let him that
                            thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”— What a world of wisdom in
                            those few words! Oh that I could profitably and unremittingly lay them
                            to heart! The Sermon was passable, but not so impressive as the text—
                            After church, I visited <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi

                            conversation with him half an hour. He is hypocondriac from
                            solitude—irrecoverable from debility, and in hourly expectation of a

                            commences— I was absorbed in reading the Letters and papers received by
                            the mail this morning till I was belated in reaching the Hall of the
                            House of Representatives— The house had been in Session ten minutes when
                            I took my seat, and they were occupied in calling the roll of members by
                            States when I entered. 174 members answered to their names. <persRef

                            I began early with my hot shot— The order for the appointment of
                            Chaplains was passed— The <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef>
                            came back from the Senate chamber with notice that they had not formed a
                            Quorum and at half past 12 the house adjourned till 12 to-morrow. Some
                            30 members, all but one or two of them whigs came and shook hand with me
                            at my seat, and the mutual greeting appeared all round friendly and good
                            humoured— After the adjournment I called at the Bank of Washington, and
                            received 48.75 a quarters interest—due 1. Oct<hi rend="superscript"

                            his desire to purchase the house; which I promised to take into

                        <p>At the meeting of the House this morning <persRef ref="johnson-william2"
                                >W. Cost Johnson</persRef> moved that 5000 copies of a document of
                            the last Session, called upon a resolution offered by me, containing a
                            statement of the debts of the several States, should be printed—but his
                            motion was laid on the table.— I called up my resolution for rescinding
                            the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule—The <persRef
                                ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> decided that although the house
                            had yesterday decided that they would not then put the main question, to
                            rescind, it was still under the operation of the previous question,
                            which must now be put again. I did not appeal from the decision but
                            observed that I had always understood that the refusal to put the main
                            question <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, exhausted the previous question,
                            and left the main question debatable. Other members were more refractory
                            than I was. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>
                            remonstrated. W. Cost Johnson moved to lay the Resolution on the
                            Table—lost by yeas and nays 90. to 91. Then the previous question was
                            again put and lost 91 to 93. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
                                >Underwood</persRef> still contested the decision of the Speaker who
                            said the subject must lie over till to morrow, and then the majority
                            will lay the resolution on the table. <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin"
                                >Bidlack</persRef> asked to be excused from voting on that question
                            and then defined his position.— He said he had always voted with the
                            South on this delicate question, and believed he should still; as long
                            as the South held together—but he saw that this day, some of the members
                            from Virginia and Kentucky voting the other way.— The Senate at last
                            formed a Quorum this day— The joint Committee were despatched with
                            notice to the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, and
                                <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> chairman of the house
                            committee reported that he would sent a Message forthwith; and it
                            accordingly came in soon after. Cushing moved the printing of 10000
                            copies extra which was carried— The message begins with a double dose of
                            pious gratitude for the continuous, health plenty, and prosperity all
                            over the country— Then crows at the conclusion of the Treaty with Great
                            Britain—and urges the necessity of further negotiation upon many other
                            points yet unsettled. Crows over an adjustment present and prospective
                            of the difficulties with Mexico— Pleads like a sturdy beggar, for the
                            adoption by Congress, for the Exchequer plan, which he prepared for them
                            and sent them last year, and concludes with a recommendation to Congress
                            to pay back to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>
                            with interest the fine imposed upon him by <persRef ref="hall-dominic"

                            laughter as a sop for Cerberus.— <persRef ref="botts-john"
                                >Botts</persRef> asked me seriously if I was ready to help him in

                            and <persRef ref="toland-george">Toland</persRef> shewed me a Resolution
                            he proposed to offer for an investigation of the causes of the removal

                            earnest desire for conversation with me on this subject; for my advice
                            to the Ambassador, and for Letters of recommendation from me to persons
                            of distinction and influence in Europe— I said I would very cheerfully
                            converse with him and give him any advice and assistance in my power;
                            but I had no acquaintance of distinction or influence in Europe; M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards said they had visited <persRef
                                ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Webster</persRef>, and made known to him the object of their
                            mission, which was to obtain an acknowledgment of their Independence,
                            and of their neutrality; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had
                            advised them, not to make any present movement here, but to commence
                            their diplomatic operations in England— I did not see the wisdom, of
                            leaving to Great-Britain the option, of assuming the Islands under her
                            protection, like the Ionian Islands—but I see the motive for Webster’s
                            advice, which is that they are black. I promised to see them again on
                            Saturday morning. At the house sundry other members took their seats,
                            and <persRef ref="burch-samuel">Burch</persRef> told me there were two
                            hundred and nine members of the house in the city— My Resolution to
                            rescind the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> rule came up again;

                                Underwood</persRef> contested the decision of the <persRef

                            remained in force after the house have refused to take the question now;
                            but the Speaker cited two precedents, one in 1828. and one at the last
                            Session, which he thought sustained him, which <persRef
                                ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and Underwood did not admit.
                            Underwood appealed from the decision but the appeal was laid on the
                            table— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> moved to lay
                            my Resolution on the table—lost 93 to 95. And the house for the 3<hi

                            not be put now—95 to 100.— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

                            but his motion was laid on the table 116 to 70— The house adjourned over
                            to Monday. <persRef ref="weems-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                        <p>This was a day of leisure, and I had intended to employ it in visiting
                            several of the public departments, but I left my papers here last
                            September in such a state of utter confusion that one of my
                            indispensable duties since my return has been to find and file them in
                            due order alphabetically month by month, from February when by the
                            pressure of my trial upon my time, the disorder began till September
                            when I left the city. This task will absorb all my leisure till the
                            close of the present year at least. My practice is to file all the
                            letters that I receive, and each month makes a file as large as can be
                            conveniently kept together—but so worthless is the great mass of my
                            passive correspondence, that if the letters having the slightest claim
                            to preservation were sifted from the chaff one yearly file would more
                            than suffice for the twelve Calendar Months. Besides these I have
                            miscellaneous files of Newspapers containing Articles of special
                            interest to which I wish occasionally to refer.— And all together the
                            form a mass of Archives, for which I have not chests and boxes and
                            bureaus and drawers sufficient in numbers and capacity to contain them.—
                            A separate building for a library of book cases and receptacles for the
                            safe keeping of manuscripts has become almost a necessary of life to me;
                            but I have not the means of erecting it— Will it be the good fortune of
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>? If it should ever be
                            in his power I enjoin it upon him as a duty— I was this morning so long
                            engaged in filing and endorsing Letters, that dinner time had come when
                            I had barely finished the record of yesterday. As morning visitors

                            to give a written answer to their proposals. The conversion and
                            civilization of these Islands by the agency of the missionaries forms an
                            era in the history of man— Their population is about 100 thousand and
                            they have 23 churches, and 20000 communicants— Idolatry is totally
                            extinguished— They have a written constitution formed by successive
                            representative Assemblies— A representative government in three
                            branches, legislative, executive and judicial—laws for the security of
                            property and the preservation of order and schools where reading,
                            writing and arithmetic are taught. They cultivate potatoes of both
                            kinds, rice, maize, and some wheat, and breed the various kinds of tame
                            animals in abundance— It is strange, and discouraging to think that
                            under all these improvements the population diminishes in numbers— M<hi

                        <p>he keenly felt the strictures that I have made upon the absurd
                            extravagance of his report to the President at the commencement of the
                            last Session of Congress.— With an estimate exceeding 8 millions of
                            dollars for the current year, gravely urging that we must raise a navy
                            at least equal to half that of Great-Britain and then stating that her
                            present naval force was more than eight times more numerous than ours.
                            This with a bankrupt Treasury, and an imbecil impotence of raising
                            revenue even for the current expenses of the year, stamped the character
                            of the administration for economy in characters indelible— It was
                            equally demonstrative of its insincerity or of its reckless stupidity. I
                            have commented upon it with ample freedom— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Upshur was peevish in his complaints of the insignificence
                            of the force which we could keep with the present paltry appropriations,
                            in the Mediterranean, on the coast of Africa, in the East-India seas,
                            and on the pacific Ocean— I said that when the Treasury should be
                            replenished we might be more liberal of appropriations— He said that was
                            the affair of Congress</p>

                        <p>A flight of Snow—soon dissolved. I attended public worship this morning
                            at the Presbyterian Church and heard <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Sheldon</persRef> the new preacher
                            engaged to supply the pulpit— His text was Isaiah 51.1–3. [“]1. Hearken
                            to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look
                            unto the rock, <hi rend="italic">whence</hi> ye are hewn and to the hole
                            of the pit, whence, ye are digged— 3. For the Lord shall comfort Zion:
                            he will comfort all her waste places, and he will make her wilderness
                            like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness
                            shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.” There is
                            no point in this text, to make it occasionally appropriate— The preacher
                            is quite a young man anxious and timid ambitious of originality, but
                            without much compass of thought or energy of expression. There was not
                            much attraction in his manner, nor much edification in his matter—
                            Perhaps he may improve. After church <persRef ref="rush-benjamin2">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Rush</persRef> paid me a
                            visit and after dinner a wild man named <persRef ref="lamson-silas"
                                >Silas Lamsan</persRef>, a native he says of Boylston in the County
                            of Worcester, Massachusetts— They call him a Dunker. He talks in the
                            singular number thou and thee, but does not profess to be a quaker— He
                            has the new testament at his tongues end, and rails against the
                            priesthood in professed imitation of Jesus Christ’s denunciation of the
                            pharisees— He told me he had suffered insult, and persecution and
                            imprisonment for following the example of Christ who overthrew the
                            tables of the money changers and turned them out of the temple, saying
                            that they had made the house of God a den of thieves. He said he had a
                            patent for an invention of his own; a scythe handle, well known and he
                            dared say I had heard of Lamson’s Scythe-handle; but I had not— He wears
                            a beard and a shabby suit of white cloth; with a long surtout and
                            Spencer over it; and a white jockey cap looking altogether like a miller
                            powdered over with flour— He detained me so long, by his persevering
                            effort at religious disputation that I was belated at S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, and found <persRef
                                ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
                            just about reading the creed—for the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                            Sunday in advent. He preached from Isaiah, without naming the chapter
                            and verse, but it was 11.10. “And in that day there shall be a root of
                                <persRef ref="jesse">Jesse</persRef>, which shall stand for an
                            ensign of the people; to it shall the gentiles seek: and his rest shall
                            be glorious.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley said this text was
                            appropriate to the season of the advent of the Saviour; being prophetic
                            of that great aera in the history of the human race; but he gave himself
                            no trouble to explain how the birth of the Saviour, is foreshadowed by
                            the prophet of the age of <persRef ref="hezekiah">Hezekiah</persRef>.
                            This prophesy of Isaiah is a mystery of the darkest order; and requires
                            theologians of <hi rend="italic">the first</hi> class for learning and
                            ingenuity to help it along. In the evening I finished revising the

                                Darby</persRef> came this morning, and we executed the lease for ten
                            years, of the house in Square 173. from the 6<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of last September, at a rent of 150 dollars a year,
                            payable quarterly; but he to expend the first years rent in repairs— He
                            says he has already expended two thirds of that amount. I promised to go
                            and see the house. <persRef ref="hodgkin-john">John Hodgkin</persRef>
                            came with a petition which he requested me to present to the house, for
                            payment of the balance of a bill of more than 7000 dollars for painting
                            the New-York Custom-house. I promised to present it— At the House— My
                            Resolution to rescind the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule was
                            laid on the table by yeas and nays 106 to 102. Absent 31. dead 2.

                            117 or possibly 122 to 120— The standing committees had been
                            announced—all the same as the last Session; except the cases of members
                            now absent. On the Committee of foreign Affairs, the only change from
                            the close of the last Session, is of <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"

                            out as chairman; requested also to be excused and was excused from
                            serving on the same grounds.— I am curious to see whether he will now
                            ask to be excused from serving with me again— <persRef

                            Committee of Ways and Means supposed to be hostile to the President—
                            Cushing’s proposed amendment failed by a small majority, and Fillmore’s
                            resolution were all adopted with an additional one proposing enquiries

                            lakes. There was some inflammable chaffering about this, and about the
                            recommendation by the President of a bill to refund the fine imposed

                        <p>In overhauling my chaotic files of letters and papers received during the
                            last Session for assortment and endorsement, I find some that I had
                            wasted hours in searching for in vain—others that I had not even read:
                            among which one from <persRef ref="allen-william6">William
                                Allen</persRef> of Northampton on the religious opinions of <persRef
                                key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, in refutation of a cankered
                            Article in an English review of my father’s Letters published by
                                <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— The reading of this
                            paper took up more than an hour— Its length was the reason of my filing
                            of it unread, when it was received— The Article of the English Review is
                            mere venom, which is not worthy of notice from me— At the house <persRef
                                ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> obtained leave for the
                            Committee of Ways and Means to employ a Clerk. <persRef ref="botts-john"
                                >John M. Botts</persRef>, raised a question of privilege upon a
                            Letter from <persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef>,
                            Secretary of War, published in the Albany Argus of 25. October,
                            immediately before the recent elections in the State of New York in
                            defence of <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef>, and
                            containing bases charges against the leaders of the whig party, at the
                            time of the vetos on the two Bank bills— The amount of the charge is
                            that between the first and second Bank veto the leaders of the whig
                            party, proposed to the President to postpone the Bank question to the
                            next Session if he would promise in the mean time not to dismiss any of
                            the members of his then cabinet—and that Tyler rejected the proposal
                            with scorn.— Botts considered this as a charge of corruption against the
                            leaders of the whig party, and so it was intended by Spencer; but
                                <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and <persRef

                                ref="irwin-william">Irwin</persRef> succeeded in slipping through it
                            by parrying it as a Privileged question, which could be carried by a
                            majority; and then voting for as suspension of the rules to let it in by
                            a vote of two thirds which they knew could not be carried— After a long
                            skirmishing between Botts and Wise and doubling of corners by the
                                <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> the house by yeas and
                            nays 85 to 106. refused to receive the resolution as a question of
                            privilege— After which <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>
                            obtaine a suspension of the rules to introduce his bill to repeal the
                            Bankrupt act— Many were clamorous to pass it at once, but it was finally
                            made the special order of the day for next Tuesday— <persRef
                                ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> then moved a suspension
                            of the rules to introduce Botts’s investigating enquiry, vote for which
                            was 78 to 109—a majority, but not two thirds.— Some testimony was
                            received, and a squall arose upon a motion of <persRef
                                ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> to refer it to the
                            Committee of Elections, in the midst of which the house adjourned.— I
                            notified the members of the Committee of foreign Affairs to meet
                            to-morrow at 11. This evening I was visited by <persRef ref="paine-john"

                        <p>Visit to the Departments. First at the Pension Office; to which I took
                            all the papers concerning the pension claim of <persRef
                                ref="beedle-winche">Winche Beedle</persRef> which I had mislaid last
                            Summer, and which in the general search of my papers here, I had now
                            found— This Evening I received a Letter from the <persRef
                                ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of Pensions James L.

                            went next to the bounty land-Office to enquire concerning a warrant
                            issued by <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> in
                            1805, but was referred by <persRef ref="gordon-william5">M<hi

                            Register of Cadets of June 1842 of which <persRef ref="parker-daniel"
                                    >Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Parker</persRef> had given me
                            a copy there were only 5 marked as from Massachusetts. By the
                            regulations she was entitled to 12.— I wished to ascertain how many had
                            been admitted last June, and if there was any deficiency in the number
                            from Massachusetts to press urgently for the admission of <persRef
                                ref="hedge-isaac2">young Hedge</persRef>, next June. I found however
                            that there were 7 admitted last June, giving to Massachusetts her full
                            number even while she had 12 Congressional Districts; one of the 7.
                                <persRef ref="u">Darby</persRef>, having been admitted at my special
                            and earnest solicitation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer was
                            exceedingly courteous in his demeanour, and enquired if I should be
                            willing to receive an appointment as a visitor of the academy next
                            Summer— I thanked him for the offer, and said I did not know how far I
                            should have my time at my own disposal next Spring, and as I knew that
                            office of visitor at the Academy was very anxiously coveted by many
                            persons, I would not wish to stand in the way of any one who might
                            otherwise obtain it. He read to me a Letter from an Officer at the
                            Academy, stating that a Grandson of <persRef ref="greene-nathanael"
                                >General Green</persRef> residing in Rhode-Island, had claimed the
                            property of two trophy pieces of cannon now at West Point, but which he
                            insists were presented to General Green by a Resolution of Congress—
                            They were taken at the surrender of <persRef ref="burgoyne-john"
                                >Burgoyne</persRef>, and they are excessively unwilling to let them
                            go from West-Point.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer asked my
                            advice what to do about it— I said if there was such a Resolution of
                            Congress it must speak for itself; and the property must be in the
                            General’s Executor or Administrator—and I should advise to purchas them
                            of him, and pay very liberally for them. At the house several documents
                            from the Executive departments were received, and the residue of the day
                            was occupied in a hack debate in Committee of the whole on the State of
                            the Union, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the Chair,

                        <p>The assortment and filing and endorsement of my papers in monthly files
                            of my Letters received from last March till September yet absorbs all my
                            leisure time; and the unassorted papers are yet in so many heaps that I
                            do but just begin to see my way clear but of the tangle— In the mean
                            time, every day brings new trashy materials for large files of the
                            present Session— I am however, the first time for six years relieved
                            from the burden of unreceivable petitions.— The <persRef
                                ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> has decided that the mode of
                            receiving petitions adopted upon a resolution offered by me at the last
                            Session is yet in force; by this and the practice of the Speaker under
                            it, every member not only introduces any and every petition that he
                            pleases but has it referred to any Committee that he thinks appropriate—
                            I had ten petitions which I should have presented if the States had been
                            called; but after the speaker’s present decision, I made out the list;
                            directed the committee to which each of them should be referred, and
                            gave the list, after it was entered on the Journal of the house, to
                                <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Gales</persRef>, to be published in the National Intelligencer, and
                            it was published in the paper of this day.— The Speaker’s decision was,
                            I believe unwarranted, and the chance is that it will terminate in an
                            explosion.— At the house several resolutions were adopted without
                            opposition, but <persRef ref="toland-george">G. W. Toland</persRef>
                            offered one of enquiry into the causes of the removal of <persRef

                            went into Committee of the whole on the state of the union upon the half

                                >Cushing</persRef> had come to the conclusion that Hassler was both
                            physically and mentally incompetent to his office of superintendent of

                        <p>Attended public worship in the Hall of the House of Representatives—

                                Tiffany</persRef> read the abridged morning service for the 4<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday in Advent, and preached from
                            Proverbs 9.12 “If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if
                            thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.”— Some 35 years ago I heard the
                                <persRef ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Peter
                                Whitney</persRef> at Quincy preach a sermon upon this text, and
                            about ten years since I heard him read it again— From the first delivery
                            of the text it has been impressed on my memory, though I have not one
                            trace of recollection of the twice repeated sermon— What is <hi
                                rend="italic">thought</hi>? I believe I shall remember, as long as I
                            shall be permitted to retain the memory of any thing that M<hi

                            representative Hall, was upon this text, but of the Sermon itself I
                            retain no more than I do of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s
                            discourse, twice heard and forgotten forever— What a lesson of Wisdom
                            bedded in the motive of selfishness— <persRef ref="solomon"
                                >Solomon</persRef> speaks to his son—and bids him be wise for his
                            own sake— And what is the meaning here of the word wise? the fear of the
                            Lord is the beginning of wisdom—but if thou scornest—scornest what?— The
                            words scorn and scorn and scorner are used in the bible in a sense
                            peculiar to itself— It is not merely unbelief but contemptuous
                            disbelief—and it is a remarkable ingredient of all religious infidelity—
                            It is never a quiet, but a perturbed state of mind—an angry passion—
                            Thou alone shalt bear it—bear what? bear thy own scorn— It is a
                            vexatious and harrassing state of mind, and a religious infidel is a
                            self-tormentor— This appears to me to be the import of the text and its
                            lesson is a precept of prudence— Why is it that Faith is enjoyment, and
                            that scorn is wretchedness? My conclusion is than in the philosophy of
                            Solomon, religious Faith is one of the natural wants of man, a source of
                            enjoyment to himself, and that the wilful rejection of it is a calamity—
                            The Hall was well filled, with an unusual number of members, and M<hi

                                >Roger L Gamble</persRef>, a member from Georgia, announced with a
                            suitable Eulogy, the death of his colleague <persRef

                            newspaper, as long as a week ago, but the fact was doubted, and not
                            authenticated till last evening. Gamble’s panegyric was of the routine
                            cast, delivered with some embarrassment and no genuine feeling—
                            Habersham, was an amiable gentleman, of very moderate abilities a full

                            usual obituary resolutions were adopted, and the house adjourned— I

                            manifestation of sensibility. Perhaps this was owing to the thrilling

                            account of this horrible tragedy, appeared in the National Intelligencer
                            of this morning— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
                                Winthrop</persRef>, consulted me, about what he should do with a
                            memorial which he has received, signed by a large number of the most
                            respectable and distinguished Citizens of Boston, remonstrating against
                            the unconstitutional and oppressive Laws of some of the Southern States,
                            against free coloured citizens of Massachusetts— He proposed, according
                            to the rule of the last Session which the <persRef ref="white-john6"
                                >Speaker</persRef> has declared to be in force, to enter the
                            memorial at the clerk’s table, and have it referred to the judiciary
                            Committee for a report. And thereupon to raise a debate if possible. I
                            approved this course— He said he had a copy of this Memorial addressed
                            to the Senate with instructions to ask <persRef ref="evans-george2"
                                >George Evans</persRef> of Maine to present it—and not either of the

                            yesterday promised he would ask him to do; and I gave him the Letter and
                            circular, which that strange man <persRef ref="gregory-sherlock"
                                >Sherlock S. Gregory</persRef> of Sandlake New-York, had enclosed to
                            me for him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards knew him 25 years
                            ago as a youth of 16. at Sandlake— He is a man of pure and benevolent
                            heart of deep and stubborn moral principle, of weak judgment, and yet
                            strong reasoning faculties, a composition not rare in the varieties of
                            human character, and which usually results in a mischievous, restless
                            turbulent marplot of his own comfort and that of his neighbours— How is
                            it that the purity of abstract self-evident truth cannot be carried out
                            in the realities of life— Mathematical truth requires an allowance of
                            one third, for adaptation to physical nature—and the same Law is
                            applicable to moral truth—and even to religious truth. I had also much
                            conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards, concerning
                            his joint embassy with Ha li lio—more perplexing to <persRef

                            have yet disclosed to either of the Ambassadors themselves.— I went to
                            the General Post-Office, with a Letter from <persRef ref="munroe-n">N.
                                Munroe</persRef> at West-Bradford pressing for an answer to an old
                            application for a change of the name of the Post-Office there— <persRef

                                Wickliffe</persRef> sent for the memorial, and after reading it,
                            which he had evidently never done before, said it required a change of
                            name of two Post-Offices, and should be attended to.— As to the
                            Post-Office at South Dedham—the usual enquiries had been instituted—

                            the previous question twice called; a considerable majority refused to
                            sustain it the first time, and the house adjourned without taking the

                            enquired of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>, how it
                            stood this morning— The Speaker said that the first hour must be given
                            to the call upon Committees for Reports. But the Committee of Claims
                            only was called— <persRef ref="cowen-benjamin">Cowen</persRef> moved a
                            Resolution, that on Friday and Saturday next the house will meet at 10.
                            A.M. to dispose of business relating to private claims— This was a
                            startling proposition, voted down at once but carried by the call for a

                            moved that the Committee be authorised to continue the employment of a

                            The resolution finally passed with the addition of during the present
                            Session, precluding the employment of the Clerk from the close of this

                            who bustles upon every thing prevailed upon Pickens to withdraw his

                            for the previous question— Pickens accordingly withdrew his motion—
                            Cushing then moved his amendment, to which <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"

                            question— But the house by tellers 66 to 94 refused a second to the
                            previous question, and the whole debate was again opened— Then <persRef

                            seized this morning immediately after breakfast with a chill, which
                            compelled her to take again to her bed; and it proved to be a severe
                            attack of Erisypelas— She was severely ill the whole day and evening

                            Government of Denmark, of indemnity for spoliations— There was an old

                            quasi war with France in 1799, prosecuted year after year from that
                            time, counterbalanced by a still older claim of the United States
                            against Denmark for certain British prizes taken by the squadron of
                                <persRef ref="jones-john-paul">Paul Jones</persRef>, and <persRef

                            and there delivered up to their original English owners— Connell says
                            that when the adjustment was made by the Government of Denmark some ten
                            or twelve years since, of our claims for depredations from 1809 to 1811,
                            the king of Denmark said that as part of the indemnities granted by him
                            he transferred to the claimants all his claim on account of the Brig

                        <p>A spell of cold weather came on so that I could not write early this
                            morning, and that occasioned an arrearage— I slept in the upper chamber,
                            and after making my fire was obliged to resort to reading by lamplight
                            to employ the time till breakfast— I read a pamphlet, entitled Martial
                            law, by a Kentuckian in four numbers of republication from a Kentucky
                            Newspaper.— Its author is said to be a man named <persRef
                                ref="nicholas-samuel">Nicholas</persRef> of the old Virginian family
                            of that name, and is or has been a judge in the State of Kentucky.— In
                            the form of a Dissertation upon martial Law, it is a violent invective
                            against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> for
                            declaring Martial Law at New-Orleans, which he contends was Treason
                            against the United States.— Then against me for having assorted in the
                            house of representatives that by the same martial law which Jackson
                            declared at New-Orleans, he might have emancipated all the Slaves in
                            Louisiana. The Senators <persRef ref="buchanan-james2"
                                >Buchanan</persRef> and <persRef ref="berrien-john"
                                >Berrien</persRef> came in for a share of his abuse— The Legislature
                            of Rhode-Island—and the minority of the judiciary Committee of the
                            House, in their report on the bill for refunding Jackson’s fine have
                            also their share, but the motive at the bottom of it all is the panic
                            terror at my exposure of the danger to Southern Slavery of eventual
                            emancipation by martial law— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi

                            evening before last from Boston, called on me this morning, whereby I
                            was delayed in reaching the house, about ten minutes. They were taking
                            the yeas and nays on a motion to adjourn consequent upon a lack of a
                            quorum precisely at 10.— The vote against adjournment was 109. to 7. but
                            while the yeas and nays were in taking the quorum was formed. The house
                            immediately took up the private Calendar, beginning with bills at the
                            third reading of which 117. were passed without objection; every one to
                            which objection was made being passed over.— The house then went into

                            in the chair, when 30 more bills were reported to the house, without
                            amendment, read a third time and passed. I went into the Senate, and
                            gave <persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Bates</persRef> a list of 7 the bills which had passed the house,
                            requesting the attention of the Massachusetts Senators to them while
                            before the Senate, which he promised to do— I had some conversation with
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buchanan about the Kentucky pamphlet
                            which seemed to have startled him— In the house <persRef

                            of <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>— I prevailed upon

                            reduces them to less than 2000 dollars a year— He has been hitherto
                            unsuccessful, but a bill to effect the purpose has now been hurried
                            through the Senate without opposition, and seemingly without
                            examination, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Denison fears it will be
                            driven through the house in the same manner, without reference to any
                            Committee. I promised him if I should be in the house when it comes up
                            to move its reference to the Committee of Post-Offices and Post-roads.—
                                <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant Wilkes</persRef> came in
                            great solicitude about his promotion— The act of the last Session of
                            Congress limiting the number of Officers of the respective ranks,
                            precludes the nomination till vacancies shall occur; but he said
                                <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Barnard</persRef> thought an act of Congress might authorise the
                            President to make a given number of extra nominations, supernumerary.— I
                            promised to confer with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard upon this
                            expedient; but I thought as the Constitution gave to the President the
                            power of nomination it might be doubted whether Congress could either
                            enlarge or curtail it— <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

                        <p>Christmas—</p>
                        <p>The usual salutation of a merry Christmas met my ears this morning, only
                            to aggravate the sharpness of the affliction with which I rose from the
                            disturbed repose of the Night— The illness of <persRef
                                key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, is distressing
                            beyond my power of expression under the violence of an attack of the
                            Erisypelas just as she was seeming to be convalescent from a confinement
                            of a full month to her chamber, tortured with a never ceasing nervous
                            cough which it is scarcely credible that the human frame could survive.—
                            It came on with sharp winters cold and <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
                                >Fahrenheit’s</persRef> thermometer yesterday morning at 16— It had
                            risen this morning to 24. and continued moderating all this day with a
                            clearing sky and a bright Sun, yet without any abatement of the severity
                            of the symptoms of my wife’s disease— The internal inflammation of the
                            fire has been brought out in a preternatural swelling of the face and
                            head, to an almost total obstruction of the paths of sound and closing
                            of her eyes— I have passed through other Christmas days of deep
                            affliction; but none of more suffering than this.— I attended public
                            worship this morning at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where
                                <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Tustin</persRef> the chaplain of the Senate preached from Luke
                            19.41. [“]And when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over
                            it. 42. Saying, if thou hadst known even thou, at least, in this thy
                            day, the things, which belong unto thy peace! but now, they are hid from
                            thine eyes.”— This immediately precedes the awful prophesy of the
                            destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans— The English translation of the
                            text is incorrect, and the text obviously ungrammatical. It should be
                            read—Hadst thou but known &amp;c.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin
                            expatiated upon the dreadful destruction of Jerusalem as related by
                                <persRef ref="josephus">Josephus</persRef>; and appeared to attach
                            an exuberant importance to the incident that Jesus wept— The pathos of
                            the discourse was of the melancholy cast, and not specially adapted to
                            the joyous temper of the day.— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin
                            is a presbyterian, and made not the slightest allusion to the nativity
                            of the Saviour— After the service I called to see <persRef
                                ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch</persRef>, who has been confined
                            several days to his chamber with a threatened pleurisy; but is
                            convalescent.— I met there the <persRef ref="appleton-elizabeth">eldest

                            Here on a visit, and last from Baltimore, where she is keeping school.—

                            read the evening service for Christmas day, and instead of a Sermon,
                            gave a brief exposition of the second lesson, being Titus 3–4. [“]But
                            after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared;
                            not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
                            mercy, he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
                            holy Ghost,” and so to v. 7. inclusive.</p>

                        <p>I should have devoted this day to returning visits, but it is to me a
                            waste of time so irksome, that I suffered the hours to slip away till it
                            was too late, and my only excursion from home was a half hour’s walk
                            before dinner— Hours were consumed in reading Newspapers— In the
                            National Intelligencer of this morning, are Letters from <persRef

                            am to deliver to Lewis Johnson, upon his furnishing satisfactory

                            speech; but it was choked off by objections from various quarters.
                            Everett’s bankrupt law repeal came up, and <persRef

                            remarkable from the quarter whence it issued— But next came from Cushing
                            one of the most extraordinary speeches ever delivered in that Hall— In
                            obscure, ambiguous language, conveying ideas, veiled and shaded as if
                            purposely intended to be disavowed if they should happen to be too well
                            understood; but holding up the presidential power and especially the
                            veto at auction between the two great parties which divide the Country—

                            and cruelty to me of this tenacity at the Treasury, which can be
                            rectified only by Congress, and I promised him whatever aid I could give

                            the public busiess, I noted one of them—a Resolution offered by <persRef

                            a select committee, to devise expedients for the construction of armed

                            and abroad, and for the revenue service; and convertible into
                            War-steamers in the event of War— I observed that a joint report was
                            called for from the State and Navy Departments, on a proposition of the
                            French Government on this subject, but King urged that he wanted only a
                            Committee of enquiry; and I did not press an objection. This new passion
                            of the South for the Navy grows more and more intense—all for the
                            protection of Slavery and the internal Slave trade According to my
                            notice given last Friday, I moved to go into Committee of the whole on
                            the state of the Union, upon the French spoliation bill, but the house
                            by yeas and nays 88 to 99 refused. <persRef ref="everett-horace"

                            Everett then made a cutting speech, and closed by moving the previous

                            intreated him to withdraw the motion, but he would not— But a large

                            from well.— At the house, among the preliminary intrusions were 1. a
                            Memorial from Pennsylvania, presented by <persRef ref="cooper-james2"
                                >James Cooper</persRef>, praying for the creation of 200 millions of

                                Johnson</persRef> moved to lay the whole subject on the table— This

                            even to Cave Johnson the yeas and nays.— <persRef ref="pickens-francis"

                            lay it on the table; but Everetts motion prevailed. When the bill to

                                >Wise</persRef> with a flourish of trumpets made his hour speech,

                            suspension of the hour rule to obtain it— And what with weazel malignity
                            and dastardly whiggery there was a vote by yeas and nays of 100 to 80.
                            to grant him the privilege— As he could not obtain two thirds, he failed
                            in his insolent pretension. <persRef ref="fessenden-william"
                                >Fessenden</persRef> of Maine closed the debate for the day, with an

                            to read it, and then say if I would be willing to serve on his select

                            of their Government as a Sovereign, independent State, and proposing to
                            negotiate a commercial Treaty.— The answer, in language not very
                            explicit, evades a direct acknowledgment, and declines the negotiation
                            of a Treaty—but argues the right of the Sandwich Islands to be
                            recognized as an independent State, and against the right of any
                            European power to colonize, or take possession of them— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards said that M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Webster had been more explicit with them in verbal
                            conference and had told them that the whole subject of their
                            transactions with him would be immediately communicated to Congress—
                            Accordingly a Message from the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
                                >President</persRef> was received and presented by the <persRef
                                ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> to the House recommending an
                            appropriation for maintaining a Consul at the Sandwich Islands; and
                            another for a formal mission to China; which at the motion of <persRef

                            was ordered to be printed, and referred to the Committee of foreign
                            Affairs.— The message, evidently Webster’s composition, contains an
                            elaborate, and able argument for the recognition of the Sandwich Island
                            Government, and for the mission to China— The remainder of the day till
                            3 was occupied with sundry motions to reconsider sundry private bills
                            which had been passed— They were debated over again; but in every case
                            the motion to reconsider was lost— At 3. the house adjourned over till
                            Tuesday.— I went to the chamber of the committee of Foreign Affairs;
                            locked myself in; and wrote the diary of yesterday, till 5— A
                            convocation of chairs in the chamber indicated that a whig Caucus was to
                            be held there, which upon enquiry I found, was to be at half past 6.
                            this evening—but whether to doom the bankrupt act, or the Treaty, I
                            suppose, next week will disclose.— I had been invited to dine at 5. with

                            returning home at the adjournment of the house, had ordered <persRef

                            Carriage at 8 O’Clock, which he did— The company at the dinner, are
