						<p><persRef ref="maher-james">Maher</persRef> is the gardener of the Capitol
							and the public grounds, extending to those round the President’s house
							where <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ousely</persRef> is only the kitchen
							gardener— Maher came to me this morning complaining that <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stanley</persRef>
							had been deceived by misrepresentations, and thus induced to charge him
							with abusive expenditures on the public grounds— Stanly had attacked
							him, he said, two years ago, but <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> then chairman of the Committee on the public
							buildings had defended him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stanley now
							renewed the attack; and he had lost his friend Governor Lincoln— He
							explained to me some of the facts alluded to one day last week by
							Stanley, who yields too much to his indignation at the plunder of the
							public, the incurable vice of all the departments of governments, and
							for some petty, perhaps inconsiderate over charges, said there was no
							part of the public expenses more corruptly managed than those of the
							public gardener.— I believe this is unjust—but I despair of convincing
							Stanley— <persRef ref="babbit-amzi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Babbitt</persRef> came too this morning—urging me to call up the
							French spoliation bill: and he brought me a second list of members,
							marked, shewing a majority of the house in favour of taking up and of
							passing the bill— At the house <persRef ref="bowne-samuel"
								>Bowne</persRef> of New-York made a ridiculous attempt to turn
								<persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold’s</persRef> over-hasty
							adjournment of the house into a grave misdemeanor to be entered formally
							upon the journal— It was a mere inadvertence of no importance whatever
							in as much as the house was in a state of dissolution, not 50 members
							within the bar— Bowne raised a squall, but it soon passed away; and his
							motion to amend the journal was laid on the table by yeas and nays 97 to
							87. Some question arose as to what business was to be taken up— The
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said it was petition
							day and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> presented one
							petition— <persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">Pendleton</persRef>
							proposed to present a report from the military committee, to which
								<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> objected. The
							contingent appropriation bill was taken up— <persRef
								ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> resumed his speech and
							concluded it, to which <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R
								Ingersoll</persRef> replied—debate followed and the engrossment of
							the bill was carried by yeas and nays 91 to 78. and afterwards with the
							help of the previous question was passed— Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union. I moved to take up the French spoliation bill, ayes
							51. Stanly moved to take up the Senate’s bill for reorganizing the army,
							which was carried.— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
							moved a substitute, beginning by a repeal of the act of 1838 increasing
							the army—after long debate the Committee rose— I offered a call on the
							Secretaries of <persRef ref="spencer-john">War</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="upshur-abel">Navy</persRef> for returns of the number
							of coloured persons enlisted or employed in the Army or Navy. Carried
							against some resistance from the South— Adjourned at 5— Walk after
							dinner.— Evening cold— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi

							Proffit, Cushing and <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef>
							voted for it but the whole democracy voted against it—the yeas and nays

						<p>It was midnight last evening before we got home from the theatre, and it
							was half an hour later than usual when I rose. <persRef ref="black-mary"
								>Mary Black</persRef> is a negro woman who brought me the
							Constitution of a female coloured charitable mite Society; for a small
							contribution— A regularly constituted corporation, with President, Vice
							President, Secretary, Treasurer and directresses—an amusing example of
							the associating Spirit— High life below Stairs— <persRef
								ref="beard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard</persRef> is
							a painter by profession, and brought me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="cranch-john">John Cranch</persRef> of Cincinnati— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard wished to paint my portrait, and I
							promised to sit to morrow morning, from 9 to 10 O’Clock, at a small
							building at the head of the Pennsylvania avenue recently built as a
							painting studio— At the house after half an hour of miscellaneous
							business of routine, they went into Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union, <persRef ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> in
							the chair and took up the bill for reorganizing the army— <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> had moved as amendment a
							substitute for the whole bill— <persRef ref="mason-samson">Samson
								Mason</persRef> had moved as an amendment to Cave Johnson’s
							amendment that the second Regiment of Dragoons, shall on the first day
							of October next be disbanded.— This was the ordeal question of reduction
							of the army, when first presented to the house it had been lost by a
							majority of two—then upon reconsideration carried by a majority of one—
							It was now carried in Committee by tellers 68 to 55—whereupon <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> moved that the Committee rise
							and report the bill with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
							postponed— Stanly said he must be joking. Proffit replied that he never
							was more serious in his life—for the army was to be sacrificed and
							destroyed, and he had foreseen its fate from the day that I had declared
							my purpose to reduce it— Proffit abandoned his motion; little imagining
							what a dose of wormwood he was administering to <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Captain Tyler</persRef> and his democratic allies
							by imputing the reduction of the army to me— Cave Johnson’s substitute
							for the whole bill was then taken up— I moved the reduction of the rank
							and file in all the regiments from 50 to 42 and instead of disbanding
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> regiment of infantry and
							authorizing the President to form a regiment of mounted riflemen, to
							continue the regiment of infantry, and have no mounted riflemen. At 3.
							O’Clock, the voting began, upon the amendments—the bill was made to
							conform entirely conformable to my views so far as related to the
							reduction of the army, and was reported to the house. Cave Johnson moved
							to lay it on the table—rejected 55 to 115— <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef> moved the previous question, which was ordered,
							and the house then adjourned.— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"

							at the head of Pennsylvania avenue, from 9 to 10— He had with him a
							portrait of <persRef ref="harrison-william">President

							But he appears to have a theoretical knowledge of the principles of his
							art— I promised him another sitting on Saturday morning— At the house,
								<persRef ref="appleton-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Appleton</persRef> gave me to read a Letter to him, from the
							ci-devant <persRef ref="jackson-charles">judge Charles
							Jackson</persRef>, in awful trepidation at the prospect of the whigs
							persevering, in the refusal to pass a tariff bill without the section
							securing to the States the proceeds of the sales of the public Lands—
							The judge’s property is chiefly in the Lowell factories, and he cares
							not a peppercorn for the interest of the whole people in the public
							Lands.— I returned the Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Appleton, and told him that I dissented from every line of judge
							Jackson’s Letter. Appleton somewhat excited said that the judge’s
							opinion was the unanimous opinion of all our friends at home— I said I
							was sorry for it, but could not help it— But I see the whigs will
							finally flinch, for the sake of a tariff, and will surrender forever the
							public lands— I had yesterday a conversation with <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker White</persRef> in his chamber, on this
							subject in consequence of a Letter which he had delivered to me from
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef>, who earnestly urges me
							to take the lead in the approaching crisis— And <persRef
								ref="thompson-richard">Richard W. Thompson</persRef> came to me this
							day, and urged me to attend a meeting of a committee of 21 members one
							from each whig State, to consider what is to be done, when the veto of
							the tariff will come. My opinion is that Congress ought immediately to
							adjourn; but as I know they will not I see no necessity for making
							myself at once a useless and a voluntary victim— I declined attending
							the meeting.— The Resolutions upon the answer of the <persRef
								ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef> declining to send
							papers called for by the house, was debated by <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>
							<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef>, till the expiration of

							reorganizing the army came on— The vote for disbanding the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> regiment of dragoons by yeas nays was 100
							to 69.—to lay the bill on the table<space/>on the passage of the bill 123 to
							52— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union Bill for regulating
							the testimony in contested elections, debated till the adjournment—
							Sundry visitors this evening occupied me till past 10 O’Clock— <persRef

							was brought into discussion, and particularly the debts of the States
							and Territories, and the liabilities in which they may involve the
							Nation— We continued the debate until the house had been half an hour in

							speaking on the Resolution reported by him from the Committee of Indian
							Affairs of the right of the house to call for papers, and the answer of
							the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, declining to
							send the papers called for— He finished his hour, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett followed, offering an amendment as
							a substitute for the three resolutions: merely that the reasons of the
							Secretary of War for declining to send the papers are not satisfactory—
							He made a very short speech in support of his motion.— When he closed
							the question was about to be taken— Just before, I had been called out
							of my seat, by <persRef ref="u">judge Swymmer</persRef> from S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s New Brunswick, who reminded me
							that he had visited me, when I was in that city, in September 1840.— I
							introduced him on the floor of the house, and was talking with him when
							Cooper came, and urged me to say a few words upon the question, which
							was about to be taken— I returned to my seat, and spoke 27 minutes till
							the expiration of the morning hour. Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="boardman-william">Boardman</persRef> of Connecticut in the

							bills were reported to the house without objection or with objections
							withdrawn; about 70 were laid aside as debateable, and upwards of 20
							were reported with recommendation that they should be rejected— The

						<p>Gave a sitting from 9 to 10 to <persRef ref="beard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard</persRef>— His progress hitherto
							is not encouraging— It is the most hideous caricature that I ever
							beheld— At the house after a full half hour of obtrusions as usual of
							business out of order and out of time, the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> announced <persRef ref="cooper-james2">James
								Cooper’s</persRef> resolutions from the Committee of Indian affairs,
							with <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett’s</persRef> proposed
							amendment as the business of the morning; and that I had the floor— I
							enquired what time I had left to complete my hour—he said 33 minutes— I
							am confident it was at least ten minutes more, but I lost my time by not
							marking it myself— I said I was very desirous of abridging the time in
							which I should be compelled to trespass on the indulgence of the house;
							and there was a contingency which might happen before Monday Morning,
							and which would render a very large portion, of what otherwise I must
							say, altogether unnecessary. I meant the signing by the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> of the Tariff bill— I said I
							would therefore move the postponement till Monday Morning of Cooper’s
							Resolutions, and to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union to take up the French spoliation claim bill.— The Speaker said it
							was not in order to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, to take up any particular bill. I then moved to go into Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union, generally: but not more than 50
							members rose in the affirmative.— So I was obliged to proceed, in a
							defence of Congress against a violent charge by <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> that they must fulfil their
							destiny, which is to prostrate the Government of the United States, to
							be resuscitated and restored by our successors. I had not proceeded 3
							minutes before <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> raised a
							point of order; that no answer can be made in the house to what has been
							said in committee of the whole— The Speaker said that was the rule; but
							that Cushing had been very liberally indulged in the remarks upon which

						<p>On returning last evening from hearing the music of the Marine corps
							band, passing by <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cutts’s</persRef> house, he was sitting with <persRef
								ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Madison</persRef> at the window, and his daughter <persRef
								ref="cutts-mary">Mary</persRef> standing with <persRef
								ref="payne-anna">Anna Payne</persRef> at the door invited me in— I
							went in accordingly, and had half an hour of chat with them, till M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison left, to return home.— After the
							adjournment of the house yesterday, I went to the chamber of the
							Committee of foreign Affairs, to write till 5. when I had ordered
								<persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> to come for me with
							the Barouche— I found <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> there writing who told me he was waiting to
							meet a Committee there at 6. O’Clock— This morning I attended alone at
							the Hall of the house of Representatives where <persRef
								ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> preached from Matthew 12.31. “Wherefore I say unto
							you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven, unto men: but
							the blasphemy against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven 32. And
							whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven
							him; but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not be
							forgiven him; neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” A
							discourse upon the unpardonable sin— A subject much beyond the powers of
							the preacher.— He treated it very feebly— There is not perhaps in all
							the Scriptures a subject of more difficulty and delicacy. There is a
							learned and ingenious Sermon of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef> in which it is discussed with all his ability.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin’s auditory did not exceed 100
							persons— The chief and perhaps insuperable difficulty of discoursing on
							the unpardonable sin is to ascertain what it is— The prevalent opinion
							that it is the crime of imputing to an evil spirit the operations of the
							Spirit of God is very unsatisfactory to me. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tustin adopted it without controversy— There is some
							plausibility in this opinion, countenanced by collation with other
							passages, but it is all inferential. Notwithstanding this dreadful
							denuntiation against the sin, it is not explicitly said what the sin is,
							and I incline much to doubt whether the text itself is not an
							interpolation of the unhappy and fatal effect it has produced upon the
							weakness of multitudes in the fear that they had unconsciously committed
							this sin without knowing what it was. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tustin said nothing— He exhorted affectionately his hearers to great
							caution by fulfilling all their duties, to avoid the possibility of
							committing it, and assured them, that with such caution they would never
							be in danger of committing it— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church a stranger read the service for the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Sunday after Trinity and preached from 1.
							Corinthians 1.22. [“]For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek
							after wisdom 23. But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
							stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness. 24. But unto them
							which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the
							wisdom of God.” <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> said he should be 2 Sundays absent.</p>

							at 2. O’Clock P.M. which passed by acclamation— A resolution passed by

							been furnished to the old members— Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union, on the contested election bill— <persRef
								ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> in the chair— I had
							taken some part in the discussion upon the first and second Sections, of

							of elections, were adopted—among which was one forbidding the clerk of
							the house to enter on the list of persons presenting themselves as

							insisted upon the previous question which was carried.— The single

							to 82. The report of the Committee of Conference on the army
							organization bill was then taken up and after some debate it was found
							that it must be referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of

							Fillmore moved that the Message should be entered on the journal, and
							printed, and the considera be postponed till to morrow, and moved the

						<p>I had been solicited and urged from various quarters of the house to take
							the lead of the measures to be adopted by the house on the reception of
							the veto message; and yesterday while the house was in committee of the
							whole, the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> came to my seat,
							and asked me to call in at his chamber, for a few minutes after the
							adjournment of the house, which I did. he then again urged me to address
							the house on the reconsideration of the tariff bill— I said I would make
							a speech on the message, and conclude with a motion to refer the message
							to a select committee— I prepared last evening and this morning minutes
							for an hour speech, which I could have expanded at pleasure into a
							speech of two, three or even six or seven hours.— It is the first
							experiment of this that I have made since the establishment of the hour
							rule, and although now but partially successful, I am convinced it might
							by a younger man be improved into a powerful and most effective
							practise.— I called at 9 this morning, at <persRef ref="beard-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard’s</persRef> painting room,
							and told him I had not leisure this day but would give him a sitting
							to-morrow morning— At the house I consumed the hour till the meeting in
							collecting the documents and my thoughts for the speech— After the
							preliminary intrusive matter the morning hour was well occupied with an
							excellent speech on <persRef ref="cooper-james2">Cooper’s</persRef>
							Resolution from the Committee of Indian Affairs against the <persRef
								ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War’s</persRef> suppression of
							evidence— He then moved the previous question as he had promised
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Filmore</persRef> to do— <persRef
								ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> the same man who moved the
							previous question to cut off <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> from his right of self defence, remonstrated
							against the previous question after a party speech— <persRef
								ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef> voted against his own
							motion but it was carried— The question was ordered but not taken, the
							hour having expired— The Speaker then announced the veto Message; I took
							the floor and compressed within one hour, brief and cursory remarks on
							all the topics which I had minuted for discussion.— It was not skilfully
							done; nor with any of the bursts of eloquence, which I have not the
							power to command— Its effect was far more visible upon my adversaries
							than upon my friends— I closed with a motion to refer the message to a
							select Committee of 13 members, with instructions to report thereon.
								<persRef ref="foster-thomas2">Foster</persRef> of Georgia started a
							question of order, denying the power of the house to refer to a
							Committee—what the Constitution required them to reconsider— And now
							commenced a scene of bullying and chicanery by <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef>, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, and <persRef

							hours and after laying on the table three appeals from the Speaker’s
							decisions my motion to refer was carried by yeas and nays 108 to 84. and
							the Bill was laid on the table by 97 to 73— Other business was
							transacted till near 6. p.m. when the house adjourned— I have neither
							time nor space to note particulars— <persRef ref="thornton-anna">M<hi

							because it will prevent a more general and entire revisal and new

							to prepare the Report, but said they would need a similar indulgence of

						<p><date>13. IV:45. </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>I went to the Capitol at 9 this morning, and my niece <persRef
								ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Treadway’s</persRef> daughter, <persRef ref="clark-susan">Susan
								Maria Clark Crane</persRef>, and my granddaughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, rode with me— I had
							promised a sitting to <persRef ref="beard-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Beard</persRef>, and stop’d at his room, but he came out
							and said he was quite unwell and unable to work; so I agreed to defer
							the sitting till Monday—a convenience to me, oppressed as I was with the
							preparation of the report upon the veto message— I was obliged to work
							upon it during the sitting of the house—and could there give little
							attention to any thing else. <persRef ref="hunter-robert">R. M. T.
								Hunter</persRef> presented an Anti-tariff memorial from Virginia
								<persRef ref="summers-george">Summers</persRef> seized a moment of
							the mollia tempora fandi, and worried through the bill for the relief of
								<persRef ref="willis-william3">William Willis</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> persuaded the house to
							discharge the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union from the
							new circuiting bill the object of which I understood from <persRef
								ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> was to deliver Virginia from the
							judicial authority of <persRef ref="daniel-peter">Daniel</persRef> as
							the circuit judge— Barnard carried his motion by suspension of the rules
							and the bill was passed— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>
							bustled and blustered about his bill N. 548. to reduce the pay and
							mileage of members of Congress, but the principal incident of the day
							was the adoption of the 3. Resolutions reported by <persRef
								ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> from the Committee of
							Indian affairs, amended by <persRef ref="caruthers-robert"
								>Caruthers</persRef>, on the report of the <persRef
								ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef> declining to send
							papers called for by resolution of the house— The amendment moved by
							Caruthers to the first Resolution was adopted—then <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett’s</persRef> substitute for the 3 resolutions was rejected 62
							to 104— Then the first Resolution merely declaratory of the right of the
							house to call on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> or
							heads of Departments was carried 142 to 8. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>, <persRef ref="irwin-william">Irwin</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, being 3 of the 8—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> asked to be excused from
							voting, because he could not vote against it as a general declaration,
							and could not vote for it without an implication of censure where he did
							not think it was deserved and he was excused— The second Resolution that
							the call was for papers relating to business before the house and should
							have been communicated was carried 93 to 64— For this Everett voted; but
							on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> and 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d</hi> Resolutions did not vote— The third was a request to the
							President to cause the papers to be communicated to the house—carried 83
							to 60—numerous dodgers on both sides— It is hardly conceivable, how many
							members start back at any approach to gall the kibe of the executive
							chief. There was a flare up, between Arnold and <persRef
								ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef>, upon mutual charges of
							each against the other of being about to join the guard—retracted—
							Adjourned soon after 3— Heard the band on the President’s grounds—
							Heated and flushed with toil.</p>

									>rs</hi> Susan Maria Clark Crane</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> I attended public worship
							this morning at the hall of the house of representatives, where <persRef
								ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef>
							preached from Luke 10.42 [“]But one thing is needful; and <persRef
								ref="mary">Mary</persRef> hath chosen that good part, which shall
							not be taken away from her.” The one thing needful is religion— The
							house as is usual when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffit preaches
							was well filled— After closing his discourse, he sung by himself a short
							methodist hymn.— He gave notice that he should preach a charity Sermon
							this afternoon at Georgetown, observing that it had been by mistake
							announced for last Sunday. That he should preach again in that hall,
							probably for the last time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt’s
							manner of preaching is exceedingly attractive, and yet very much
							censured— It is eminently theatrical—and although the theatre ought to
							be the best school of public speaking, there is a universal prejudice
							against the application of the very best manner of speaking on the stage
							to the pulpit— The impression always is that the preacher is acting a
							part— I believe this to be a prejudice, but am not free from it myself.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt’s manner of preaching,
							approaches the perfection of theatrical declamation— He preaches the
							love of God—obedience to his will—the love of our neighbour,
							benevolence, toleration, charity—all the Christian virtues and graces—
							He preaches the atonement in the blood of Jesus—the divinity of
							Christ—the trinity in unity of the Godhead, and the fall and redemption
							of man— He always commands intense interest and eloquent silence— He
							adverts too frequently and with too much complacency to himself— Upon
							the whole I always hear him—often with pleasure—sometimes I hope with
							profit—never to the detriment of moral principle, or of religious
							faith.— After the morning service, I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="rush-benjamin2">Benjamin</persRef>, son of <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>. There was no Church at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns, and in the afternoon I
							attended, at the second Presbyterian church, and heard a stranger in the
							place of <persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clark</persRef> from Malachi 3.8. [“]Will a man rob God? yet ye have
							robbed me”— This was an objurgative discourse. Evening visits from
								<persRef ref="stjohnmurray-humphrey">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mildmay</persRef> one of <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Lord
								Ashburton’s</persRef> Secretaries, who came to take leave and
							departs to-morrow, and from <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>— The whole of this
							day, save that portion of it devoted to the Sabbath and to visitors, has
							been oppressed even till the midnight hour with labour, in preparing the

							Committee of 13. to morrow morning.</p>

						<p>I closed this morning the report on the Tariff veto bill just in time to

								Lane</persRef>— I read the Report and with two or three slight
							amendments I was authorised by nine members of the Committee to present
							it to the house. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer said he wished to
							present a counter report which he had partly written, but wished a short
							time to finish. It was agreed that he should present his report, at the
							same time when I should present mine.— I proposed to conclude with a
							Resolution to amend the constitution of the United States, so as to make
							a majority of the whole number of members of each house— Several members
							came to me and urged me to present the report this day, but Gilmer came
							and said he was very unwell, and obliged to go home and undergo an
							operation (for the piles) and asked me not to present my report till to
							morrow morning, which I promised— I went to <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> for a set of proposed
							amendments, which he offered some months ago, among which this curb to
							the veto was one—he sent for his budget to his lodgings at Georgetown,
							and when it came I took from it the curtail of the veto, and drew up
							from it an Article of amendment in a few words— Botts had proposed in
							Committee another Resolution that the house have no confidence in
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> or his administration; but
							I objected to it as offering a second and unnecessary issue; and he
							withdrew it. In the house there was a scramble for what bill should be
							taken up. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>
							moved for a suspension of the rules to introduce his multitudinous
							bill—in vain— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> invoked his

								Irwin</persRef> pronounced the name of the Cumberland road bill and

							got up a bill about remedial justice, by 79 to 76. but it was soon
							attacked by <persRef ref="floyd-john3">John G. Floyd</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef>, and laid on the
							table, whence it will never rise again— Sundry-bills reported from the
							Committee on naval affairs were piddled with an hour or two— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> even
							vociferating them up, without forcing progress upon any one of them.
								<persRef ref="binda-giuseppe">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>As I was going out this morning, <persRef ref="royall-anne">M<hi

							<persRef ref="stack-sarah">Sally</persRef> made me a visit after the

							Only four members attended, Adams, <persRef ref="caruthers-robert"
								>Caruthers</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-edward">White</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>— No Quorum—
								<persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef> of the Select Committee on the
							Veto message attended, supposing by mistake that a meeting of that
							Committee this morning had been appointed, at the adjournment yesterday—
							Botts said that he and other members of the majority of the Committee
							wished to sign their names to my Report; and he asked me to give him my
							original draught of the Report, signed by me, which I did, and he,
								<persRef ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef>, Kenneth Rayner,

								<persRef ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef>, Francis Granger,

								ref="morrow-jeremiah">Jeremiah Morrow</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pearce-james">James S. Pearce</persRef>, signed the Report and
							my original draught which Botts said he would keep as the second
							Declaration of Independence. At the Meeting of the House, after some
							intrusive business occupying about half an hour, I read in my seat the
							report signed by ten members of the Committee concluding with a
							Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution— The reading took
							me just three quarters of an hour— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
								>Gilmer</persRef> had announced his Report, and <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> now announced
							that he had a minority report signed by himself and <persRef
								ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> Not a word of this was
							said, in Committee; but I made no objection to its reception— Gilmer
							read his report, which took an hour, and Ingersoll read his in 40
							minutes— A great part of Gilmer’s was a Dissertation to prove the
							unconstitutionality of the appointment of the Committee, and of the
							proceedings of the Committee on the subject.— Ingersoll’s was a lampoon
							upon me in revenge for my blast upon his five points speech— After the
							reading I moved that the three Reports together with the Bill and Veto
							Message be printed and made the special order of the day for to-morrow
							at 12 O’Clock. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> then immediately
							moved to take up the vetoed bill, which the house by yeas and nays 98 to
							104 refused. <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> then
							presented the report of the second Committee of Conference on the army
							organization Bill, which was accepted by the house in four several
							questions contrary to the usage and rule that the report of a committee
							of Conference cannot be amended. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> offered his Bill with a title half a yard long,
							and asked the yeas and nays on its being referred to a select Committee
							and printed. They were 8 to 122. I was one of the minority— <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> moved to take the remedial
							Justice bill out of Committee in two hours—and moved the previous
							question— <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> moved to adjourn

							the proceeds of the sales of the public Lands, and exempting tea and
							Coffee from all duty— After much agitation, the question was taken by

							favour of the measure and it was clear by the result that it will be
							carried. Next <persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef>,
							moved a suspension of the rules to offer a resolution to go into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, to take up house bill
							N. 547 to supply a temporary defect or failure in the laws relating to
							the collection of duties on imports, The yeas and nays on the question

								>Fillmore</persRef> moved a reconsideration of the vote refusing to
							reconsider, and this was carried by a majority less than two thirds 130
							to 70. and then the motion to suspend the rules was again lost, by an
							increased majority 122 to 72.— Noon had come; and I called for the
							special order of the day. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost
								Johnson</persRef> claimed as a privileged right the motion to take
							up the vetoed tariff bill: and the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> recognized his right. I moved to lay his motion
							on the table, but the house refused. They took up the bill— Cost Johnson
							made his speech and urged his creation of two hundred millions of United
							States, 4 per cent stocks, to pay the debts of the States, and to be
							redeemed by the proceeds of the sales of the public lands— When he
							finished <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> moved the
							previous question on the passage of bill, and it was taken as prescribed
							by the Constitution 91 to 87. the same majority by which it originally
							passed in the house— My report and Resolution then came up—the Report
							was adopted by yeas and nays 100 to 80. The Resolution lost by 98 to 90—
								<persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> moved a
							re-consideration of the last vote—made an hour speech against it, and
							withdrew his motion— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved a

								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing’s</persRef> motion the house
							adjourned. It was at the request of <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef> that I modified my motion to include the adoption
							of the report— I told Botts, the majority of the house would not vote to
							adopt the report— He said they would, and they did— <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard</persRef> before the
							Meeting of the house I called in at <persRef ref="keyworth-robert"
								>Keyworth</persRef> the jeweller’s shop and settled with him a small

								ref="keyworth-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Keyworth</persRef>, and as if in <unclear>kind</unclear> and gentle reproach, said he
							believed it was the first time I had ever entered his shop, and it was
							true. The remark put me upon self enquiry why it was; and the answer was
							an aversion to jewellers’ shops as scenes of temptation— Always pinched
							with want of money to pay for the necessaries of life, and bear up under
							the daily burdens of the household, I never have a superfluous dollar to
							offer in jewels or even trinkets to my friends— I have no time now to
							enlarge upon this topic as I might. A <persRef ref="brent-henry"
								>son</persRef> of <persRef ref="brent-w">William Brent</persRef> was
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beard, and was also at work with the
							pallet. It was half past two when I reached the house, and I found
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> on the floor finishing his
							hour invective not only upon me— But the majority of the select
							committee and the house. He was followed by <persRef
								ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef>, a spirit as fiery as
							his own, who began by making Wise disclaim all personal application in
							his bullying defiances, and lashed him with scorpions for an hour—
								<persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>, <persRef ref="colquitt-walter"
								>Colquit</persRef>, continued the debate till <persRef

							upon which I said that the house would see what claim of Justice I had
							for reply, to personal assaults from various quarters; but I would
							rather than occupy the time of the house forbear to assert the claim,
							and acquiesce in the previous question— It was carried, and the
							reconsideration rejected 14 to 140. <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> then moved that the Committees be called for
							Reports I asked that the Report on the Quasi-veto, apportionment bill
							message should be taken up— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> objected— Fillmore from the Committee of Ways and
							Means reported a Resolution, instructing that Committee to report
							speedily another Revenue bill, the same as the one just vetoed,
							excepting the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, and making Tea
							and Coffee duty free— This is the same project presented yesterday by
								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kennon</persRef>— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved

							last taken and the motion was lost 86 to 114. Many of the members on
							both sides withheld their votes at the call of their names; but Wise

						<p>I was roused twice in the Night by severe cramp in the legs, and feel
							that my body and mind are rapidly falling into decay. The position that
							I have taken is arduous enough to crush any man in the vigour of youth;
							but at 75 with failing senses, and blunted instruments surrounded by
							remorseless enemies and false and scary and treacherous friends, how can
							it end but in my ruin?— But I must meet the shock— <persRef
								ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> called on me this morning to say that the
							Messenger from Mexico had arrived, so that in the course of another day
							to two, Committee of foreign Affairs would receive information upon
							which they can decide what to do. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thompson spoke also of the compensation to be fixed by one of the navy
							appropriation bills for the engineers employed in the armed steamers,
							among whom he has <persRef ref="thompson-mangle">one Son</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Connell</persRef> was also here, and thought this was a time for me
							to come forward as a mediator of a compromise between the parties, and
							to surrender the public lands, for a protective tariff— This is
							precisely what is called the Pennsylvania platform, of which we had a
							surfeit this day in the house— My visitors made me tardy at the Meeting
							of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I found a Quorum assembled—

								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, who is busy, jobbing with
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles Ingersoll</persRef> for a
							Tariff without distribution and with Tea and coffee free.— The Committee
							had taken up no business and Cushing had asked time till the next
							Meeting if there should be one to report on the Mexican claims— In the
							house the day was consumed in a struggle, of divided parties for a
							tariff, and surrender of the lands— <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John
								Campbell</persRef> began with a project of a 20 per cent tariff,
							with tea and coffee and an excise on gold and silver. Scouted— Then
							Everett moved a suspension of the rules, with a desperate plunge for the
							aid of the democracy.—lost 81 to 105— Charles J. Ingersoll finally
							worried the house into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> in the
							Chair, and the Committee took up <persRef ref="barnard-daniel"
								>Barnard’s</persRef> bill from the judiciary Committee to supply a

							substitute— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>
							moved his bill, as an entire substitute— Barnard moved an amendment to
							save penalties.— I made a short hour speech against the amendment and
							against the bill; contending that no tariff bill ought to pass at this
							time— <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> and Cushing
							replied to me—wormwood and gall. Granger chastised Cushing, and
							skirmished with <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>— <persRef

								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennon</persRef> blew hot and cold,

								ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							where the Chaplain of the house delivered his valedictory Sermon; from
							Genesis 2.7. “And the Lord God formed man, of the dust of the ground,
							and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
							living soul.” The house was so crowded that with great difficulty we
							obtained seats.— The Sermon was flashy declamation upon mind— He read
							that diamond of inspiration the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians—and closed by singing
							solo as a hymn, “When shall we all meet again.” While he spoke I thought
							his discourse admirable, and his tribute to the members of Congress
							deceased in the course of the Session drew tears from my eyes.— His
							eloquence is the bubbling foam of a shallow stream, rising in mist, and
							irradiated by the Sun beam with all the evanescent colours of the
							rainbow. As he descended from the pulpit, I shook his hand, and thanked
							him for all his labours and services as Chaplain, and particularly for
							the sermon of this day.— In the afternoon I attended at S<hi

							Hawley</persRef>, who has returned from his excursion, read the Evening

							and preached from Hosea 10.1. [“]Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth
							forth fruit unto himself.” As I was returning home I was accosted by a
							stranger who entered into conversation with me, and said his name was
								<persRef ref="wells-jason">Jason B. Wells</persRef>, of the town of
							De Ruyter in the State of New-York; as we came up to my house, I invited
							him in, and he came in and sat in conversation with me about half an
							hour. My health is sinking under the combined pressure of summer heat,
							toil and anxiety— I have daily and nightly warning to be prepared for a
							sudden summons to meet my maker, and yet disregard them all. My hope is
							of Mercy.</p>

							retrenchment bill N. 548 out of Committee of the whole on the state of

							>Gordon</persRef>, kept up a running fire of debate till noon, when the

							offered a succession of amendments which were adopted without
							discussion—the question was taken upon substituting <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef> bill and
							lost— The same fate befell <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

								>M’Kennon’s</persRef> substitute, the vetoed bill, with the

							duty-free, was carried after numerous proposals of amendments, all

							The new bill was reported to the house—the previous question called and
							carried— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> moved to lay the

								ref="thompson-richard">Thompson</persRef> of Indiana moved a

							in counting one affirmative vote had been omitted— The Speaker announced
							a tie 101 to 101. and gave his casting vote against the bill— But the
							motion to reconsider was carried 106 to 98— Then on the second question
							to engross the vote was 103 to 102. announced carried—long debate

								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> who had withheld their votes,
							voted ay and the vote stood 105 to 102 and the deed was done. The long

								<persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>
							one other member and himself had met in the chamber of the Committee of
							foreign Affairs and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing not being
							ready with his report on the Mexican claims they had adjourned without
							waiting for a quorum, till Friday— In the house, <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> proposed a joint resolution,
							instructing the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> to continue experiments for testing <persRef
								ref="colt-samuel">Samuel Colt’s</persRef> submarine battery— He has
							already made two of experiments, one of them yesterday, when he blew up
							a small old vessel, which has cost about 6000 dollars, and now, he wants
							authority to spend many thousand dollars more in experimenting to blow
							up Men of War, by submarine explosion. After some debate the Resolution
							was referred to the Committee of <unclear>foreign</unclear> Affairs— <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> struggled hard to get up a bill for remedial
							justice and after a failure of a quorum, a call of the house, a motion
							to lay the bill on the table, and the yeas and nays twice taken, he
							carried, 75 to 54 the resolution to take the bill out of Committee, one
							hour after it shall be the next time considered—but he omitted to name
							the day and could not prevail on the Committee of the whole on the state
							of the Union to take up the bill— The house finally went into Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union at the motion of <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>, and took up the general
							Post-Office Bill— This is a Bill of details of many Post officers, newly
							established and a small number discontinued— The bill was read through
							by sections, and many members were dissatisfied with the decisions of
							the Committee— More than all <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee who complained bitterly of the
							discontinuance of a Post route in his District— The quorum failed three
							or four times— Arnold would not suffer any question to be taken without
							a Quorum—and time after time the chairman reported the fact to the
							house; a call of the house was moved and carried pursued till 8 or ten
							members beyond a quorum answered—then the call was superseded—the
							Chairman of the Committee of the whole took the chair, and in five
							minutes time, another question arose upon which no quorum voted, and the
							same scene was enacted over again— This trifling was carried on, till
							four O’Clock when the Committee rose and reported the bill to the house,
							and soon after the house adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber and
							spoke to <persRef ref="bates-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bates</persRef>, and <persRef ref="archer-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Archer</persRef> in behalf of <persRef

							of his pension and they both promised their aid to carry his bill
							through the Senate as <persRef ref="summers-george">M<hi

							calling for copies of <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass’s</persRef>
							protest against the ratification by France of the quintuple Treaty of
							the Treaty itself and of all the correspondence relating to it— The
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> had declined
							communicating those papers then; alledging that no official copy of the
							quintuple Treaty had been received, and that the other papers requested
							could not consistently with the public interest be communicated then but
							he hoped they might be, soon— This message had been referred by the

								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> had enquired if I should be willing to see the
							Secretary of State on the subject, to which I had readily agreed— He
							said there might be inconvenience in the publication before the treaty
							shall come back from England, ratified— And then the whole
							correspondence would be published— And in the meantime if I desired it
							they should be communicated to me in confidence.— He said they had a
							copy of the quintuple Treaty though not communicated to them officially—
							He spoke with great severity of the conduct both of Cass and of <persRef

						<p>I have neither time nor space for commenting upon, or even for stating

							Resolution offered yesterday, to stop hereafter the pay of absentee
							members of the House of Representatives would furnish matter for four

							that the proceedings of both houses upon the resolution might be
							correctly reported— The report in the Intelligencer of this morning of

							report at-all of the proceedings in the Senate— This morning <persRef
								ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. L.
								Thompson</persRef> called on me to mention that he had made a
							discovery of a fund of upwards of a million of dollars in the Navy

							be made to the report and Cushing was authorised to make it, if approved
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett and myself.— Adjourned to meet
							again next Tuesday if Congress should still be then in Session— In the
							house the approaching close of the Session was manifested, by the
							transaction of much helter skelter business— <persRef ref="gwin-william"
								>Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi continued to teaze the house with the
							most perverse perseverance to pass the bill to give a gratuity of about
							4000 dollars under colour of refunding to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef> a fine levied upon him by <persRef
								ref="hall-dominic">Judge Hall</persRef> at New-Orleans, in 1815—
							This is a crumb of political swindling got up by <persRef
								ref="davizac-august">Davezac</persRef> a profligate French Creole of
							New-Orleans, now commorant in the City of New-York, and disgracing it as
							one of its representatives in the State Legislature— Gwin has been
							harassing the house day after day to get up this bill reported by three
							out of nine members of the judiciary committee with a characteristic
							five points report by <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef>— Gwin failed to get up the bill this day but it
							will be carried in the next Congress, if not in the next Session.— Two
							notable bills were driven through the house this day. One to repeal the
							proviso to the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the Act of 4.
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1841. suspending the distribution
							of the proceeds of the Land-sales, among the States— The bill finally

							also crowded by a rallying of the whigs, first through the Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph"
								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> in the Chair, and finally through the

						<p>The Calms and breathless summer heats of the Nights continue with

							a bill to compound with the sureties of <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel"
								>Samuel Swartwout</persRef> late collector at New-York and a
							defaulter for 6 or 1200000 dollars— After a sharp struggle of sundry

							bills at the third reading—then those in Committee of the whole on the

								<persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> objected to the bill

							the negroes, nor his money returned to him[)]— I objected to it again—
							On one taking of the yeas and nays there were 156 votes—there had been
							yesterday one of 190. but almost all the business done in Committees of
							this day there were not more than half a quorum of members present— When
							the bill in Committee of the whole were gone through a motion was made
							to rise and report the bills. <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> rose and objected that there was no quorum
							present, Linn said he must report the bills— Arnold appealed from the

							know nothing of what had passed in Committee but from the report of the
							Chairman, and he proceeded to put the question on the first of the

							my regret that the chairman and the Speaker had both dealt so roughly
							with Arnold. The vote on the division was 40 to 15—only 55 members
							voting.— There was a call of the house and a quorum formed— Adjourned

							24 to 23.— <persRef ref="bradford-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>28. V:30. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>There was no preaching this day at the Capitol, wherefore I attended the
							morning service of public worship at the second presbyterian church— The
							same person preached whom I had heard last Sunday afternoon, the Pastor,
							the <persRef ref="clark-rufus">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Rufus
								W. Clark</persRef> being absent on a tour for his health— This
							Gentleman’s text this day was from John 6.44. [“]No man can come to me,
							except the Father which hath sent me draw him”; he omitted the remainder
							of the verse—“and I will raise him up, at the last day.” This is an
							awfully mysterious chapter— In which Jesus revealed himself to his
							disciples in assertions of unlimited power; in language professedly
							spiritual, but so unusually figurative, and so obscurely foreshadowed,
							that many of the disciples of Jesus, departed from him offended at the
							<unclear>immensurate members</unclear> which he put forth—telling them that they must eat
							his flesh, and drink his blood— Of all this our preacher took no sort of
							notice; but in commenting upon the necessity of God’s drawing men to
							Christ, he fell into a fervid exhortation to his hearers to suffer
							themselves to be drawn without delay—and then by way of ascending climax
							he said God the father says—delay not— Our Lord Jesus Christ says—delay
							not— The holy Spirit says delay not— Hell says delay not— The devil says
							delay not— Come oh come to Christ! Was it possible to refrain from
							laughter. After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Welbur</persRef>
							read the Evening prayers for the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sunday
							after Trinity, and preached from Matthew 17.1 <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>After</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">these</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">things</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">Jesus</hi> “And after six days, Jesus taketh
								<persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, <persRef ref="james"
								>James</persRef>, and <persRef ref="john">John</persRef> his
							brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 2. and was
							transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sun, and his
							raiment was white as the light. 3. And behold, there appeared unto them
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and <persRef ref="elijah"
								>Elias</persRef>, talking with him 4. Then answered Peter, and said
							unto him Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt let us make
							here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
							Elias 5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
							and, behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved
							Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.” This is the scene of the
							Transfiguration, a subject too weighty for an afternoon Sermon— After
							the service, I called at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s,</persRef> but he had
							rode out, and had taken the key of the outside door with him— I

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Graham</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="tayloe-virginia">Miss Virginia Tayloe</persRef>

						<p>The closing days of a Session of Congress are always days of extreme
							confusion— This is one of them, but we have only two more of them in
							prospect at present— The House had sent to the Senate a joint Resolution
							for adjournment on this day— The Senate took it up this morning, and
							passed it, changing the day to Wednesday next 2. O’Clock PM. and the
							house concurred with this Amendment— A motion was made by <persRef
								ref="gamble-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gamble</persRef>
							of Georgia to reconsider this vote, but no vote was taken upon it— In
							the house, <persRef ref="botts-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Botts</persRef> moved a Resolution to give an additional gratuity of
							250 dollars to the <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Septimus Tustin</persRef>, Chaplain
							to the Senate for his services during this interminable Session—
							Objection was made— Botts moved to suspend the rules, but could not
							carry it— It was observed that the motion did not include a similar
							gratuity to <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maffitt</persRef> the Chaplain of the house— The tariff bill came
							back from the Senate with numerous amendments, adopted after an
							obstinately contested debate last Saturday evening 24 to 23.— The
							progress of the Tariff controversy exhibits a signal exemplification of
							what I have long and often remarked as a law of political gravitation as
							uniform in its operation as that other gravitation which governs the
							system of the Universe— It is that of all great systems of policy
							maintained by antagonist parties and subject to deliberative decision
							the opposite practical measures are modified into mutual approximation,
							till they come to a balance turned by a single vote. So has it
							pre-eminently been, in this revenue bill— In the house of
							Representatives it was twice pronounced rejected and finally carried by
							a majority of two votes in 208— In the Senate it has been finally
							carried by a majority of one vote—when it came back, before the question
							of concurring with the Senate’s amendments was taken <persRef
								ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> moved to lay the bill on
							the table— But so little disposed to this was the same house, where a
							majority of 2 had been so recently extorted by a convulsion that upon
							the motion now to lay the bill and amendments on the table, the yeas and
							nays were but 65 to 120.— The amendments of the Senate were all adopted
							in a lump, without a division of the house, and a reconsideration moved
							by <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennon</persRef> to be rejected was
							rejected in the same manner— A great mass of other business was
							transacted in Committee of the whole, on the state of the Union <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> in the Chair,
							among which was a Treasury Note Bill for 6. Millions, and a concurrence

							Resolutions three of which in the same words with those adopted by the
							Senate in April 1834 on receiving a similar protest from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, for which
							Resolutions John Tyler and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel
								Webster</persRef> both voted. Botts read large extracts from an
							eloquent Speech of Webster on that occasion moved a fourth resolution,
							that the Clerk of the house be directed to return Tyler’s protest to its
							author.— The first three Resolutions were adopted 87 to 46. 86 to 48 and
							86 to 53. I declined voting upon the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							which was lost 62 to 69. Other business occupied the house till half
							past 6 when the adjourned for lack of a Quorum.</p>

						<p>Close of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Session of the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress.</p>
						<p>My brother <persRef ref="adams-charles">Charles’s</persRef> daughter
								<persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Susan
								Boylston Treadway</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef
								ref="clark-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Susan Maria Clark
								Crane</persRef>, with her infant son <persRef ref="crane-charles"
								>Charles</persRef> and a black Nurse named <persRef ref="julia2"
								>Julia</persRef>, left us, and embarked at 6 this morning in the
							Steamer for Richmond, Virginia where <persRef ref="crane-adoniram">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crane</persRef> resides.— I went down
							with my Grand daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>,
							to the boat with them, and introduced to them <persRef ref="botts-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Botts</persRef> who had promised
							me to pay all suitable attention to them— <persRef
								ref="arrington-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Arrington</persRef> and <persRef ref="mckay-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kay</persRef>, members of the house
							from North-Carolina, were also in the Boat. The closing day of a Session
							of Congress is always a day of reckless confusion, and to me of distress
							and mortification. It was pre-eminently so this day.— <persRef
								ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> made an appropriate parting prayer. As soon as the
							journal was read, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved to
							amend it by inserting the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President’s</persRef> Message of Protest in extenso— Wise thought
							to get it on to the Journal by this trick, but the house having declared
							yesterday by Resolution that it should not be entered on the Journal,
							were not thus to be baffled of their purpose— There was a precedent
							precisely in point in the New-Jersey election case at the first Session
							of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress; upon the notification
							of which by the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise he asked and obtained leave to
							withdraw his motion.— From that time till half past two O’Clock the time
							was spent in calls of the house to obtain a Quorum—in passing rejecting
							or laying on the table bills and resolutions, with or without a quorum,
							in taking yeas and nays, counting by tellers, and driving through or
							defeating as the humour happened to work— An appropriation of 6000
							dollars by joint resolution was forced through by the Speaker against my
							earnest and repeated remonstrances— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost
								Johnson</persRef>, <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef> each gave notice that he should start his favourite hobby at an
							early day of the next Session; and <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">T. F. Marshall</persRef> gave notice that he
							should oppose Cushing’s exchequer, and <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennon</persRef> gave notice that he
							should oppose Arnold’s bill N. 548. The usual messages at the close of
							the Session were interchanged, and at half past 2 pm the Speaker
							adjourned the house to the first Monday in December next— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith returned this morning from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye’s</persRef>. I called at <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse’s</persRef> Office
							this morning—and he called this afternoon on me. I had an evening visit
							also from my next door neighbour <persRef ref="parris-albion">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris</persRef>,
							and from <persRef ref="lamb-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. F. Lamb</persRef>.</p>
