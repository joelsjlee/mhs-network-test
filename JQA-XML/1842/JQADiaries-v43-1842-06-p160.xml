						<p>I went this morning with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.
								Adams</persRef> to the Railway Cars, which departed at 6 O’Clock for
							Baltimore; we took up <persRef ref="adams-joseph">her brother</persRef>
							at his lodgings, <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Gates</persRef> a member of the house from western New-York with his
							Sister— He is in very feeble health and since the death of <persRef

								ref="sollers-augustus">Sollers</persRef> a young member from

							1795 and 6. now a decrepid old man, over 60. <persRef ref="holmes-isaac"
								>Holmes</persRef> called me out from my seat two days ago to renew
							acquaintance with him— <persRef ref="newcomb-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Warren Newcomb</persRef>
							Grandson of <persRef ref="warren-joseph2">General Joseph
								Warren</persRef> who fell at Bunker’s Hill called on me this morning
							to solicit my assistance to effect the passage of a bill in his favour
							reported by <persRef ref="parmenter-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Parmenter</persRef> from the Committee of revolutionary
							claims—N. 435. General Warren left four children, <persRef
								ref="warren-joseph3;warren-richard">two sons</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="welles-elizabeth;newcomb-mary">two daughters</persRef>, who by
							Resolutions of Congress were educated at the public expense. The claim
							is for seven years half pay pledged by a Resolution of 24. Aug<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> 1780. to the widows and children of
							officers dying in the service— Newcomb is the son of Mary the youngest
							daughter, and is the only living descendant from General Warren.
								<persRef ref="ford-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ford</persRef> a Messenger from the General Land Office brought me
							150 dollars in Treasury Notes and 43. in a check upon the Bank of the

									>r</hi> Van Ness</persRef> came to enquire what has been done in
							the Committee of foreign affairs, upon <persRef ref="triplett-philip"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Triplet’s</persRef> resolution
							concerning his accounts; upon which I told him that the Committee had
							not yet come to any conclusion.— At the house— The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> presented a Letter from <persRef
								ref="middleton-arthur">Arthur Middleton</persRef> late chargé
							d’Affaires in Spain, presenting a portrait of <persRef
								ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef>, the only authentic
							one extant— The letter and portrait were referred to the Committee on
							the library. This was the first of the two days specially reserved by a
							resolution of the house for the consideration of bills relating to the
							District of Columbia, and <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> Chairman of the District brought them forward.
							and the spirit of chicanery was instantly at work against them— It began
							by defeating the passage of the bill for the relief of the district
							banks; crippled several others, and forced a premature adjournment, by
							failure of a Quorum on taking the question upon an amendment moved by
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, introducing
							universal white suffrage for the election of Mayor and Councilmen the
							vote was 58 to 57. Call of the house refused— Adjourned.— My diary runs
							irresistibly into arrears; and this evening I was compelled to desist
							from writing by a sick and faint turn which came over me.</p>

						<p>I found myself this morning restored to my usual state of health, but
							distracted by the multitude of occupations, newspapers and visitors.—
								<persRef ref="tileston-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tileston</persRef>, is a manufacturer of paper at Milton and
							Dorchester adjoining the town of Quincy, and is here to watch the
							passage of the tariff bill— The manufacture of paper is one of those to
							which the protective duties are indispensable— They are already
							perishing under the operation of the compromise of 1833. and he fears
							that under the present prospects of a tariff there is imminent danger
							that his own establishment and all the other papers-mills of this
							Country will be swept away— I could offer him no consolation. <persRef
								ref="parker-peter">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef>
							came to take leave of me, being on the point of his departure for return
							to China. I told him that after the conversations he held with me last
							Summer; an enquiry was made of me, whether if an Embassy should be
							instituted, and the mission should be offered to me, I would accept the
							appointment.— I answered that if the question should be put to me from a
							quarter authorised to make the offer— I heard no more of that project,
							and all idea of carrying it into execution was abandoned— My own opinion
							was that such a mission was inexpedient. But it was and is my opinion
							that an intelligent and discreet and spirited informal commissioner
							ought to have been and to be there, with full power to take advantage of
							any incident which might occur to open a communication with the Chinese
							Government to sustain and promote the interests political and commercial
							of our country. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker said he entirely
							concurred in that opinion, and said he would add that he had seen the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> who assured him that
							he had his eye fixed upon China, and would avail himself of any
							favourable opportunity to commence a negotiation with the celestial
							Empire— <persRef ref="newton-washingon">Lieutenant Newton</persRef> of

						<p><persRef ref="fletcher-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Fletcher</persRef> is a magnificent projector— He sent me this
							morning a copy of a Letter he had written containing a plan for
							establishing a number, I think twenty missionary stations from the rocky
							mountains to the mouth of Columbia river, with a colonial settlement at
							each station. He requested my opinion of this plan, and if I approved,
							wished me to recommend it— He said he would call in the course of the
							morning for my answer, and came accordingly— I told him I had very
							peculiar notions about settlements beyond the rocky mountains and had
							become exceedingly skeptical of their expediency; especially at this
							time when it would be likely to lead us into a collision with
							Great-Britain— That however suitable his plan might be at another time,
							and under other circumstances, I could not recommend it now— <persRef
								ref="brown-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

							to open a lucrative and increasing commerce— He says he has almost a
							promise from <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler</persRef>, of the
							nomination.— At the house <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett

							accommodate him reduced his two resolutions into one— Proffit called for
							the yeas and nays, but they were refused. the rules were suspended; and

						<p>I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis, and received in
							bills of that bank 40 dollars and 3 dollars in silver, for the check
							sent me by <persRef ref="fitzhugh-m">M. Fitzhugh</persRef> in part
							payment of the due bills which I had received from <persRef
								ref="morsell-richard">R. I. Morsell</persRef> on the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of April. I enquired whether they now
							paid the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker’s</persRef> checks in specie
							or their own bills, or in treasury Notes—they said in either at the
							option of the receiver— I called next at the Treasury Department, and
							enquired of <persRef ref="forward-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forward</persRef>, concerning the Resolution of the House calling
							for an exposition of the debts of the States— He called for the <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">chief clerk Young</persRef>, who said there
							were yet two States, Louisiana and<space/>from which no returns have been
							received— I proposed that the report should be made, with inofficial
							statements of the debts of the two States which have not made returns.—
							But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward directed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Young to write to the Senators from the
							two States and request the information from them. He said the Treasury
							Notes which were payable on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							April, and those which will be payable the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> instant shall be paid— At the house a Louisiana land-bill
							was by the importunity of <persRef ref="dawson-john2">Dawson</persRef>
							taken from Committee of the whole and made the special order of the day
							for this day week— A Letter from the <persRef ref="spencer-john"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>, was yesterday presented by the Speaker
							and read in the house declining to communicate certain documents
							disclosing scandalous frauds of public men in transaction, with the
							Cherokee Indians, called for by a Resolution of the House of 18 May
							moved by <persRef ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef>, chairman
							of the Committee of Indian Affairs.— Cooper yesterday moved the
							reference of the Secretary’s Letter to that Committee and made some
							severe remarks upon the refusal of the documents— The house had
							adjourned without taking the question upon the reference, to which
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> had moved the
							addition of Instructions to enquire and report upon the expediency of
							further action of the house upon the subject— When it was called up this
							morning, Cushing having been absent when Cooper made his remarks
							yesterday requested him to repeat them which he did— Cushing then took
							up the cudgels for the Executive power, and stoutly defended the right
							of the Executive to refuse documents demanded by the house, charging
							usurpation upon the house for demanding them— He referred emphatically
							to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> works. 4.464.
							as to a precedent decisive of the question. I answered him and took
							issue upon his principles. I referred to the message of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef> in 1796—and
							the two Resolutions of the House thereon— Spencer’s Letter was referred
							to the Indian Committee; but without Cave Johnson’s Instructions.—
							Committee of the whole on the state of Union, <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> in the Chair; in spite of
								<persRef ref="cowen-benjamin">Cowen’s</persRef> remonstrance— Army
							appropriation Bill Long speech of <persRef ref="pope-john"
								>Pope</persRef>, for the reduction of the army— <persRef
								ref="yulee-david">David Levy</persRef> delegate from Florida,
							loquacious against it— Sputter of Cushing against <persRef

							escapes are always upon by way’s. Levy did not finish— Walk home.</p>

						<p>The musical band of the Marine corps have commenced their summer
							exercises of performing martial airs for the entertainment of the public
							twice a week at the going down of the Sun—on Thursdays in front of the
							Capitol, and on Saturdays on the grounds before the back portico of the
							President’s house. I went there alone after dinner last evening and
							heard them for about an hour before and after the setting of the Sun—
							The company assembled was not so numerous as usual, and I knew very few
							of them except the straggling members of Congress, with or without
							Ladies— I met there, and walked with <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>— This morning I
							attended public worship at the Hall of the House of Representatives,
							where <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> was on duty; but the services were performed by the
								<persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tolmage</persRef> said to be President
							of a College in Georgia—his sermon was from 1. John 2.15. [“]Love not
							the world, neither the things that are in the world— If any man love the
							world the love of the father is not in him”— It was a discourse quite
							appropriate to the place in which it was delivered; and to the supposed
							auditory, consisting as it should, chiefly of members of Congress— This
							is the principle upon which the appointment of chaplains is justifiable
							and proper; and I consider it as one of my public duties as a
							representative of the people to give my attendance every Sunday morning
							when divine service is performed in the hall.— The preacher of this day
							contrasted the love of the world with the love of God—a copious but a
							hacknied subject; on which nothing new can be said, but upon which the
							same that has been repeated a thousand times may properly be repeated
							again— There is a long and pungent satire of Juvenal, upon the vanity
							and disappointments of human wishes—and the first line of the Satires of
							Persias—[“]O! curas hominum! O! quantum est in rebus inane” comprizes
							the whole system of desponding philosophy.— The philosophy of an earlier
							age professed by the Grecian <persRef ref="heraclitus"
								>Heraclitus</persRef>— Jesus and his religion first modified and
							moralized it by presenting it in contrast with the love of God— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tolmage’s delivery was indifferent,
							accompanied with a disagreeabe drawl, and yet considerably spirited— He
							gave out <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> 100<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, by the name of the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> hymn— The house was thin— <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef> came to me and said that his friends had recalled
							him, not being able to raise funds sufficient to defray his necessary
							expences here; and that he thought of leaving the city, next Thursday.—
							This afternoon I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							church. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for the second Sunday
							after Trinity, and preached from Psalm 68.18. [“]Thou hast ascended on
							high: thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men:
							yea for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among men.”

						<p>From this day forward, for the remnant of the Session the daily meeting
							of the house is to be at 10. O’Clock A.M. At half past 9. I was about
							stepping into my carriage to go to the house when two morning visitors
							came in; one of them from Florida, wishing to have some conversation
							with me concerning the state of affairs in that territory— I could not
							wait and appointed to morrow evening for him to call on me again— I was
							however so delayed; that I found the house in session, and <persRef
								ref="yulee-david">David Levy</persRef> concluding his declamation
							against the reduction of the army. <persRef ref="cowen-benjamin"
								>Cowan</persRef> had given notice of his intention to move a revival
							of the hour rule. When David had expatiated about an hour, <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> attempted to take the
							floor, but <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and I had
							both taken it— Fillmore yielded it to me, and I to Everett, who spoke
							about a quarter of an hour, professing a very earnest desire for the
							reduction of the army, but declaring that he should vote against the
							amendments proposed to this bill, because it was not the place nor the
							form in which the reduction was to be effected— He said too that this
							reduction was recommended by the Committee on the public expenditures
							which had no jurisdiction in the case— The Military Committee being that
							which should have reported upon it.— I spoke about an hour and a half
							for the amendment and the reduction of the army—admitting that this was
							not the bill nor the form in which the good work ought to have been
							accomplished; but saying that I must sacrifice form to substance, and
							take in any form the good which I could not effect in my own way—
								<persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> replied to me with
							great power till one O’Clock when the debate was to cease— <persRef
								ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> offered a compromise
							amendment to fix the army at its present numbers without further
							increase on reduction—lost by tellers 69 to 102— <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson’s</persRef> amendment modified by
							mine was carried in two divisions 1. to reduce the Artillery and
							Infantry regiments to the standard of 1821. 102 to 64. and 2. to
							withhold pay after the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September
							next from the second Regiment of dragoons 91 to 62.— other amendments

						<p>Three of the work men on the public buildings called on me again this
							morning to solicit my assistance to obtain an appropriation for giving
							them employment, by authorising the addition to the Treasury building of
							a wing, essentially necessary for the offices of that department— They
							feared that the <persRef ref="boardman-william">chairman of the
								Committee on the public buildings</persRef> was opposed to making
							the appropriation; and complained that their families were suffering
							severely—that others had left the city and were wandering about the
							country seeking work and bread, and several had gone to New-York where
							they had found it as impossible to find work as here. Meeting of the
							Committee of foreign affairs— Present Adams, <persRef

								>Granger</persRef>— We had only half an hour before the meeting of
							the house— The Committee therefore agreed to meet henceforth twice a
							week at 9. A.M.—and after further consideration of the accounts and
							claims of <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef>—and
							decided upon the several contested items of the account, adjourned to
							meet next Friday morning, charging the chairman to arrange and assort
							the subjects under reference to the committee that they may be taken up
							and acted upon in their order. In the house, <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> from the Committee of Ways
							and Means reported a Bill to continue the existing duties of impost,
							till the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August next— Read twice and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.
							Cushing called up his motion to print 5000 extra copies of the New-York
							Custom-house reports, which he claimed as privileged immediately after
							the passage of the army appropriation bill. <persRef ref="davis-garrett"
								>Garrett Davis</persRef> contested this claim— The <persRef

							first lost 97 to 98.—reconsidered 94 to 88—and carried 94 to 93. other

							laid before the house sundry executive documents and a memorial from

							remnant of the proviso; and he merely asked whether that motion was in

							building; for the preservation and arrangement of the objects of
							curiosity collected by the exploring expedition under <persRef
								ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant Wilkes</persRef>, now daily expected
							home— And he called on me to say how far my purposes may be concurrent
							with these suggestions— I said I had the warmest disposition to favour
							them, and thought there was but one difficulty in the way, which might
							perhaps be surmounted— I had believed that the whole burden and the
							whole honour of the Smithsonian institution should be exclusively
							confined to itself; and not entangled or commingled with any national
							establishment requiring appropriations of public money. I exposed the
							principles upon which all my movements relating to the Smithsonian
							bequest have been founded as well as the bills which at four successive
							Congresses I have reported first for obtaining the money and then for
							disposing of the fund— At the motion of <persRef ref="walker-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker</persRef> of Mississippi,
							the President Poinsett was authorised to appoint a Committee of five
							members of the institute, to confer with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Preston and me upon the means of connecting the Smithsonian institution
							with the national institute— This morning I called at the Treasury

							the State of Louisiana,—and it consumed the day. <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> the rabid democrat,

							is but a perpetual exemplification, infinitely diversified of the
							goodness, and the severity of God. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tustin’s illustrations were accordingly collected from all those

						<p>I called this morning at the Bank of the Metropolis, deposited there the
							Treasury Warrant for 742 dollars that I had received last Saturday and
							drew a check for 300 dollars in the bills of the bank, which I exchanged
							at <persRef ref="nourse-charles">C. J. Nourse’s</persRef> Office for

								>Stanly</persRef> presented a second self-indicatory letter of
								<persRef ref="poindexter-george">Poindexter</persRef>, upon which
							that house took no orders not even to lay it on the table— I offered the

							for copies of the quintuple treaty for the suppression of the African
							Slave trade of <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Cass’s</persRef> protest
							against it and the correspondence with him and with France concerning

								ref="pendleton-nathanael">Pendleton</persRef> moved an addition to

							call for the previous question to debates in Committee of the whole. The

								>Botts</persRef> afterwards moved a reconsideration of that vote

								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef> the fine of 1000

							been upwards of three months referred to the Committee on the judiciary—
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> wanted to
							claim the floor to take to himself the blame of not having reported the

							the Senate’s first amendment—the ratio—and to concur with the second,
							the representation of fractions— The debate consumed the day.— The house
							maintaine their own ratio by yeas and nays 112 to 95. and adjourned.

							wrangling debate, the question of reconsideration was taken by yeas and

							amendment of the Senate providing for the representation of fractions,
							by allowing one additional member for every State whose fraction will
							amount to more than half the standard number— <persRef
								ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi, moved to
							strike out one half, and insert thirty thousand maintaining that the
							fraction of less than thirty thousand would conflict with the letter of
							the constitution— I argued that the main reason assigned by <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>, rested
							avowedly on a construction of the words in the constitution, which I
							thought not correct; and I shewed that by allowing the representation
							for the fractions, with our standard there would be 11. additional
							members representing 558<space/>constituents, the aggregate of all the
							fractions, and far from bringing any member within the limit of 30000
							souls would give to each member more than the standard of 50179—But
								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef>, made a

							connected with the alteration of the standard number, were all rejected
							by one motion to disagree to all of them; and then a Resolution offered

						<p><persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant Wilkes</persRef>, in his
							conversation with me last evening complained bitterly of the reception
							which he had met from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of the
								United States</persRef> and the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef>— He that his name had been omitted from the
							list of nominations for promotion in the Navy recently submitted by the
							President to the Senate; while the name of <persRef
								ref="guillou-charles">an Officer</persRef> whom he had been obliged
							to send home under arrest had been included in it— That Officer, while
							under arrest had been permitted to present charges utterly frivolous and
							futile against him; and contrary to the first principles of Justice and
							what he believed the universal usage, those charges had been
							entertained— All the other Officers and men returned from the expedition
							returning after three years of hardships, toils and dangers had
							naturally expected to be welcomed home, with some cheering smile, and
							some kind word from the Government of their Country— They had found
							instead of this a cold and insulting silence.— Had this ungenerous
							treatment been confined to himself he would have borne it with patience;
							but extended as it was to all the gallant and meritorious men, and to
							the accomplished Officers and Artists and Men of Science, whose labours
							had atchieved results of which they might well be proud, it had
							overpowered him; and all the anxieties and cares and suffering of the
							whole three years were as nothing to the anguish he had endured within
							the last five days.— I said little in answer to him, but must wait to
							hear the statements of the other side.</p>
						<p>At the house, after two or three Resolutions offered and adopted or laid
							over and two or three bills reported, the provisional Tariff bill,
							extending the collection of duties till the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of August, and repealing the suspension of the
							distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands, was taken
							up in committee of the whole, on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> an excellent chairman in

							and that was sharply debated by <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

								ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef> till 2. O’Clock, fixed
							for taking the question numerous captious amendments were then
							successively proposed and rejected— The question upon striking out the
							proviso was lost by yeas and nays 107 to 113— The bill was then ordered
							to be engrossed, and passed by yeas and nays 116 to 103.— <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> then called up the
							apportionment bill, returned from the Senate, insisting upon the
							amendments disagreed to by the house— Everett moved to receive and
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved the previous
							question—the house refused to recede by yeas and nays 184 to 110. W.
							Cost Johnson moved to adhere; but the house refused that 80 to 127.
							Adjourned. On coming home I found a note from <persRef

							of 101— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> then moved to

								Connel</persRef>l was here this morning to enquire what I proposed

							spoliations before 1801. I said I should either move to take it up in
							committee of the whole on the state of the Union this day, or give
							notice that I shall make that motion next Saturday. I called at the
							Treasury Office and enquired concerning the report on the call for a
							statement of the amount and condition of the State debts. <persRef
								ref="young-mcclintock">M’Clintock Young</persRef> told me that they
							had not yet received returns from New-York or Louisiana— That they had
							written a second time to the <persRef ref="seward-william">Governor of
								New-York</persRef> who in reply stated that he had forwarded
							returns; but they had never been received— Young said he believed they
							must answer the call to the extent of the returns which they have, the
							remainder to be furnished as they may come in— I told him that if the
							distribution of the proceeds of the public lands to the States should be
							made on the first of next month, I shall want tabular statements of the
							amount paid to each State, and of the amount retained in payment of
							interest on the bonds of States due to the United States— I received at

							about Liberty and the natural, inalienable rights of man, as if there
							was not a Slave in his State or in this District— If I had said one word
							about Slavery I should have had the whole pack of Southern Doulocracy
							and Northern Servility upon me; produced merely a brawl, and been
							branded as a fire brand, in my own land of the pilgrims— I retired in
							utter disgust without the bar, and suffered this paroxism of frenzy for
							the rights of man, to liberate one Louisiana constituent of Edward D.
							White, from imprisonment for want of bail, leaving six thousand Slaves

									M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edgar</persRef> of Nashville
							Tennessee, upon Matthew 11. and 6. “And blessed is he, whosoever shall
							not be offended in me.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edgar can hardly
							yet be called an elderly man— He is a handsome speaker, with a strong,
							clear voice a good delivery, plain piety, sound sense, and rational
							religion— He did not allude to the circumstances under which the words
							were spoken; nor attempt to explain the reason why <persRef
								ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef>, who at his first
							meeting with Jesus had so emphatically proclaimed him the lamb of God,
							who taketh away the sins of the world, should afterwards have sent from
							prison to enquire of Jesus, art thou he that should come, or do we look
							for another? <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef> 36<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon is upon the same text; and I
							thought he had accounted for this message from the baptist, as an
							indirect appeal to Jesus, to release him from prison by a miracle—the
							liberation of prisoners being from the prophesy of Isaiah 61.1.2 the
							special object of the mission of the Messiah— But on referring to
							Sterne’s Sermon, I find that although it does allude to the message from
							John, it does not account for it, nor mark the peculiar point of
							Christ’s answer, with reference to John’s own situation as prompter to
							the message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edgar confined himself to
							enumerating the causes of taking offence with the Christian religion:
							and with exhortation to the duty of forbearing to take such offence—his
							argument might have been greatly fortified by illustrations of
							comparison and contrast between the causes of offence in the Christian
							now operating upon the hearts and minds of men, and that against which
							the answer of Jesus admonished John to be upon his guard— I cannot
							pursue this disquisition— This afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the evening
							service for the fourth Sunday after Trinity; but as he ascended the

							that he could not see to read his manuscript, and after a few words of
							prayer he dismissed the congregation, but for nearly half an hour,
							floods of rain continued to fall and locked up the auditory within the
							church. As it subsided, I passed over to <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson’s</persRef> house and spent a couple hours of conversation
							with him— I then walked home, where I found my nephew, <persRef

							soon after <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							called on me yesterday morning just as I was going out to the capitol,
							and asked me if I could let him have the Letter which he wrote me early
							in 1838. when he furnished me copies of his Letter to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> of 2. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> 1830. and of that of 10. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1830. from Jackson to <persRef
								ref="fulton-william">W. Fulton</persRef> then Secretary of the
							Territory of Arkansas— I told him that if I had received from him such a
							Letter, of which my recollection was indistinct it must be on my files
							of Letters of the year 1838 which were at Quincy. That of course I could
							not furnish the Letter now, but on my return to Quincy, I expected I
							could find it, in which case it should be at his service— The verdict of
							the jury in the Doctor’s suit for a libel against <persRef
								ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john"
								>Rives</persRef> editors of the globe, was against him— He says that
							his Counsel <persRef ref="coxe-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coxe</persRef>, will move the Court for a new trial, on the ground
							that the verdict was against Law and evidence, and has no doubt that he
							will succeed— He intimated that the affidavit of <persRef
								ref="westcott-james">James D. Westcott </persRef>in 1830, Secretary
							in the Territory of Florida and himself an enormous speculation in Texas
							adventure had operated much against him before the jury, and he left a
							copy of it with me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Westcott says he was
							perfectly well acquainted with <persRef ref="houston-samuel"
								>Houston’s</persRef> projects in 1829, for the emancipation of Texas
							and largely shared in them but that he never received from President
							Jackson such a Letter as that to Fulton— This morning I called at the
							Treasury Department to enquire for the report on the call for a return
							of State debts— I met <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M’Clintock
								Young</persRef> in the entry on the lower floor, who told me that
							the report had been sent to the house— I went immediately to the Capitol
							for a day of business so diversified multiplied and important that I can
							make no record of it. My call on the <persRef ref="upshur-abel"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> for returns of native Seamen by
							States, had been left last Evening under the previous question, and a
							forced adjournment for want of a Quorum— But there were five or six
							other fragments of unfinished business to be taken up in turn— And I had
							last week given notice that I should move this day to go into Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union to take up the French claim bill—
							I got the floor by moving an amendment of the Journal, which was clear
							and made without opposition; and while up, referring to my notice given
							I moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union to
							take up my french claim bill: but I had numerous competitors for the
							floor— <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> consumed an hour and a half, to
							bully and browbeat the house to rescind the record of Cooper’s disgrace
							on the journal— <persRef ref="hall-hiland">Hiland Hall</persRef> took
							the morning hour to flay <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W.
								Gilmer</persRef> on the Virginia Military Land Warrants— The
							struggle for the floor was continued through a great part of the day:
							Several bills at their third reading were passed without opposition— Two
							reports from the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, were <pb n="185" type="ms"/>presented by the
								<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>—one of them the answer
							to the call of the house of last Summer for a return of the State debts,
							which at my motion was ordered to be laid on the table and printed— By
							dint of importunities I obtained the adoption of my resolution offered
							yesterday, calling on the Secretary of the Navy for returns of native
							and naturalized Seamen by States—to which <persRef ref="johnson-cave"
								>Cave John</persRef> succeeded in adding an amendment concerning the
							cost of Ships. <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Filmore</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the rules to take up the amendments of the Senate to the
							temporary tariff—he failed by a vote of 127 to 66. not quite two thirds.
							The bill was nevertheless soon after taken up—the previous question
							called and carried on the amendments of the Senate, containing the
							suspension of the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands to
							the States, from the first of July to the first of August—this surrender
							of all the proceeds of the public lands, and was perpetrated by a whig
							vote of 104 to 96. <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne’s</persRef> motion
							to reconsider the vote rejecting the bill for the relief of <persRef
								ref="stewart-hugh">Hugh Stewart</persRef> was carried 95 to 43. and
							the bill was passed 87 to 69. I voted for the reconsideration and for
							the bill upon explanation made to me this morning by <persRef
								ref="nye-jw">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nye</persRef>. I moved
							so often to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							that I finally succeeded by tellers 62 to 60.— <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy</persRef> had the floor on his report and
							bill from the Committee of Commerce; but yielded it to me, and I moved
							to take up the French claim bill. Carried by Tellers 72 to 70. <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H Lewis</persRef> instantly moved the
							committee to rise—lost by tellers 66 to 79— At last the <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef> read the bill through; and I
							then made an exposition of claim, and had read by the Clerk <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">B. Howard’s</persRef> report as Chairman of
							the Committee of Foreign Affairs in March 1838. I moved the Committee to
							rise and report the Bill—but <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> made a heated speech against the Bill, <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> a short one in its
							favour and <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef> moved the
							Committee to rise, for the chance of another day to pour out his volley
							against it and the Committee rose. <persRef ref="tyler-john3">John Tyler
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> delivered to the

								United States</persRef> announcing to the house that he had approved
							and signed the apportionment bill; and had sent with the Bill to the
							Department of State, his reasons for signing it— I moved that the
							message be referred to a select Committee with power to send for persons
							and papers— I gave my reasons for this motion which were answered with
							great violence by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>. Adjourned
							after 5. O’Clock— Walk and heard the music in the President’s grounds—
							Evening visit from <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant Hudson</persRef>.</p>

						<p>I went alone this morning, to public worship at the hall of the house of
							Representatives. <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tustin</persRef> preached from Luke 23.43. “And Jesus
							said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day, though shalt be with me,
							in paradise.” There are various points of view under which this text may
							be and has been considered. One of them upon the dangers of death bed
							repentance; upon which I twice heard a discourse of great power from the
							late <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">D, M’Cormick</persRef> which I
							always suspected to be of other than his composition— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin dwelt upon the exemplification in
							this instance of the unbounded power of repentance; he marked the
							apparent difference between the narratives of <persRef ref="matthew"
								>Matthew</persRef> which charges both the malefactors with reviling
							Jesus and <persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef> which represents one of
							them as penitent, and thereby securing the instantaneous and free pardon
							of all his sins.— He supposes to reconcile the two Stories together that
							the repentance was instantaneous, and after the nailing of the
							malefactors to their crosses— In the course of the services M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin alluded to the unusual number of
							deaths among the members of the present Congress, and distinctly
							intimated that there was now another added to the list. <persRef
								ref="parmenter-william">William Parmenter</persRef> who sat in the
							seat behind me informed me after the services were over, that the
							deceased was our colleague <persRef ref="hastings-william">William Soden
								Hastings</persRef> of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							congressional district— He died on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> at the red Sulphur Springs in
							Virginia. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parmenter mentioned and
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> confirmed that it was
							proposed to hold a meeting of the Massachusetts delegation at the
							Committee room of the Committee of the House on Post-Offices and Post
							roads at 9 O’Clock tomorrow morning; which I promised to attend. After
							church I called at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> hotel
							and enquired whither <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence</persRef> was gone?
							they told me to <persRef ref="turnbull-william">Major
								Turnbull’s</persRef>— Thither I went, and there I found him— He has
							been unwell, but is now better— He gave me a general idea of the state
							of the negotiation, which is not very promising. But he says he has had
							confidential conversations with <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Lord
								Ashburton</persRef>; and finds him fair and candid— After dinner at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity, and a stranger preached from Luke 16.25. [“]But <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> said, Son, remember that thou in thy
							life-time received it thy good things, and likewise <persRef
								ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> evil things: but now he is comforted
							and thou art tormented.” A sensible well written and judicious discourse
							upon the parable of Lazarus.— After church I called at <persRef

								ref="palmer-john5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horsley
								Palmer</persRef> who had brought me a Letter from <persRef

							late President of the Senate; he died yesterday morning at

							and that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard in the Senate, this
							day; but that the latter should not be communicated to the house till

							Hastings, a member of the house from the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congressional district of Massachusetts; and after a short
							address to the house upon his character I moved the usual Resolutions,
							of the deep sensibility of the house at the decease of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hastings, and that the members will wear
							crape 30 days, which were unanimously adopted— Also, that the <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> inform the <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">Governor of Massachusetts</persRef> of the vacancy
							in the delegation from that State; and then that the house do adjourn. I

						<p>Woes cluster— Rare are solitary woes. The melancholy duties of the last

							character— The thermometer is up to 90, and I can scarcely move one foot
							before another.— At the house after the usual number of creeping in
							resolutions about Post roads and land claims <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> offered three resolutions of
							enquiry about dismissed officers <unclear>han</unclear>ding over public monies which were
							adopted— I called up my resolution for the appointment of a select
							committee upon the masked veto message— I had some difficulty in getting
							it up; and foreseeing, that my right to speak to it a second time, I
							offered a modification of it, that the Committee should consist of five
							members— <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W. Andrews</persRef> who
							had the floor yielded it to me— Objection was made to my speaking a
							second time, but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said
							that the resolution having been modified since I spoke, it was no longer
							to the same question.— So indispensable is small management in this
							great assembly. But for this little artifice I should surely have been
							silenced— I spoke a full hour, and brought out all my objections to the
							masked veto— When I finished Landaff W. Andrews moved the previous
							question— Seconded 75 to 72. Proffit moved the yeas and nays on the
							question, shall the main question be now put—Yeas and nays 107 to 97.
								<persRef ref="boyd-linn">Boyd</persRef> moved to lay the whole

							the resolution by striking out the power to send for persons and papers;
							but this was objected to: I therefore required and <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> moved to divide the question.— The
							reference was carried without division, and the power to send for person
							and papers was rejected.— The Indian appropriation bill was then taken
							up— M’Kay made a feeble demonstration of enormous abuses and <persRef
								ref="gwin-william">Gwinn</persRef> moved a new section but the
							previous question swept off all else, and the bill was passed. <persRef

						<p>At the house this morning, <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> offered a Resolution of enquiry of the <persRef
								ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, whether he
							has changed his opinion since he reported to the house that it might
							well be doubted whether without further legislation by Congress, any
							impost duties can be collected after this day; and if so what has caused
							the change. Adopted without opposition. <persRef ref="mckeon-john">John
								M’Keon</persRef> came to my seat with a Resolution which he was
							about to offer directing the Committee of Naval Affairs to enquire into
							the expediency of testifying in some manner the high sense entertained
							by this house of the merits and services of the officers and men
							employed in the late exploring expedition— I advised him to insert the
							name of <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieutenant Charles
								Wilkes</persRef> the commander, which he did. But <persRef
								ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> of Norfolk objected to the
							Resolution as untimely— He was for waiting to know what had been the
							results of the expedition— Ay—said M’Keon— Wilkes is not a Virginian—
							M’Keon’s resolution was not received. <persRef ref="weller-john">John P.
								Weller</persRef>, the rankest 5 points democrat in the house
							volunteered to be the new <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef>
							financier, and first asked the unanimous consent of the house, and then
							moved a suspension of the rules, and called for the yeas and nays to
							enable him to introduce a bill, to be carried through both houses of
							Congress and signed by the President this day, to continue all the
							tariff Laws, as they existed on the first of this month, until further
							Legislation by Congress— <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>
							moved a Call of the house— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> called the yeas and nays on this motion and they
							were taken 89 to 80— The house was called—202 members answered to their
							names. Weller modified his bill, limiting it to the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of next March instead of till further
							legislation by Congress and adding to existing laws the words in actual
							operation— <persRef ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> moved to
							lay Weller’s motion to suspend the rules, <unclear>on</unclear> the table but at <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Everett’s</persRef> request withdrew his
							motion— The vote by yeas and nays to suspend the rules was 96 to 106.
							not even a majority— <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef>
							immediately moved again to suspend the rules to enable him to introduce
							a bill, authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe
							regulations for the appraisement of imported goods, ad libitum under the
							direction of the President— Yeas and nays on Roosevelt’s motion to
							suspend the Rules 91 to 113.— Then the debate on the little tariff veto
							was resumed. <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="stuart-alexander2">A. H. H. Stuart</persRef> <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, <persRef ref="lane-henry">Lane</persRef> of Indiana and Weller kept it up till 5. O’Clock.
							<persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef> took the floor. Committee rose—and house adjourned. We had a
							numerous party of evening visitors as per margin— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> has been
							these last two days down to 90.— I saw in the house this day <persRef ref="southard-isaac">Isaac
							Southard</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>.</p>
