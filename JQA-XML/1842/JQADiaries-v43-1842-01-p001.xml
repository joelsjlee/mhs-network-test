						<dateline>Washington. Saturday 1. January 1842</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV. </date>Saturday</p>
						<list><item>500 Visitors</item></list>
						<p>This was the thirtieth New-Year’s day that in the course of my life, I
							have passed at the city of Washington; and the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							in succession; and of the physical atmosphere was without exception the
							finest of those days. One of the consequences of which was that the
							President’s house was thronged with visitors beyond all former example.
							So thronged as we heard from many of those who went there, that the
							crowd in the house was so great that to avert the danger of suffocation,
							the porter at the outer door was obliged to lock out hundreds who were
							rushing to it for admission; and that among the excluded were both the
							<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General’s Scott</persRef> and <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef>.— I say visitors to the house, for it is the
							house, and not the President who is visited— From the first
							establishment of the Government of the United States to this day, there
							never has been a time, when the personal sympathies of the people of all
							parties were so utterly indifferent as they are this day to <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef>—
							<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">Our</persRef> own visitors this day were not less than 500. more than double the
							number we have ever had before— Great numbers of members of Congress,
							with their wives and children; but scarcely one of them other than of
							the whig party— Generals Scott and Gaines were here at the same time—the
							latter with <persRef ref="gaines-myra">his wife</persRef>— And he said to me that he came to see the only
							President of the United States that he ever saw— I said that was too
							much—and a compliment that I could not accept— He said there had been,
							other, Presidents of the United States—two or three—but he had never
							seen either of them— The rest had all been Presidents not of the United
							States; but of a party— Gaines is sore, at the appointment of Scott as
							the Major General.— <persRef ref="parker-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Parker</persRef> wife of the <persRef ref="parker-peter">Chinese
							Doctor</persRef> was here, and told me that her husband concurred perfectly with
							me in all the opinions of my lecture on the Chinese war— Among our
							visitors was a grandson of <persRef ref="lee-richard2">Richard Henry Lee</persRef> a Lieutenant, and a purser,
							a classmate of my old friend and classmate <persRef ref="bridge-james">James Bridge</persRef> now deceased—
							When the stream of visitors ceased, I went and visited <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Madison</persRef>— Called at <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ogle Tayloe’s</persRef>,
							and left cards for <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tayloe</persRef> and her mother <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickinson</persRef>. At seven O’clock we all went and spent
							the Evening at <persRef ref="hellen-adelaide">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hellen’s</persRef>. Party at whist with
							<persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi

						<list><item>Adams Joseph Harrod</item></list>
						<p>When I rose this morning there was a large circle round the moon,
							portending foul weather, but not followed this day by its usual
							consequences. At the second presbyterian church, <persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clark</persRef> preached from Job 30.23. [“]For I know that thou wilt bring me to
							death, and to the house appointed for all living.”— A discourse upon
							Death; always appropriate—specially suited to the commencement of the
							year, and at every return of the day more impressive to all who like me
							have long passed through the turnpike gate of three score and ten, and
							am already coming to the half way stile, between that and four-score— It
							is one of the imperfections of my nature that I do not realize as I
							ought the certain approach of death by a diligent and faithful
							improvement of the still diminishing sands of the glass. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clark’s address to the aged part of his auditory was earnest
							and solemn—but how often have I said to myself all and more than all
							that he said to me— The spirit is willing; but the flesh is weak— Oh!
							how weak! how impotent! M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark gave notice that
							divine service would continue to be regularly performed in this church
							three times every Sunday, and announced Lectures and prayer meetings,
							for almost every day of the coming week. My nephew, the passed
							midshipman <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod Adams</persRef> dined with us. At S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the evening service
							for the second Sunday after Christmas, with the collect for the day of
							the Circumcision.— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Humphreys</persRef> of Annapolis
							preached from 2. Kings 8.12 [“]And Hazael said, why weepeth my lord? And
							he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children
							of Israel.”— He omitted the specifications in the remainder of the
							verse, and began by remarking how painful the office of the hebrew
							prophets must have been. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys is an elderly
							man—grave, sensible, cold—of the old English, episcopal school— No
							northern mail this evening, and of course no letter from Boston— I am
							drawing to a close of reading <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Trumbull’s</persRef>
							autobiography, and am diverted by a sudden patriotic and cosmopolitan
							impulse, which seized him in the Spring of 1799, to spur up the United
							States, to plunge into War, to emancipate the Spanish American Colonies.
							This was the <persRef ref="miranda-francisco">Miranda</persRef> project, though the Colonel neither names nor
							alludes to him— <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef> answer was a damper, and should have made
							the umpire commissioner, and revolutionary painter, somewhat distrustful
							of his third capacity of a far seeing Statesman, and volunteer
							liberator.</p>

						<list><item>Jagger William</item></list>
						<p>The Northern Mail did not arrive at its usual time last Evening and we
							received no letter from Boston; but it came this morning with a letter
							from <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>, dated Friday, the last day of the year, and full of
							cheering hope, that <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> child <persRef ref="adams-henry4">Henry</persRef>, is convalescent; and may yet
							by the mercy of God be spared— One Calendar month has expired since he
							was seized with the scarlet fever, only five days after I with his
							father had left him in full health; one of the charmingest children that
							ever breathed the air of heaven— Oh! may divine providence preserve him
							for long and useful life.— At the house <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> came out
							with a hard studied, Southern whig, jesuitical, slave-breeder speech of
							an hour and a half, for the reference of the tariff question to the
							Committee of Ways and Means— The completest specimen of his trickish
							propensities that I had ever heard— Almost all his talent consists of
							trickery— This time his cunning device was discomfited. As soon as he
							finished <persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef>, moved the previous question, after a short
							preamble; and after withdrawing it for a few minutes to allow <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
							Williams</persRef> to give in brief his reasons for voting for it.— the question
							of seconding the call was after a call of the house, carried by tellers
							88 to 88, decided by the casting vote of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>— On the question
							shall the main question be now put the vote by yeas and nays was 101 to
							97. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved to adjourn, but on a call for the yeas and nays
							withdrew the motion. <persRef ref="wood-fernando">Fernando Wood</persRef> of New-York moved to adjourn, and
							after eight or ten all nays were called was permitted by general consent
							to withdraw his motion—a crafty modification of <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore’s</persRef> motion of
							reference to the committee of manufactures moved by <persRef ref="mason-samson">Samson Mason</persRef>, was
							accepted by Fillmore— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> withdrew his proposed amendment— The yeas
							and nays on <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton’s</persRef> amendment to strike out the manufactures and
							insert the ways and means, were 95 to 104. the loco-foco democracy of
							the North and west voting with the Slave breeding South, but the whole
							vote of Pennsylvania without exception being for the manufactures.— The
							Report from the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, in answer to <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing’s</persRef> call
							relating to the Coast survey was then communicated by the Speaker to the
							house. I moved the printing of the same number of extra copies for <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler</persRef> as were given him on a former occasion,
							but Cushing and Cave Johnson cavilled off the question till to-morrow.
							Motions to adjourn— I intreated the house to pass the residue of
							Fillmore’s Resolutions, distributing the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message among the
							Committees which they did; and one additional moved by <persRef ref="cooper-james2">Cooper</persRef>, of the
							Indian Affairs. It was 3. O’Clock, but Clio had stopped at two. <persRef ref="jagger-william">William
							Jagger</persRef> was here this Evening.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. Present Adams, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef>, <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef>, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W.

							<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>, who had given notice that he would call up for consideration so
							much of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">Presidents</persRef> message as relates to the claim of the British
							Government to the right of searching American vessels on the coast of
							Africa— He has probably been better advised since the last meeting of
							the Committee— Cushing was instructed to report to the house two bills,
							reciprocating the suspension of discriminating tonnage duties on certain
							Spanish vessels, and on vessels from Cayenne— I presented for
							consideration the Message of 19. July 1841. and the Letter and Documents
							from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>, urging the re-enactment of the Law of 10.
							March 1838. to secure the peace of the Canada frontier— I mentioned the
							interview I had had with the Secretary of State on the subject; and the
							earnest wish expressed by him, and felt, as he assured me, by the
							President for the revival of the act— But there was a repugnance
							apparently unanimous in the Committee, against it.— After full
							discussion it was postponed.— In the house, the question of reference to
							a select committee of the petitions and remonstrances against the
							gag-rule, came up, but, by the shameless prevarications of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>
							and of about twenty members of the northern democracy, it was laid on
							the table, which on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December had been
							refused by yeas and nays 87 to 92.— The baseness of these proceedings is
							too severe a trial of my temper— Oh! for restraining grace—for
							inflexible firmness—for untiring perseverance—for suavity of manner, and
							for self-controul.— The first vote now was declared 115 to 84 for laying
							on the table— I insisted on the taking the question upon each separate
							petition The second vote to lay on the table was 103 to 87. <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef>
							did not vote— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> moved that according to the rule he should be
							compelled to vote, and put him to shame— The Speaker said the rule
							required him to vote; but Stanly said he would not press the matter, and
							he did not vote—but Stanly called the yeas and nays again on the next
							petition, and Roosevelt then voted in the affirmative, the vote then was
							107 to 83.— The question was then taken separately but without yeas and
							nays upon five or six other petitions, when <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> started up, and moved
							a reconsideration of the vote yesterday to refer the tariff part of the
							message to the committee on manufactures, and began a speech against
							<persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> of New-Hampshire He was soon called to order; and a most
							disorderly debate on order, ensued, cut short only by a motion of <persRef ref="barton-richard">Barton</persRef>
							of Virginia to adjourn which was carried. Walking home I met <persRef ref="rives-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rives</persRef> the Senator from Virginia, and Chairman of
							the Senates Committee of foreign Affairs, who walked home with me.</p>

						<item>Jagger William</item></list>
						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="ruggles-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles</persRef>, one of the Canal
							Commissioners of the State of New-York. He comes here now, in connection
							with a plan, concerning which I received some time since, a Letter from
							<persRef ref="seward-william">Governor Seward</persRef> by which the general Government, may relieve the States
							from the burden of their debts incurred by undertakings of internal
							improvement, by purchasing a perpetual right of free passage over all
							the railroads in the United States for the mail, and for military
							purposes.— Long and free conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ruggles, disclosing my apprehensions<hi rend="superscript"> </hi>that this
							measure cannot be carried through as of any efficiency to relieve the
							States, and that no measure devised by the present Administration will
							restore the level of exchanges, the stability of the currency or the
							sufficiency of the revenue for the expenditures— I said that increased
							taxation by impost; the assumption of the State debts, and a National
							Bank on the old platform, were the three measures indispensable for the
							payment of the public debt, the restoration of public credit, and the
							punctual payment of the expenses of the Government— Neither of these
							measures will be adopted by the general Government, and the present
							<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> is following the path of his <persRef ref="jackson-andrew;vanburen-martin">two immediate predecessors</persRef>
							downward to universal bankruptcy— At the house, after the reading of the
							Journal I moved that it should be amended by striking out the
							instructions which I had proposed on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							December to give to the select committee which I then moved to raise,
							but which instructions the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> had then decided to be not in order,
							and I had withdrawn them— This motion raised a debate of an hour and a
							half in which I proved beyond all question the falsification of the
							Journal and the prevarications of the Speaker; but <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> finally
							moved to lay my motion to amend the Journal on the table and carried it
							by yeas and nays 99 to 78.— Then came up <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne’s</persRef> appeal from the
							Speaker’s decision allowing <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> to speak in violation of the rules,
							in reply to <persRef ref="burke-edmund4">Burke</persRef> and <persRef ref="eastman-ira">Eastman</persRef>. After much debate, the yeas and nays
							being called I rose at the call of my name and was assigning my reasons
							for not sustaining the decision of the Speaker, when he called me to
							order; the appeal not being debatable; thoughe had in the hurry of
							yesterday decided otherwise— I voted against his decision which was
							reversed 67 to 89. Arnold said to me, Et tu Brute! and after some
							struggling withdrew his motion for reconsideration, and the house
							adjourned. <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J. Frye</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— Evening visits from <persRef ref="mccurdy-dennis">Dennis
							M’Curdy</persRef> and <persRef ref="jagger-william">William Jagger</persRef>. Encouraging Letter from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="espy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Espy</persRef> the storm-breeder, who had notified me at
							Boston, that he would be here at the beginning of the year, punctual to
							his time appeared yesterday at the house and requested me to fix a time
							for an interview. I appointed 9 O’Clock this morning.— He left with me a
							paper, exposing his three wishes of appropriations by Congress for his
							benefit, about as rational as those of <persRef ref="hanscarvel">Hans Carvel</persRef> and <persRef ref="hanscarvelswife">his wife</persRef>— The man
							is methodically Monomaniac, and the dimension of his organ of
							self-esteem have been swollen to the size of a goitre, by a report from
							a committee of the National Institute of France endorsing all his
							crackbrained discoveries in meteorology. I told him with all possible
							civility that it would be of no use to memorialize the house of
							Representatives in behalf of his three wishes. He said he had thoughts
							of addressing the Senate, and asked if they should pass a bill in his
							favour whether I would support it in the House— I said if the Senate
							should pass such a bill, I would do all that I could for him in the
							house— There was an attempt in the house this morning to introduce
							petitions, but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> declared the 30 days expired; a motion was
							made to suspend the rules, by <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Dean</persRef> of Ohio, for him to present a
							petition, modified at the request of <persRef ref="goggin-william">Goggin</persRef>, for the reception of
							Petitions generally—the motion just failed 100 to 52. The Committees
							were called for Reports. <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> from the Committee of Manufactures
							requested a Resolution to authorize that Committee to take testimony
							respecting the tariff and its operation upon the interests of the
							Country— This started at once the tariff question with all its
							inflammatory matter— It was debated an hour and a half, till <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							called for the orders of the day; that is the Bill to authorize the
							issuing of Treasury Notes, which started again in substance the same
							debate— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved an amendment to repeal the distributing Sections of
							the last Session’s land Bill— M’Keon had given notice yesterday that he
							should move that same thing, and now claimed his thunder, but Wise would
							not yield it— He made a second furious anti protective speech— Fillmore
							implored Wise to withdraw his amendment but he refused— The debate soon
							became entangled and <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> moved the Committee to rise; which was
							carried 83 to 64— The report from the State Department to the call for
							the census aggregates was received, and referred to the apportionment
							committee, to determine, whether it shall be printed— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Weems</persRef> was here this Evening and read to me a Letter to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

						<p><persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef> called on me this morning. he has

							dead of winter to use his influence and bespeak mine to save his friend
							<persRef ref="u">Hart</persRef> from being turned out of the office of the naval constructor at the

							were now suspended; and he must begin the call at the Territory of Iowa
							and proceed northward— When it came to the turn of Ohio Giddings
							presented a succession of petitions, upon which <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and W. Cost
							Johnson, and <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina, raised the question of
							reception, and then moved to lay the question of reception on the table,
							and when they could not make the question of reception they moved to lay
							the petition on the table; and in every case the motion to lay on the
							table was carried the Northern democracy dropping in one by one into the
							ranks of the slave-breeders.— <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> and <persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> of New-York were thus
							whipped in this day, as <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> had been by <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> two days ago.— Upon
							one of the questions, started by Campbell, a question upon the reception
							of a petition which the Speaker had decided to be receivable, and then a
							motion to lay on the table his own question of reception, I refused to
							vote; and after Bowne and Gordon had been disciplined Wise called on the
							Speaker to apply the same screw to me— The Speaker did not hear him.
							<persRef ref="mathiot-joshua">Mathiot</persRef> repeated the demand— Stanly moved to postpone that question to
							the first Monday in December—for they had tried me upon that question
							before, and they would get nothing by trying it again— So the call for
							petitions proceeded till they came to Kentucky, when on a petition for
							the repeal of the bankrupt law, debate lowered and the house
							adjourned—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef> the new Minister of the second Presbyterian
							church called on me again this morning to repeat the invitation to me to
							deliver a lecture of the course commenced for the benefit to that
							Church, and which is to be continued weekly through the winter— I
							declined, as I had done before, and have been compelled to do in many
							other cases— At the house the suspension of the rules, for the purpose
							of receiving petitions for the whole day was occupied in prescribing the
							bankrupt law’s repeal. <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> had yesterday presented a petition
							from Kentucky for its repeal, and <persRef ref="cravens-james">Cravens</persRef> of Indiana had moved its
							reference to the Committee on the judiciary, with instructions to report
							a repealing bill— This was somewhat startling, and brought up a snarl,
							in the midst of which the house adjourned— This day various expedients
							were tried to get rid of the instructions, but in vain. The yeas and
							nays were taken, times without number; beside a call of the house, which
							consumed an hour—all would not avail— The reference with the
							instructions was carried<space/>Immediately after which <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef>
							presented a petition from Louisville, which he said was nine feet long,
							and moved its reference to the judiciary Committee with instructions to
							report the repealing act, forthwith— This word was peculiarly obnoxious
							to the whigs because it was used in the instructions to the Committee of
							Elections in the last Congress to report on the New-Jersey case— In
							courtesy to this whig scruple, Marshall drop’d his word forthwith, first
							for Monday and then for Tuesday next—which was carried— The whole of
							this process was accomplished by the coalition of <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> and mock
							democracy votes— And is the first symptom of a new party combination
							against Northern interests— Its first object is the prostration, ruin
							and dismissal of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>— As soon as the vote was completed, <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> of
							Tennessee moved a reconsideration, to prevent its being made by any one
							else, and the repeal of the bankrupt act was clenched— <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of

						<p><persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer</persRef> went with me this morning to the second
							presbyterian church, where <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> preached from
							John 1.11. [“]He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12.
							But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of
							God, even to them that believe on his name: 13. Which were born, not of
							blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
							God.”— These words explicitly indicate the spiritual character of that
							regeneration, which Jesus had declared to Nicodemus was indispensable
							for entrance into the kingdom of God— This doctrine of regeneration with
							its inseparable attendant the atonement seem to form the sum total of
							Calvinistic preaching.— It suited— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer, one of
							whose glories is that there are in Braintree three churches, all
							orthodox and no more— He thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore’s Sermon
							sensible, and judicious, and guessed he was a clever man— The usual
							notices were given of three services at the church every Sunday, and
							daily lectures during the week; one of which weekly, is upon <persRef ref="bunyan-john">Bunyan’s</persRef>
							Pilgrim’s Progress. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer came again at 3.
							O’Clock, and went with me to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church,
							where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the evening service for the
							first Sunday after the epiphany, and preached from Genesis 28.15. “And
							behold,— I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou
							goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave
							thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer liked the discourse of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley very well, and thought him a solid man— He thought
							also that <persRef ref="wolcott-calvin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott</persRef>, the Minister of the episcopal
							church at Quincy was a smart man. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer wanted
							also to call on the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, to interpose in behalf of a poor
							woman at Braintree, whose husband is in trouble for desertion from the
							army; and he intimated a wish that I would give him a Letter of
							introduction to the Secretary of War— Without refusing, I did not comply
							with this request, humane and benevolent as it was—believing that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer would not be gratified or edified by
							officious interference to screen from punishment a deserter, because it
							is afflictive to his wife. <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>, and her

						<p>My catarrhal cough returned yesterday, and for what am I good for the
							rest of the winter? At the entrance of the Representative hall, I met
							<persRef ref="jagger-william">William Jagger</persRef>, who said he wanted dreadfully to have a talk with me;
							and I told him to come to my house at 7. O’Clock this Evening. The
							<persRef ref="maffitt-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> John Nowland Maffit</persRef> an Irish Methodist,
							celebrated and notorious made this morning in the house the shortest
							prayer that I ever heard in public— He arrived here last Saturday
							Evening from Boston where a Society has been formed, and engaged him to
							preach to them for five years— He preached yesterday in the Hall of the
							House. This was by the rules the second bi-weekly day for the
							presentation of Resolutions—but the rules have been four days suspended
							for the reception of Petitions— This was the unfinished business of this
							morning; but <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillmore</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee
							of Ways and Means, with grievous lamentations over the bankruptcy and
							beggary of the Treasury, moved again to suspend the rules, to go into
							Committee of the whole upon the state of the Union, to take up the bill
							to authorize the issue of Treasury Notes; and this motion was carried by
							yeas and nays,<space/>Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the Chair— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> withdrew the amendment that he had offered of
							a second section repealing the distribution of the proceeds of the sales
							of the public lands— But it was then moved by <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> of Ohio.—The
							Chairman decided that it was not in order, and Weller appealed—after a
							debate of an hour or more the question was taken by Tellers and the
							chairman’s decision was sustained. <persRef ref="cooper-james2">Cooper</persRef> of Pennsylvania then opened a
							battery against the bill itself, the issue of treasury notes.— He poured
							down a shower of sarcasms upon <persRef ref="tyler-john">Tyler’s</persRef> courtship of the damsel
							loco-focoism—which brought up Wise in passionate flat contradiction, and
							<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> in a foolish rhodomontade of Tyler’s appeal to the people— Poor
							Proffit was crucified by <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> who last week took the
							temperance pledge, and this day, perfectly sober made the most splendid
							and powerful speech of the Session. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> then took the floor—the
							Committee rose and the house adjourned— I notified the members of the
							Committee on the Smithsonian bequest, to meet Wednesday morning— At 7
							O’Clock this evening Jagger came and spent the evening with me in
							enquiries historical.</p>

							to report the same to the house.— I communicated the Letter and

							to the search by British Cruizers of American Merchant vessels on the

							said that having offered the Resolution, he declined voting upon it— If
							he had voted for it, and I had voted against it, he would still have
							failed— I voted for it; willing to indulge him although perceiving the
							insidious object of enquiry, and trusting quite as much as they deserved
							his professions of not wishing to interfere with the negotiations of the
							Executive— I hold it just and politic to leave the initiative of debate
							in the house on this subject to the Slave holders— There was some
							conversation upon the report prepared by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett
							on the claim of <persRef ref="meade-margaret">Margaret Meade</persRef>, which he had lent me, and I had read— I
							did not concur in its conclusions, and noticed parts of the report, from

							decision— At the House after a claim by <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef>, of
							preference for the order to the Committee on the judiciary to report
							this day a bill to repeal the bankrupt act; and some confused discussion
							the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> decided against it— That the first order of the day was to
							receive Petitions. Marshall appealed, and called the previous question
							the decision of the Speaker was sustained by yeas and nays 117 to 84.
							Then <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules to take up the Treasury

							<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> made his speech, and offered his amendment— <persRef ref="gamble-roger">Gamble</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> made speeches in favour of the Bill, and <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Dean</persRef> of Ohio, a
							furious one against it, and against the whig party so ludicrous that he
							went on for at least an hour amid continual shouts of laughter— <persRef ref="floyd-john3">John G.
							Floyd</persRef> followed on the same side, but after several abortive motions to

							<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules, to offer a Resolution to take
							the Treasury Note Bill out of Committee at 2 to-morrow afternoon—much

							yesterday against the Bill, or rather against the whig party—he said he

							hours without check, controul or interruption A general retaliation upon
							all the modern democracy for all their ribaldry against the whigs; but
							his declamation was intermingled with much lofty sentiment and much

						<p>I called this morning at the Department of State, with a Letter
							communicating to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">him</persRef> the resolution of the Committee, direction their

							have occurred since the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> annual message relating to the
							search by British Cruizers of American vessels on the Coast of Africa—
							He read the Letter and said nothing— I enquired whether the report on
							the call of the house last winter, for documents concerning our
							relations with the Republic of Hayti, was to be expected soon. He said
							it was in a course of preparation— I told him I should probably move a
							call for <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Stevenson’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef>, and also on the Navy
							department, for the proceedings of the Court of enquiry and Court
							Martial for the recent trial of <persRef ref="bolton-william">Captain Bolton</persRef>. He said nothing— I
							observed that the state of our affairs generally seemed unpleasant and
							that there was every prospect of the bankrupt law—he made no reply— I
							said difficulties seemed to multiply upon us— Yes! said he—difficulties
							on all sides— He was evidently absorbed in deep agitation of mind— <persRef ref="forward-walter">M<hi

							at this moment with <persRef ref="raymond-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Raymond</persRef>, and I left

							<persRef ref="bliss-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Bliss</persRef> and <persRef ref="walley-samuel">Samuel H. Walley</persRef>— There were
							several persons with him, among the rest a young man named <persRef ref="u">Lyman</persRef>, who
							announced himself to me, as the agent of the New-York and Erie rail-road
							company, who had come to contract for carrying the mail on that road,
							which he said would be finished in the course of the present year. M<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bliss had written to me. M<hi rend="superscript"

							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union on the Treasury
							note-bill <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> in the chair— The <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles;ingersoll-joseph">two brothers Ingersoll</persRef> made long

							last reported with two or three Amendments to the house, and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>

						<p>I called this morning at the Department of the Treasury, and requested of
							the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary</persRef> a statement of the present condition of the Smithsonian
							fund, and copies of the State Bonds in which it has been invested for
							the information of the Committee to which the subject has been referred
							by the house— I enquired also when the report upon the debts of the
							States called for by Resolution of the house, might be expected.— He
							said he had written to the Governors of the several States, and had
							received answers from some, and not from others— The answers from the
							heaviest States were received. And he directed the chief <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">Clerk
							M’Clintock Young</persRef> to write again to write to the States whence there are
							as yet no answers— At the house the previous question had been moved
							last Night by <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> upon the Treasury Note Bill— It was now seconded
							and taken— The amendments moved by Arnold, Everett and Underwood were
							rejected— That moved by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T. W. Gilmer</persRef> was carried by yeas and nays 105 to
							102— The Bill was then passed without yeas and nays, to the third
							reading—whereupon <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef>, enquired of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> whether
							the previous question of the passage to the third reading was not spent—
							The Speaker said it was— Upon which Saunders moved to recommit the Bill,
							with instructions to report a suspension of the land distribution bill,
							and the application of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to
							the redemption of the Treasury Note Bills.— Fillmore moved the previous
							question which cut off Saunders’s motion, and it was carried. The bill
							was then passed by yeas and nays 129 to 86. with the party vote on both
							sides, splintered as I have seen an Oak of the forest by a thunder-bolt.
							<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> chairman of the Committee of claims, now intreated the house to
							take up private business, according to the rules, but the house adhered
							to the suspension of the rules and the call of the States for the
							reception of Petitions, arrested at Kentucky.— <persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">Pendleton</persRef> of Ohio,
							requested permission out of his turn to present two remonstrances from
							Cincinnati against the repeal of the bankrupt law— I claimed the same
							privilege as did several other members without success— Giddings’s
							motion to postpone the reception of petitions, and take up private
							business was rejected by yeas and nays 89 to 117— On the call for
							Petitions <persRef ref="thompson-john2">John B. Thompson</persRef>, presented sundry Resolutions of the
							Legislature of Kentucky, quite belligerent against Mexico, concerning a
							recent expedition from Texas to Santa-Fe, which has fallen into the
							hands <pb n="15" type="ms"/>of the Mexicans, and been somewhat roughly
							treated— In this expedition a <persRef ref="combs-franklin">son</persRef> of <persRef ref="combs-leslie">Leslie Coombs</persRef> of Kentucky, a mere
							youth of seventeen, was an adventurer and the Resolutions of the
							Legislature of Kentucky declare that protection is due to all, and every
							the humblest citizen of the republic whether at home or abroad— There
							are four Resolutions with a preamble all of the same stamp— Thompson
							moved their reference to the Committee of foreign relations, and that
							they be printed which was ordered— Then <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> offered the
							same set of Resolutions, and moved their reference to the Committee of
							Foreign Relations with instructions to collect and report to the house
							information respecting this Texian expedition to Santa Fe— <persRef ref="wood-fernando">Fernando Wood</persRef>
							of New-York moved to add the same instructions to the Committee
							respecting the American Prisoners in Van Diemen’s land.— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>
							suggested that the information should be obtained, not by instructions
							to the Committee, but by a call upon the Executive— Marshall modified
							his resolution accordingly and Wood his amendment, and they were
							adopted— <persRef ref="linn-archibald">Linn</persRef> of Schenectady New-York having declared his intention to
							debate the question about the Van Diemens land prisoners, but finally
							withdrawing his objection— The Speaker presented a petition from
							Richmond County Kentucky— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved its reference to the judiciary
							Committee, with instructions to report a Bill to amend the Bankrupt Act
							of the last Session, by including money-corporations within its
							provisions. long debate and puzzle whether these instructions would
							interfere with those already given to the Committee to report a bill of
							repeal— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moves to lay the petition, reference and
							instructions all on the table; and after some time spent in wriggling
							round the question as usual in such cases it was taken by yeas and nays
							and by a vote of 100 to 101. decided not to be laid upon the table— The
							question came back upon Briggs’s motion of reference with instructions
							which Briggs modified at the request of <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of Maine, who after
							thus taking him in voted against his resolution— <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> moved an
							adjournment, at half past 3 which was carried, by yeas and nays 101 to
							88. I walked home and stop’d on my way at <persRef ref="montandon-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Montandon’s</persRef> and left with him again my Chronometer to be regulated—
							<persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> spent the Evening here</p>

						<p><persRef ref="baldwin-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> was here this morning and left with me a

							and to <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Joshua Giddings</persRef> of Jefferson Ashtabula County Ohio, to hold with

							of Anson Maine <persRef ref="calhoun-william">William B. Calhoun</persRef> of Springfield, Massachusetts, <persRef ref="slade-william">William

							restore to the people the right of petition now smothered in both houses

							Committee on the judiciary a Bill to repeal the Bankrupt Act of the last

							with the compromise of 1833— The Bill was read—and the democracy were

						<p>With <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Adams</persRef>, I attended public
							worship this morning, at the Hall of the house of Representatives, where
							it was performed by the <persRef ref="maffitt-john">Rev’d John Newland Maffit</persRef>, an Irish Methodist,
							Chaplain of the house, and a very celebrated and notorious preacher.— He
							is a man of small stature, from 45 to 50 years of age, with a
							countenance indicating more intelligence than humility or rectitude— He
							was bred a small tradesman in Dublin came to this country, an oratorical
							adventurer nearly thirty years ago, has always been a popular preacher,
							but has lived in sundry parts of the Union, and no where without
							reproach— The hall and all the galleries were crowded to overflowing; we
							pressed in towards the Speakers chair with difficulty and obtained seats
							only by the politeness of strangers who gave us theirs and insisted upon
							our taking them— We found him reading the 53<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Chapter of Isaiah the episcopal first morning of lesson of the day.— He
							reads well; his voice is fine—his articulation theatrically slow and
							distinct; his pronunciation remarkably good, with the occasional use of
							a vulgarism, which he has not yet succeeded in unlearning. His discourse
							was from Isaiah 55.8. [“]For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
							are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. 9. For as the heavens are higher
							than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
							than your thoughts—” The Sermon, had no logical connection with the
							text— It consisted of a multitudinous collection of anecdotes,
							intermingled with pious declamation, about the creation of the world the
							life and adventures of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, of <persRef ref="joseph">Joseph</persRef>, of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, and his fight with
							<persRef ref="goliath ">Goliah</persRef>, of Jesus Christ born in the stable of an inn, of the fishermen
							his first disciples; of <persRef ref="columbus-christopher">Columbus</persRef> and the discovery of America, of <persRef ref="newton-isaac">Sir
							Isaac Newton</persRef>, and the fall of the apple, of the Mayflower and the
							Pilgrims, of the Independence of the United States and the prayers of
							<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> and <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Wellington</persRef> of Sunday Schools, Bible Societies, Missionary
							Societies, Temperance reform and every thing save anti-slavery and
							abolition— He gave notice that this Sermon was a sequel to that which he
							had preached last Sunday; and that he should preach again next Sunday on
							the same subject; from the text—canst thou by searching find out God?
							&amp;c. The Sermon occupied an hour and a quarter and rivetted the
							attention of the whole auditory— He concluded by singing four Stanza’s
							of a methodist hymn, and then pronounced the benediction. After dinner
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read Evening prayers for the second Sunday after the Epiphany, and
							preached from Isaiah—but I forget the chapter and verse— Letter this

						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff came this morning and communicated to me
							the steps that he has taken here in pursuance of his commission as

							commission to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, Secretary of State and
							left it with him— And on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st. </hi>of last Month he
							addressed to him a memorial, claiming the recognition by the Government
							of the United States, of the Isthmus as an Independent State, and
							setting forth the grounds and circumstances of this claim—together with
							a note of the special objects desired for adjustment of intercourse
							between the Isthmus and this Country. <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff</persRef>
							left with me copies of these papers for my perusal, and had a long
							conversation with me upon the course that it may be proper for him to
							pursue in execution of his Commission— His memoir is well written, and
							sets in a clear light the actual position of the Isthmus and the force
							of its claims to recognition— He said that the President and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> both admitted the high importance of this
							subject; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster said perhaps before the
							formal recognition, it might be thought necessary to send a confidential
							agent to the Isthmus to make report of its present condition, as had
							been done in the case of Texas. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff will
							soon call again.— <persRef ref="rhind-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhind</persRef> came with <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> an old friend of his, and told me he had a claim upon
							this Government, which would come before the Committee of Foreign
							Affairs— Rhind was <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson’s</persRef> plenipotentiary to negotiate a
							Treaty with the Sublime Porte.— What his claim is he did not explain. At
							the house, the whole day was again consumed, in driving through the Bill
							to repeal the Bankrupt Law of the last Session, which was finally
							accomplished by yeas and nays 126 to 94. The process was harsh,
							precipitous, and unrelenting— Led on wholly by the Kentucky Claymen—
							<persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> alone succeeded amidst the continual motions for the previous
							question, to crowd in a short Speech against the Bill— <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> made an
							attempt to present petitions for and against the repeal, but was
							frustrated by the rude and arbitrary violence of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>.— I
							demanded that Roosevelt’s point of order should be reduced to writing—he
							refused.— I therefore refused to vote on the question— <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> moved
							I should be compelled to vote, but was not seconded; and I thanked him—
							Adjourned about 5— <persRef ref="gurley-r">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley</persRef> the Colozinationist was

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Relations at ten— Present Adams,

Cost
								Johnson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> who came in after the Committee had adjourned— The
							answer of the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> to Rhett’s resolution of enquiry was
							read—relating to the visitation and search question— The answer is that
							no additional correspondence has been received, and no Instructions yet
							given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett, but that there will
								be<hi rend="superscript"> </hi>soon.— When Rhett came in I read the answer
							to him and he said it was satisfactory.— No other business of moment was
							considered but H. Everett gave notice that at the next Meeting he should
							move to take up the claim of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Margaret Meade. At
							the house the day was occupied in calling the States for Petitions— The
							progress made was northward from Kentucky to New-York— The delay was
							chiefly caused by the presentation of petitions, abolition, anti-slavery
							and for and against the repeal of the bankrupt law. after much desultory
							discussion, these last were all referred to the Committee on the
							judiciary— The abolition petitions which came within the gag-rule were
							all quietly excluded; and every anti-slavery petition which could not be
							disposed of thus, when presented, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>, and <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, interchangeably, move the question of reception, and
							then move to lay the question of reception on the table— The yeas and
							nays were taken several times, and the vote to lay on the table always
							prevailed— At last Granger presented a petition praying Congress to
							secure by Law to the free citizens of the United States, the benefits of
							the Post-Office— The question of reception, and the motion to lay on the
							table followed, and Granger called for the yeas and nays.— This question
							brought the practice of excluding petitions one step beyond all former
							precedent and <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> of Virginia moved to adjourn, though it was but
							just after 3. O’Clock The adjournment was carried by Tellers— <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
							Ingersoll</persRef> succeeded in getting sundry petitions against the repeal of
							the Bankrupt act, referred to the Committee on the judiciary, referred
							with instructions to enquire into the expediency of reporting a bankrupt
							bill free from the defects and supplying the deficiencies of the one
							just repealed— Sundry other Resolutions were offered, but objected
							against and not received— <persRef ref="young-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Augustus Young</persRef> a member
							of the house from Vermont and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb</persRef>, now a
							Clerk in the Treasury Department, spent the Evening with me, in general
							conversation upon political subjects— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young feels
							deeply the degradation of the free and especially the eastern portion of
							the Union, by subserviency to the insolent domination of the Southern,
							slave traders and slave-breeders; but he sees and I see no prospect of
							breaking the yoke in my life-time.</p>

							manufactures the book containing the minutes of the proceedings of the
							former Committees on this subject. The last entry upon which was of 15—
							January 1840. My report of that Committee with an amended bill to
							incorporate the trustees of the fund was made on the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of March 1840. since which nothing has been done by
							Congress concerning it.— The Bill N. 1. of the House Bills, remained on
							the Calendar through the whole remainder of the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congress 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> and 2<hi rend="superscript"

							at the late special Session, first of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress, and in the mean time the funds invested in bonds of the State
							of Arkansas, have depretiated at least fifty per cent— I now stated to
							the Committee that I had called upon the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for a
							statement of the present condition of the fund, which he had promised,
							but had not yet furnished me— I recapitulated again the proceedings of
							the former Committees, and gave copies of my last report to those
							members of the Committee who desired them— Habersham presented a Letter
							from <persRef ref="espy-james">James F. Espy</persRef> proposing that a portion of the fund should be
							appropriated for simultaneous meteorological observations all over the
							union with him for central National meteorologist stationed at
							Washington with a comfortable salary.— Adjourned to next Wednesday at
							10. A.M.— Immediately after the reading of the Journal in the house,
							Benjamin A. Bidlack of Wilkesbarre Pennsylvania, announced the death of
							his colleague Davis Dimock jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> of Montrose with an
							appropriate eulogy, the chief fault of which was that he had not gotten
							it well by heart; with the usual resolutions to wear crape 30 days and
							to adjourn— After which I went into the Senate chamber, and gave to our
							<persRef ref="choate-rufus">Senator Rufus Choate</persRef> an abolition petition to that body from Hingham to
							present— I found <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> of Maine discoursing upon the Treasury
							Note Bill— When he finished <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">Buchanan</persRef> announced the death of Dimock, and
							the Senate adjourned. <persRef ref="hall-frederick">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef> was here this

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef>; to solicit again my
							recommendation of him for an appointment of clerk in the Department of
							State—where he says there is shortly to be a vacancy, by the dismission
							of a young man named <persRef ref="u">Vail</persRef>—a very worthy person, but who has fallen into
							habits of intemperance— <persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomson</persRef>, a son of judge
							<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Smith Thompson</persRef> is now my near neighbour— He came to speak of a claim
							upon the Mexican Government, which he is prosecuting before the joint
							commission now sitting in this city, but which is to terminate on the
								25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thomson fears that the Commissioners will not have time to go through
							with the examination of his claim, and I believe the commission itself
							and the convention by which it was instituted, a fraud to breed a War
							with Mexico—and the annexation of Texas to this Union— <persRef ref="reeves-robert">Robert Reeves</persRef> is
							the man whom the late Secretary of the Treasury <persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Ewing</persRef> removed, as keeper
							of the building, and who then lent me a manuscript of his composition,
							upon controverted politics which I had not time to read— He now brought
							me another manuscript upon Calvinism, Arminianism and
							Transubstantiation, which I shall be equally unable to appretiate— <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff</persRef> came and took back his memorial and
							statement which he had left with me, to read— He has seen the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>,
							but with a crowd of other visitors, so that he had scarcely an
							opportunity of three minutes of private conversation—but the President
							told him, that his proposals as agent for the State of the Isthmus were
							under intense consideration— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff thinks the
							President will now only send an Agent to the Isthmus— I accompanied <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer</persRef> to the War Department to introduce him at
							his reiterated and urgent request to the Secretary, <persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef>.— He
							was not there, but I introduced him to the chief Clerk, <persRef ref="parker-daniel">General Daniel
								Parker</persRef>— I left them, and went to the fourth Auditor <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">A. O. Dayton</persRef>—with
							the Letter from <persRef ref="fogg-ebenezer">Ebenezer T. Fogg</persRef>, Administrator of Howard Freeman alias
							William Johnson and its enclosed documents—a copy of Fogg’s Letter of
							Administration; his order for the payment of the money to me—the
							affidavit of Howard Freemans <persRef ref="u">father</persRef>, and that of another Seaman on board
							the Ohio, of his service until his death— I left these papers with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayton, who sent me this Evening a warrant for the
							money payable by the Navy Agent at Boston, to my order as Attorney to
							the Administrator—signed by the fourth Auditor Dayton and the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Comptroller <persRef ref="parris-albion">Albion K. Parris</persRef>. <pb n="22"
								type="ms"/>At the house, the presentation of petitions under the
							suspended rules was resumed— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> having previously presented
							sundry executive communications— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> enquired of Cushing, Chairman of
							the currency Committee whether a report from them was to be expected
							soon— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> answered that he was ready to report whenever the
							Committee should so instruct him— That they had met twice a week; and
							this week three times— Botts said he was glad to hear it; for he had
							been told that the Committee would not report at-all. At the adjournment
							yesterday, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> had raised the question of reception, and then the
							motion to lay that question on the table, upon a petition presented
							yesterday by <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> from Hopewell, Ontario County, New-York, praying
							for protection in their constitutional right to the use of the
							Post-Office, and adequate Security for their persons in all the States
							of the Union— Wise said that his motive for making the motion was that
							he considered the prayer of the petition to be for the circulation of
							incendiary pamphlets and the protection of incendiary persons.— The
							motion to lay on the table was carried by yeas and nays 101 to 74—and
							the same fate befell many other anti-slavery petitions, including
							Resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Vermont, presented by
							<persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> The call for petitions was continued from New-York to
							Massachusetts. <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina objected to the reception of a
							remonstrance, because it was not a petition— And he objected to the
							reception and moved to lay the objection on the table of a petition for
							the recognition of the republic of Hayti— At this stage a motion was
							made and carried to adjourn.— The weather has been for several days
							almost at Summer heat.— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> is confined to her
							chamber with the influenza; and my catarrhal cough is cruel.</p>

						<p>I had a disturbed—restless and almost sleepless Night occasioned by my
							catarrh, which roused me once from my bed an hour before my usual time
							of rising— The consequence was a languid spiritless drowsy day. <persRef ref="rhind-charles">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhind</persRef> came this morning; and left with me a
							statement of his claim as Commissioner of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> at
							Constantinople for negotiating the Treaty with the sublime Porte,
							together with six appended documents as vouchers—all addressed to me as
							chairman of the Committee of foreign relations. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rhind undertook also to give me a verbal exposition of his claim and
							history of his negotiation, <pb n="23" type="ms"/>but although not
							inexpert in the art of intermingling flattery in his discourse, he had
							so little that of exciting interest in his narrative or his argument
							that I fear their narcotic influence laid me asleep. He said and
							repeated many times that my plan for the Turkish Negotiation was
							admirable; but failed by the overweening vanity of my Agents <persRef ref="crane-william">Commodore
								Crane</persRef>, <persRef ref="offley-david">Offley</persRef> the Consul at Smyrna, and <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef>—every one of whom
							blabbed the secret of his appointment, and thereby blasted the chance of
							success.— At the house, the day was again consumed, by the presentation
							of petitions;— Campbell’s motion to lay on the table his own objection
							to the reception of the petition from Springfield for the recognition of
							the Republic of Hayti, was rejected by yeas and nays—86 to 94. Many
							petitions with the same prayer had for several sessions been received
							and referred to the Committee of foreign relations— <persRef ref="calhoun-william">Calhoun</persRef> and the
							other members from Massachusetts presented all their petitions before I
							began— Many of them were from anti-Slavery petitioners, all of which
							were excluded by the rule, or by being laid on the table. When my turn
							came, I presented first the petition of Martha Piatt, daughter of
							<persRef ref="huddy-joshua">Captain Huddy</persRef>, which was referred to the Committee of Revolutionary
							Pension— Then two Petitions from <persRef ref="catlin-george">George Catlin</persRef> at London: for the
							admission of a work of his upon the Indians—referred to the Committee on
							the Library— Then a Memorial from the Directors of the Columbian
							Institution for the promotion of Science, with the draught of a bill, by
							<persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch</persRef> containing the Constitution of the Society—referred to the
							Committee on the District of Columbia— I presented a petition from
							sundry citizens of Massachusetts praying that the benefits of the
							naturalization Laws may be extended to persons of colour— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> made
							objection to its reception, and moved to lay his own objection on the
							table—carried by yeas and nays 116 to 68— A Petition to Congress to
							secure to each of the States a Republican Government was in like manner
							laid on the table— A Resolution of a Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society
							against a War with England to hold native Americans in Slavery— Wise
							objected to this as not <hi rend="italic">presentable</hi>, because it
							was not a petition—but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> overruled that He then attempted to
							prevent me from reading it; but did not succeed in that—but it was laid
							on the table— I finally presented the petition from Georgia for my own
							removal from the Office of Chairman of the Committee of foreign
							relations, and demanded to be heard in my own defence which produced a
							fractious debate, which was cut off after 4. O’Clock, by the adjournment
							of the house— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky had moved that I should have leave to
							be heard in my own defence— Wise moved to lay the motion on the
							table—rejected 82 to 84. The whole subject laid on the table 94 to
							92.</p>

						<p>Meeting of the friends of the right of petition, in the room of the

							mistook the room— Went to that of the Committee of Post-Offices and
							Post-roads, and finding no body there, came to me afterwards, to enquire
							why the meeting had failed— I had drawn up a sketch, of six Resolutions
							to present to the meeting for consideration— The first three declaring
							the Rule to be unconstitutional—specially oppressive on the free States
							and especially outrageous to the rights of States— And the other three
							proposing remedial measures—the last proposing to form an association of
							members to restore to the People, the suppressed Constitutional right of
							petition, to hold weekly meetings— My draught of Resolutions was read—
							No exception was taken to either of them— But the meeting was so small
							that it was thought best to try for another more numerous meeting next
							Saturday.— At the house <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> from the Committee on the apportionment
							reported a Bill, and sundry documents— The ratio of representation is
							reported is 68000 to each member— A debate of two hours was started. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W.
							Cost Johnson</persRef> moved the recommitment of the Bill to a Committee of one
							Member from each state; but the motion prevailed to refer it to the
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and make it the
							special order of the day for the<space/>of February, and every succeeding

							the house in my own defence <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina voted for it and

						<dateline>Washington Sunday 23 January 1842</dateline>
						<p><date>23. II:— IV:30. </date>Sunday</p>
						<p>Another disturbed, restless and almost sleepless night, with symptoms of
							threatened cramp, followed by a not much more comfortable day.— I
							attended public worship nevertheless, alone at the capitol and heard
							<persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef>, as he announced, upon the necessity
							of divine revelation— His text, as he had last Sunday given notice that
							it would be, was from Job—11.7. [“]Canst thou by searching find out GOD?
							canst thou find out the Almighty, unto perfection? 8. It is as high as
							Heaven, what canst thou do! deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 9.
							The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the
							Sun.—” The hall was crowded to suffocation— I got a Seat in one of the
							Reporters boxes, only by the kindness of <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Christopher Morgan</persRef>, who had it
							and insisted upon my taking it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitts
							eloquence reminds me, more than of any thing else of the froth of spruce
							beer, exceedingly pleasant to the taste—but the mere froth of small beer
							mere gas, without substance and without permanent effect— His
							articulation is slow, distinct, theatrical,—his voice clear, strong
							melodious—his learning the off scouring of Magazines, Reviews,
							Newspapers, and the romances of <persRef ref="scott-walter">Sir Walter Scott</persRef>—his logic, below
							zero—his flights of Fancy, sky rocketish just high enough to be lost in
							the clouds, and his puffs upon the Bible, which he handles as <persRef ref="vanzandt-antonio">signor
							Blitz</persRef> handles his cup and balls, sickening to those who believe it all
							the acting of a part— His power is all imaginative and not pathetic— His
							delivery furnishes an excellent study for a young lawyer, legislator, or
							stump orator, and a theme for philosophical reflection and enquiry what
							is the elementary adamant of attraction which always gathers overflowing
							multitudes to hear a public Speaker— I walked home, and in the afternoon
							attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where <persRef ref="vaningen-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Van Ingen</persRef> of Philadelphia read the Evening service for
							Septuagesima Sunday, and preached from 1. Corinthians 2.4 [“]And my
							speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but
							in demonstration of the Spirit and of power 5 That your faith should not
							stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God—” The text seemed to
							have some application to the contrast between the discourse of the
							preacher, a written Sermon, calm, cool, plain, unadorned, argumentative,
							persuasive, and the rhapsody that I had heard at the Hall of the house
							of representatives this morning. The afternoon auditory was scanty as
							usual—but <persRef ref="howard-george2">Lord Morpeth</persRef> was there, and a subject of much notice— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> was here to visit <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
									Smith</persRef>, and <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goods</persRef>; both of whom are confined to
							their beds— My own indisposition has not yet attained that extent of
							malignity; but if sickness of the heart could confine me, I should be a
							prisoner in my house.</p>

						<p>The <persRef ref="vaningen-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ingen</persRef>, who
							preached yesterday at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church had called

							<persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef>, and requested an interview, with me, which I appointed
							for 9. O’Clock this morning, when he accordingly came. His object was to
							solicit my assistance in behalf of a claim of <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> for military
							bounty land in reward for services of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> father
							in the War of Independence; the claim is before the Committee of private
							land-claims, and is in the charge of <persRef ref="linn-archibald">Archibald L. Linn</persRef> of Schenectady
							New-York— I promised my good will in its favour— <persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								G. L. Thompson</persRef> sent <persRef ref="thompson-mangle">his son</persRef> for a newspaper which he had sent me
							containing a report of certain proceedings of the joint Commission upon
							claims against Mexico, now sitting in this city; and of the umpire <persRef ref="ronne-friedrich">Baron
							Roenne</persRef> the Prussian Minister—but I had not had time to read it; and
							asked the boy to call again to-morrow— At the house the curious decision
							of the house on Saturday, sustaining the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> in pronouncing me out
							of order, upon a point made by Raynor, which the Speaker himself said
							was not the point decided by him came up— I claimed the right to
							proceed; but the house by yeas and nays decided that I should not— This
							arbitrary decision was no sooner announced than <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> started up and
							swaggeringly said—and now is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> turn! and he
							demanded to be heard in defence of himself against charges, which he
							pretended I had made against <hi rend="italic">him</hi>— The rabid
							democrats of the north were all for allowing him, but his motion was
							finally laid on the table—by yeas and nays 101. to 78. and most of those
							who voted for silencing me voted also against silencing him— I then
							renewed the motion to refer the petition to the Committee with
							instructions to choose a chairman if they think proper—debate arising
							thereon it was laid over; and I presented sundry other petitions— One
							from Benjamin Emerson and 45 others of Haverhill, Massachusetts, praying
							Congress, to take measures for peacably dissolving the Union with an
							assignment of three reasons— I moved its reference to a select Committee
							with instructions to report an answer assigning the reasons why the
							prayer of the petition ought not to be granted— Then came another
							explosion, and after snarling debate a Resolution offered by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Thomas W.
							Gilmer</persRef>, that I deserved the censure of the house, for presenting a
							petition praying for the dissolution of the Union— Hot debate arose upon
							this, in the midst of which the house adjourned— I went into the Senate
							chamber, where <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> of South-Carolina was
							speaking against Resolutions presented by <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> of Kentucky, for amending
							the Constitution. He soon finished and the Senate adjourned— Walk home—
							Evening in meditation—</p>

							Proffit were very uneasy and more than once went out and consulted
							together— Gilmer proposed to adjourn supposing the Committee had nothing
							to do— But there were numerous references to the Committee since their
							last meeting of private claims, which were distributed among the members
							for reports— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett said he should prefer to
							wait till next week to present his report upon the claim of <persRef ref="meade-margaret">Margaret
							Meade</persRef>— After the adjournment of the Committee, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cushing said to me that it was the intention of the Southern members of
							the Committee to displace me and elect him Chairman of the Committee,
							and he proposed to excuse himself from taking any part in the movement—
							I said I did not see any reason, why he should withdraw from acting on
							the subject.— He said I had expressed the opinion that he was too much
							prejudiced against England. I said I did not see why that should require
							him to decline, the performance of his duty— At the house, <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>
							obtained by a vote of yeas and nays<space/>a postponement of the privileged
							question (Gilmer’s resolution of censure upon me) till one O’Clock, in
							which he introduced the general appropriation Bills and sundry

							returned from the Senate with an amendment striking out Gilmer’s

							on the table—lost by yeas and nays<space/>to.<space/>At one Gilmer’s resolution
							of censure upon me was taken up— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> offered a much more
							violent one with a flaming preamble charging me in substance with
							subornation of perjury and high treason; and resolutions that the house
							might well expel me, but would only pass upon me the sentence of their
							highest indignation, and turn me over for the rest to my own conscience
							and the contempt of the world— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> received this Resolution, and
							when Marshall finished his speech in support of it called upon me for my
							answer to it, and said the question would be on the adoption of the
							Resolution.— I said I thought it impossible the house should entertain
							the Resolution and after a few remarks postponing my defence till it
							should be ascertained that I stand accused I finished, and was followed
							by <persRef ref="wise-henry">Henry A. Wise</persRef> in a speech of personal <pb n="28" type="ms"/>invective
							upon me, took nearly two hours, and then at the motion of his colleague
							<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>, the house adjourned— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> and <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> invited me to
							go home and dine with them at their lodgings in 4 1/2 street <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>Attended this morning the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest. Present
							Adams, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef>, <persRef ref="randall-benjamin">Randall</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef>— The Documents
							requested from the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> had not been received— The
							Committee got about half an hour, and then adjourned— After which <persRef ref="habersham-richard">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Habersham</persRef> came in— Absent, <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
									Ingersoll</persRef>—<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef> and <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>— I am convinced that nothing will be done of
							any use by this Committee.— In the house, <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> made an attempt to
							take up the Treasury Note-bill, returned from the Senate with an
							amendment striking out <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer’s</persRef> additional section; but <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> objected
							the question of privilege— I addressed the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> referring to the
							Letter from Wise from which I was reading— Wise resumed his philippic
							against me, and kept it up about three hours before he finished— I then
							said that I had determined not to interrupt him till he had disgorged
							his whole cargo of filthy invective, but I thought it impossible that
							the house should entertain the resolution, which charged me with
							subornation of perjury and consequential high treason—crimes for which I
							could only be tried by a regular circuit Court, by an impartial jury—and
							I claimed the benefit of the sixth Article Amendatory to the
							Constitution of the United States— The Speaker required me to reduce my
							point of order to writing which I did, and congratulated the Speaker
							upon his discovery of the expediency of having points of order reduced
							to writing, a favour which he had repeatedly denied to me— He said it
							was a power exclusively possessed by the Speaker But that my demand was
							a question not for him to decide but for the house. I then addressed the
							house and denied their power to try <pb n="29" type="ms"/>me for the
							crimes with which I was charged, and that they had no right to assume
							the guilt without allowing me the privilege of a trial— And as to the
							Resolution itself I denied the right of at least one hundred members of
							the house, to sit in judgment upon me, their personal and pecuniary
							interest in the question carrying such a bias against me, as would make
							them challengeable as jurors in a Court of Law.— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> replied, by a
							County-court subterfuge of argument that the charges of subornation of
							perjury and consequential high Treason were not against me, but against
							the petitioners; and he argued that I might be punished for the contempt
							of the house, although for the same crime I might be tried by the
							judicial tribunals of the Country.— Fillmore finally moved to lay the
							whole subject on the table which was rejected by a vote of 90 to 100.
							and the house adjourned— Evening visits from <persRef ref="skinner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								S. Skinner</persRef>, with <persRef ref="ogden-david3">David B. Ogden</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="birdseye-victory">Victory Birdseye</persRef> a member from
							New-York (Pompey, Onondaga County), who was the Counsel for the State of
							New-York, after <persRef ref="spencer-john">John C. Spencer</persRef> in the Morgan cases, who had spoken to
							me in the house, and now came to mine, to offer me any service of
							assistance that he can give me upon my trial.</p>

							reduce my objection to writing, and suggested himself that it might be

							which I declined being determined that I will not be responsible for the

							question both of time and of power, was of the Speaker’s own suggestion—
							The proceeding was denounced as a trick however by <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef> who gave

						<p><persRef ref="weld-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Weld</persRef> was again here, and undertook to mark the
							passages in <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall’s</persRef> Age of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, recounting the charge against
							him of being under English influence— At the house, immediately after
							the reading of the journal <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> enquired of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> what was the
							business before the house, and was answered that it was the question of
							privilege, on my trial— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> moved a call of the house, which
							was carried and pursued until 201. members answered to their names,
							after which the call was superseded— The question <pb n="31" type="ms"
							/>was upon the motion of <persRef ref="thompson-richard">Richard W. Thompson</persRef> of Indiana, to lay
							<persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall’s</persRef> Resolutions of censure upon me, on the table— Marshall now
							with intense importunity, urged Thompson to withdraw his motion, to give
							Marshall the opportunity to explain and to justify himself, that
							Thompson after much struggling yielded upon condition that Marshall
							after delivering his few words, would renew the motion to lay the whole
							subject on the table.— Marshall then commenced a violent declamatory and
							most eloquent philippic of nearly two hours against me— He laboured with
							agonizing energy to answer the speeches of <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> and of <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef>
							delivered yesterday and was particularly resentful against Underwood— I
							interrupted him occasionally to rectify gross misrepresentations of
							facts, and sometimes to provoke him into absurdity; as for example at
							one part of his speech that the northern abolitionists knew nothing
							about the condition of the Slaves he assumed a courteous tone, and
							invited me to visit the western Country— “To be lynched”—said I—“very
							likely”—said he and proceeded— When he closed he renewed according to
							his pledge to Thompson, the motion to lay the whole subject on the
							table, but said he earnestly hoped it would not prevail; and voted
							against it—when the roll was called upon the question to lay on the
							table Botts rose, and asked if I wished to reply to Marshall; I said I
							would not be responsible for the consumption of one hour of time upon
							concerns merely personal to me— That Marshall had occupied two hours in
							a personal invective upon me found upon principles totally unfounded and
							unjust. Here I was stopped by calls to order and not allowed to answer
							the question— The motion to lay on the table was rejected by yeas and
							nays 96 to 110. and I arose to make my defence— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> interrupted me to
							enquire whether he could not have an opportunity to make a speech in
							support of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> resolutions of censure— The
							Speaker said he would unless the whole subject should be laid on the
							table or the previous question taken. Gilmer then apologized to me for
							interrupting me, and I entered upon my defence I was soon interrupted by
							<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> to defend himself for his share in the <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef> duel, and challenged
							him to name any colleague of mine who ever told him that I had defended
							at a public meeting his innocence in that affair. He said there were
							two—or three of them—they were now present—he would <pb n="32" type="ms"
							/>not name them, but leave them to answer for themselves—and a dead
							silence followed— I caused to be read at the Clerk’s table extracts from
							the report of the majority of the Committee, on the Cilley duel case,
							and from the minority report of <persRef ref="elmore-franklin">Elmore</persRef> in the same case— It was now past
							4. O’Clock, and the request of Botts and many others I yielded the floor
							to him for a motion to adjourn which he made and it was carried— I came
							home to a sick family and to musings for the further defence of myself
							against this persecution.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="choate-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Choate</persRef>, one of the Senators from Massachusetts,
							came this morning, and offered me any assistance that it might be in his
							power to render me, in my present strait, for which I thanked him and
							may perhaps avail myself of his offer— My means of defence requiring
							searches of books and documents, multiplying upon me as I proceed— At
							the House <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved with my consent that the question of privilege
							should be suspended to take up the amendments of the Senate to the
							Treasury Note Bill— I said I consented because I would not be answerable
							for one moment of time consumed on matters merely personal to me. <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph
							R. Ingersoll</persRef> offered a Resolution to suspend my trial, to afford me time
							to obtain information necessary for my defence. 2— To instruct the
							Committee on the judiciary to consult and report upon precedents
							applicable to the case— The Resolutions were objected to by <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> and
							others— But Fillmore’s motion to take up the Treasury Note bill finally
							prevailed against the earnest remonstraces of <persRef ref="sprigg-james">Sprigg</persRef> of Kentucky who
							when it was taken up made a two hours Speech against it— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> then
							moved the previous question.— <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> then made a question of
							privilege that the amendment of the Senate made it a bill for raising
							revenue which it was not when it went from the house; and that the
							Senate could not convert an ordinary bill into a revenue bill, because
							all bills to raise revenue must originate in the house. The Speaker
							overruled this objection— Roosevelt appealed from the decision which was
							sustained by the house 112 to 73—and immediately afterwards Atherton
							repeated it as a point of order.— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> again overruled it—
							<persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> again appealed and again the Speaker’s decision was again
							sustained 117. to 76— <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> moved to lay the Bill on the table.—
							Rejected by yeas and nays 96 to 101— The final question of concurring
							with the Senate, in striking out <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer’s</persRef> section, was carried by a tie
							100 to 100 and the casting vote of the Speaker. I was deeply fearful
							that a reconsideration would be moved; but it <pb n="33" type="ms"/>was
							not and the bill was passed. Fillmore moved immediately to adjourn, but
							<persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">Nathanial G. Pendleton</persRef> of Cincinnati Ohio, started up with a Resolution
							as a substitute for <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall’s</persRef> Resolution of censure upon me.
							Pendleton’s Resolution was a frothy declaration of abhorrence of a
							petition for the dissolution of the Union— That the petition was
							presented by me, and that it be not received Proffit and Mallory two of
							the most inveterate of my persecutors, objected to receiving Pendleton’s
							motion— Nothing but the vengeful malignity of Marshall’s Resolution will
							satisfy them, and yet <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> to throw me off my guard said to me that
							there would be a majority of fifty against Marshall’s Resolution in the
							house— After the presentation by the Speaker of sundry Executive
							Documents, the house adjourned— <persRef ref="dixon-nathan">Nathan Fellows Dixon</persRef>, a Senator from
							Rhode Island, died this morning, so that no public business will be
							transacted in either house of Congress next Monday or Tuesday—</p>

						<p>I attended public worship this morning at the second Presbyterian church,

							[“]Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good

							am sorry to say is so totally absorbed by the trial which the liberties
							of my country are enduring in my person, that it could not rest on the
							words of the preacher, with attention sufficient to consign, any part of
							his discourse to my memory. After dinner there was no service at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>, the
							rector being indisposed— I went to the first Presbyterian church and
							heard a sermon from <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef> the chaplain to the
							House of Representatives— He delivered out for his text John 3.16.
							[“]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
							whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting
							life”— After pronouncing in a slow, distinct, solemn and emphatic tone
							of voice, this verse, and repeating it in the same manner, he said he
							had not come there to deliver a Sermon, but to address the auditory, in
							behalf of the Ladies, constituting the Dorcas Society, whose institution
							was founded upon the purpose of furnishing garments for the poor— And
							from that moment he <pb n="34" type="ms"/>he said not a single word
							having the most distant reference to his text— His discourse was a
							lively, common-place declamation, and importunate sturdy beggary for the
							Ladies of the Dorcas Society— He gave a brief scriptural account of
							Dorcas—who and what she was, and remarked with what propriety the Ladies
							of this institution, which he lauded to the skies, had assumed her name—
							The style of his address was conversational, hortatory and somewhat
							imperative— Without naming me he by his look at me, and gesticulation
							toward me virtually greeted me for my attendance He called upon the
							gentlemen to empty their purses— Upon the ladies to search their
							reticules, and drain them, for cloathing for the poor. Told them to
							give—to give freely—nothing less than dollars.— The house was so crowded
							that I worked my way up with much difficulty to a pew near the pulpit,
							and there only got a seat, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Penrose’s, leaving
							and forcing upon me his own— In the evening I was visited by <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott
								Thayer</persRef>, and by my Colleagues, of the house, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef ref="burnell-barker">Burnell</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-william">Calhoun</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="hudson-charles">Hudson</persRef>, and had much conversation with them, on the peculiarity of my
