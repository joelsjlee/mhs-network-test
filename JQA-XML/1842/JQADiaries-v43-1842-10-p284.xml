                        <p>I was strolling in my garden and nursery, gathering English white oak
                            acorns, and trimming some of my other seedling trees, when I was called
                            into a visit from <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            whom came from the Law school at Cambridge to pass the Sunday with
                            us—After dinner <persRef ref="brewer-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Brewer</persRef> one of the Editors of the Boston Atlas,
                            called, being on his return from Boston to Hingham where he is passing
                            the Summer. He came to urge me to furnish him as soon as possible with a
                            copy of my address at Weymouth on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            of last month— A number of the principal whigs of Boston, during his
                            visit to his farm at Marshfield, gave him an invitation to a public
                            dinner, which he declined, and proposed as a substitute a meeting at
                            Faneuil Hall, where he might exchange greetings with all his fellow
                            citizens, who might be so disposed— This meeting was accordingly held
                            yesterday— The <persRef ref="chapman-jonathan">Mayor of the
                                City</persRef> presided and addressed him in a highly complimentary
                            style, which he answered by a Speech, which was received by a crowded
                            hall, with every external show of enthusiastic applause, but which was
                            bitter as wormwood to nearly the whole of the whig party, and sweeter
                            than honey to the radical democracy.— Boastful, cunning Jesuitical,
                            fawning and insolent, ambiguous in its givings out, avowing his
                            determination not to let them know whether he intends to resign his
                            office or not, arguing all sorts of reasons for his retaining it, but
                            intimating that he may perhaps release his grasp upon it; dealing open
                            blows at the late whig convention for their Resolution of total
                            severance from <persRef ref="tyler-john">John Tyler</persRef>, and sly
                            stabs at <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and me, without naming
                            either of us, the whole purport of his speech was to propitiate the
                            Democracy, and to split up the whigs, and out of the two fragments to
                            make a Tyler party. I promised D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brewer to
                            write out my speech as soon as possible, and that I thought I could have
                            it ready in the course of a week— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb
                                Cushing</persRef> too has had a magnificent reception at
                            Newbury-Port; and the signs of the Tyler party are much stronger than I
                            could have imagined. Brewer told me that he had several Letters from
                            Caleb Cushing against me—particularly written last winter, arguing that
                            the Southern Slave dealers were right, and I was wrong in all the
                            proceeding upon the right of petition— <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                                Lunt</persRef> preached the morning Sermon from John 4.25. [“]The
                            woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called
                            Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 26. Jesus saith
                            unto her, I that speak unto thee am <hi rend="italic">he</hi>.” There is
                            no doubt that the woman of Samaria so understood him, but the words of
                            the original are only I am. The english word he is supernumerary— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not undertake to assign the
                            reason why Jesus Christ revealed himself so directly and expressly as
                            the Messiah, to this Samaritan woman.— It does not appear that she
                            became one of his disciples or ever saw him afterwards— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt considered the personal character of
                            Christ, and the incidents of his life as identified with his religion,
                            and that Christ and Christianity are one. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt administered the communion. <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi

                            partook of it, but took no part in the performance. The infirmities of
                            age have grown upon him, within this last year, more than they had done
                            in five years before— His eldest son, <persRef ref="whitney-george2"

                                >Mary</persRef> nearly about the same time was married to <persRef

                            preached from 2. Corinthians 3.16 [“]But we all with open face beholding
                            as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image,
                            from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord”—and 4.6 [“]For
                            God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness both shined in our
                            hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
                            face of Jesus Christ.” There is something mystical in the text not easy
                            to be understood, and there was more in the discourse— The annual
                            collection forgotten in the morning was taken up in the afternoon, and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney just made out to give notice

                            them up in this State— His courtship of the democracy is lascivious. And
                            he evidently relies upon his transition to them. Next after them came

                            Tragedies— He came to ask me to furnish an Article for a monthly
                            magazine which he is about to establish in New-York, and the first
                            number of which is to be published in December, like most others of

                            earnestness was intense and he seemed inclined to take no denial— This
                            Spirit is flattering and humiliating. Its tendency is to make me fancy
                            myself popular and to mistake notoriety for fame. I have no article on

                            nothing which could add a particle even to my notoriety— It occurred to

                            nomination by the whigs furnishes by no means conclusive evidence of
                            what turn the election may take— The democracy have the majority in the
                            County of Norfolk— Their convention for the nomination of a candidate is
                            to be held next Tuesday— Besides which there is a strong abolition party
                            in the District, and a considerable portion if not the whole of that
                            party will not vote for me, but for a candidate of their own— They have
                            defeated an election in the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> district
                            consisting chiefly of the same towns; and they may if they please defeat

                        <p><date>6. IV.45. </date>Thursday.</p>
                        <p>Sun rose 6.2. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 32. White frost.</p>
                        <p>Sky clear—but a long strip of cloud, bordering the horizon, eastward and
                            southward intercepted the Sun in his rising for about ten minutes— My
                            writing nailed me down to the table all morning; but after dinner, I
                            went alone in the carriage to Boston— I left it at the stable, with
                            directions to <persRef ref="taryhill-philip">Philip the
                                coachman</persRef> to call for me at a quarter before 9. at the door

                            gone out riding, and had left a paper fastened to the nameplate on the
                            door— Home 7. Thence I called upon my old friend <persRef

                            vigorous, how sprightly I knew him more than 50 years ago! Old age! oh!

                            250 years after they were written.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall
                            told me that he had not been out of the city for eleven years— After
                            sitting and chatting with him about half an hour I went to <persRef

                            tea with him but he had received a call of business to Lowell, and had

                                    >r</hi> George T. Bigelow</persRef> met us at the side door— I
                            avoid on these occasions every possible appearance of parade or
                            ostentation.— The house a very large one, was crowded to the brim, and
                            the whole auditory rose as we went in— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lawrence who is the President of the Lyceum, introduced me with a few
                            complimentary phrases, which were received with applause and precisely
                            at half past 7. I began the delivery of my lecture, which I finished a
                            quarter before 9. It was the Lecture which I wrote two years ago, upon
                                <persRef ref="filmer-robert">Filmer</persRef>, <persRef

                            but which I had never before delivered. It was so dull that I scarcely
                            hoped that it would be listened to with patience, and yet the attention
                            of the audience never flagged for a moment. M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Lawrence handed me a note from <persRef

                            publish some extracts from it— <persRef ref="brewer-thomas">D<hi

                            his house who wanted me to come to Boston, and make a political speech;
                            but he said I could see them on Saturday. From the Odeon I got
                            immediately into my Carriage, and returned, as I had gone alone to
                            Quincy— Reached home 20 minutes past 10.</p>

                            rest of the sky was cloudless, intercepted for about 10 minutes the
                            sight of the rising Sun; but the day was clear and the temptation to
                            range abroad for air and exercise abridged the time that I could devote
                            to writing.— While we were at dinner <persRef ref="bacheleder-jacob"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob Bachelder</persRef> came,
                            deputed from the Lyceum at Lynn, to repeat the invitation of several
                            successive years, for a lecture— I had promised one last Autumn, which
                            my eruption on the head prevented me from delivering. There were then
                            two rival Lyceums each claiming the performance of my promise, and now
                            there is another invitation from an Association of young men in Lynn,
                            which comes in collision with this one from the Lyceum— I gave M<hi

                            promised to make it certain as soon as possible— <persRef

                            afternoon visit from Boston— Early after dinner I found myself dosing as
                            I sat writing at my table as now frequently happens—old age and physical
                            nature sinks under the effort to occupy every moment of my time with
                            useful labour— I went forth, ranging over what <persRef key="adams-john"
                                >my father</persRef> used to call Stonyfield hill; but from which he
                            removed so many stones, and out of which my Son <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> has blasted so many rocks,
                            that it may now with more propriety be called Greenfield hill.— From the
                            fragments of the rocks Charles has also built round a large portion of
                            the lot a Stone wall, which may last a century, but which may more
                            probably within that time be broken up for house lots or cut through for
                            Streets. In my walk I found <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="mooney-dennis">Dennis Mooney</persRef>, digging up

                            and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the Evening
                            with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and the two

                            resumed my writing out of my speech at Weymouth—where wilds immeasurably
                            spread, seem lengthening as I go. I answered the Letter from <persRef

                        <p>Thick fog rose with the Sun—soon dispersed.</p>
                        <p>I was not aware when I rose, how much of the night remained before
                            Sunrise: but I sat down to work as soon as I was dressed, an operation
                            which takes me from half an hour to an hour every morning and I had not
                            one minute to spare throughout the day— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi

                            from Psalm 51.6. “Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts”— It
                            was a funeral discourse on the decease of <persRef
                                ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Ellery
                                Channing</persRef>, and a noble tribute of honour to his Memory.— He
                            spoke in general terms of his early writings, and of the general
                            character of his mind and of his compositions— He was one of the most
                            eminent writers upon religion, morals and politics that this country has
                            produced— Writing always in the genuine spirit of Christianity, with the
                            tenderness of a father to his children; and always looking to the
                            improvement and purification of the human character, especially in the
                            humbler and indigent classes of the community— His recent labours have
                            been chiefly confined to promoting the cause of universal liberty, and
                            the extinction of Slavery and the Slave-trade throughout the Earth— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did him ample justice on this point.
                            He gave a short extract from the last Address delivered at Lenox on the
                            first day of last August and spoke of it in terms of enthusiastic
                            applause— This was very creditable to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunt, in as much as D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Channing’s course has
                            on this subject has been too bold and anti-servile for the timid and the
                            time serving friends of freedom— D<hi rend="superscript">r.
                            </hi>Channing never flinched or quailed before the enemy— But he was
                            deserted by many of his followers, and lost so many of his parishioners
                            that he had yielded to his colleague <persRef ref="gannett-ezra">E. S.
                                Gannett</persRef>, the whole care of his pastoral Office, giving up
                            all claim to salary, and reserving only the privilege of occasionally
                            preaching to them at his convenience— The loss of D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing to the anti-slavery cause is
                            irreparable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon sermon was
                            from Matthew 26.24. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but
                            woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! he omitted the
                            remainder of the verse—It had been good for that man if he had not been
                            born— The believers in eternal punishment draw momentous inferences from
                            that averment— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Whitney</persRef> was in the pulpit all day, and made
                            the prayer before sermon this afternoon; but he could hardly articulate
                            so as to be heard— My attention was so much dissipated that I retained
                            the memory of scarcely any thing, and am under great depression of
                            spirits.</p>

                            in which it was made, and for the Resolutions with which it was
                            accompanied; and I promised an answer as soon as I shall be able to

                        <p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and
                            returned to dine. I wrote to <persRef ref="bigelow-george">M<hi

                            on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month— I found this
                            absolutely necessary to justify a refusal to attend at any public
                            political meeting before my return to Washington— I accordingly wrote an
                            answer declining an invitation to a public dinner at Sandwich, and on
                            turning over my letters recently received, to endorse and file them, I
                            found one which I had totally forgotten from <persRef

                            month in celebration of the introduction of the Croton water into the
                            City— There was on the note a twice repeated request for an answer,
                            which I had overlooked till now— I answered the Letter declining the
                            invitation, and sent it to <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillett</persRef>
                            to be taken by him to morrow morning to Boston, and put into the
                            post-office so that it may reach New-York on Thursday, the day before
                            the feast— My unceasing drudgery in writing out the supplement to my
                            Weymouth speech, continues unabated and has come to a blister my
                            fingers— I stole half an hour to plant a second row of English white Oak
                            acorns fresh gathered from the tree; in the patch at the N. West corner
                            of the house— Also some acorns and horse chesnuts in the seminary—Most
                            of the white Oak Acorns shrivel up even before falling from the tree—
                            They also change their colour from green to brown; and after changing
                            their colour float upon water— Most of the green ones barely sink.
                            Towards evening <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            of whigs in Bristol County next week on Wednesday, and address them—at
                            or near Taunton, and with another invitation to me to visit my friends
                            at New Bedford, both of which I declined— Sunset clear at 5.28— Charles
                            and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the evening
                            here— The multitude of applications to me to deliver addresses and
                            Lectures, with which I cannot comply has brought me to the conclusion of
                            returning in the first week of next month to Washington, to see if I can
                            obtain a few days of leisure and repose there. Charles at my request saw

                                Choate</persRef> at Boston this morning— He does not consider
                            himself as having made any engagement to come out and deliver an Address
                            to the whigs of Quincy— Nor does he expect that I should attend and
                            introduce him— With regard to his opinions he was quite reserved.</p>

                            came this morning for my answer to their invitation to me, to attend a
                            meeting of the whigs of Quincy, and introduce to them <persRef

                            who has promised to make them a speech— I told them that I had come to
                            the conclusion that I could not with propriety attend—first because I
                            had invariably since I had held the Office of President of the United
                            States forborne attending and taking part in any electioneering public
                            meeting, and secondly because I know not what the sentiments of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Choate were and perhaps he might express
                            opinions with which I might not concur; and then I should be held
                            responsible for his opinions, or under the necessity of contesting them
                            which would tend rather to dissension than to harmony among the whigs—
                            They acquiesced in my determination— But enquired anxiously if it was
                            true that I had declared it as my opinion that <persRef
                                ref="dorr-thomas">Thomas W. Dorr</persRef> was now the lawful
                            Governor of Rhode Island— I told them certainly not. It is a lie,
                            published in the Boston Morning Post, originating in my having
                            undertaken to defend <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J.

                            them that <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> had at my
                            request seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Choate, who had told him
                            that he had not expected that I should be present at the Meeting here at
                            which he proposed to address the whigs— <persRef ref="randall-ephraim"

                            afterwards at Westford—but is now at large, unoccupied and living on a
                            small farm at Dorchester.— He is in want of employment and of
                            subsistence for the winter, and came to enquire if there would be any

                            the small unitarian church at Fishkill landing and at the same time to
                            keep a school or to teach church music. I gave him no encouragement, but
                            told him I would ascertain and inform him if he would call again in the

                            invitation of themselves and as deputies from the Ladies of Milton to
                            attend a meeting of a Pic-Nic, next Thursday afternoon at 4. O’Clock,
                            for the benefit of the Milton Lyceum during the coming winter, and that
                            I would give them an address on that occasion.— This Lecture and address
                            hunting is becoming annoying, and makes me feel ridiculous— I excused
                            myself to the Ladies as well as I could, but I could scarcely refrain
                            from laughter, on saying no, to four women asking me to address them— I
                            received this morning by the mail a proof sheet of the Atlas, containing
                            the first part of my address to my constituents at Weymouth on the 17<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month— It makes six columns of
                            the paper and yet contains not half the speech, dilated as it is in
                            writing it out. It took me three hours to deliver it, and what I have
                            written and shall write will take more than three hours to read— The
                            part now printed reads to me excessively dull and very clumsily put
                            together— The second part will be more methodical, and perhaps for that
                            reason more dull— I see there is on it a great want of point. The more I
                            speak the more I feel my deficiency in the art of speaking, and the want
                            of the faculty of compression.— I revised the proof, and took it to the
                            Post Office directed to the Editors of the Atlas. At the same I called
                            at the Bank, and deposited a check for 200 dollars, on the Merchants

                                <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef>, both for
                            re-election as Governor, and for the Office of Vice President, and that

                            the Atlas next week, and would give the whigs all the assistance which I
                            believed it in my power to afford. I mentioned to them my engagement to

                        <p>Sun rose. 6.13. Crystal clear. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 40.</p>
                        <p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunt</persRef> this morning from Ecclesiastes 1.18— He had read the
                            whole chapter, and then the two verses which conclude the Book. ch. 12.
                            V. 13. “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
                            keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 14. For God
                            shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether
                            it be good, or whether it be evil.”— The 18<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th</hi> verse of the first chapter is “For in much wisdom is much
                            grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.” The latter
                            part of the verse only was the text. A difficult theme to handle for it
                            seems to discourage the pursuit of knowledge— There are adverse
                            doctrines on that subject in the old Testament— The fruit of the
                            forbidden tree in Paradise was knowledge—The knowledge of good and evil—
                            The supreme good of the Grecian Philosophers— The Song, the Proverbs,
                            and the Book of Ecclesiastes, present in striking contrast and relief,
                            three stages of the life of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— It
                            was impossible for Solomon to have written the Ecclesiastes in his youth
                            or the Song in his old age— The song is the effusion of love and joy—
                            The Proverbs are the fruits of long observation and experience in the
                            ways of men—<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespears</persRef>
                            Justice, full of fat capon, wise saws and modern instances. The
                            Ecclesiastes is the lean and slipper’d pantaloon; verging already to the
                            last stage of all.— In the Proverbs, the instruction to his son is get
                            Wisdom—get understanding— The ways of Wisdom are ways of Pleasantness,
                            and all her paths are peace— In the Ecclesiastes—[“]In much wisdom is
                            much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth Sorrow”—how is
                            all this to be reconciled? Is it all inspiration? Might not a very
                            anxious parallel be drawn between the lives and history of Solomon and
                            of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis Quatorze</persRef>— The same
                            supernatural promise in Youth—the same consummate prosperity—the same
                            weariness of life and uxorious idolatry in old age— To Solomon all was
                            Vanity— <persRef ref="daubigne-francoise">Madame de Maintenon</persRef>
                            found it insupportable Slavery to entertain a man who was no longer
                            amusable. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was
                            from 1. Corinthians 10.31. [“]Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or
                            whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” Before dismissing the
                            congregation, he <hi rend="superscript">x</hi> read the Letter of
                            invitation from the South Church at Boston to the Church at Quincy (<hi

                            nominated me to go with him as a delegate, for which the members
                            silently raised their hands and it was thus ordained. I was up writing

                        <p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Booth</persRef>, from Boston,
                            introduced by <persRef ref="burrell-seth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Burrell</persRef> of this town, came with a subscription paper for
                            building a methodist episcopal church in Boston— I declined, observing
                            that I thought in so opulent a city as Boston, the people should pay for
                            building and maintaining their own churches— He said these people were
                            very poor. I replied that might be a good reason for them not to
                            undertake the building of a church.— There were already more churches
                            than there were worshipers to fill them; and the tendency of every new
                            church built was to withdraw from other churches of the same
                            denomination. he admitted that this was sometimes the case in villages;
                            but he was sorely disappointed at my declining to suscribe— <persRef
                                ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Brigham</persRef> called this afternoon, for my definitive answer to
                            the invitation to address the whigs of the County of Norfolk, in the
                            course of this month at Dedham. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Brigham that I must definitively decline: and I believe I convinced M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham, that it would be better for the
                            whig party as well as for myself that I should abstain from attendance
                            at any of these public meetings at this time— Towards sunset, finding
                            myself falling asleep over my paper while writing I was walking up the
                            hill, when <persRef ref="grinnell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Joseph Grinnell</persRef> of New-Bedford, overtook me in a Chaise
                            and delivered to me a Letter signed by 17. very respectable citizens of
                            that town, earnestly intreating me to attend the great whig meeting at
                            Taunton next Wednesday; and I had received a very kind and warm
                            invitation from <persRef ref="marston-john3">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> John Marston</persRef> of that town to his house. I
                            repeated to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grinnell all the reasons
                            which I had given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham and to the
                            Committee from Boston, for declining to attend there public meetings;
                            and added that I was now under an engagement for Wednesday—which would
                            render my attendance at Taunton impossible— He wished me to answer the
                            Letter from the 17 gentlemen of New Bedford, so that my answer could be
                            read at the meeting; but that would be difficult, and I believe
                            inexpedient— The first part of my Braintree reception speech was
                            published in the Boston Atlas of this morning, and they sent me 6 copies
                            of the paper containing it. I took one of them to the Office of the
                            Quincy Patriot, requesting of the Pressmen that it might be republished
                            in the Patriot next Saturday. <persRef ref="green-john3">M<hi

                            introduced Walter to the <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"

                            which all the portraits are ranged, new varnished and freshened—but the

                            to visit <persRef ref="johnson-william4">William Johnson</persRef> of
                            Utica, who is one of the students in the law school. I met in the yard
                                <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Saltonstall </persRef>who was also one of the members of the
                            Committee. At the meeting I was chosen Chairman for the day. President
                            Quincy read reports from the several professors of the Divinity and Law
                            Schools, and of all the Professors, Tutors and teachers of the
                            Undergraduates—all of which were very satisfactory. The President’s own
                            report came last, and spoke of the general state of the University, as
                            favourable, with two exceptions— One a brutal explosion by gun-powder in
                            one of the buildings, last July, the perpetrator of which has not been
                            discovered— The other is a disorderly and outrageous mutiny in the
                            Senior class begun, by one member of the class breaking the windows of
                            another named <persRef ref="u">Burchard</persRef>, and then a succession
                            of personal violence, and cruelties implicating at last the whole class
                            to drive away Burchard from the College— The last movement is a
                            Statement in a Boston Newspaper by authority of the whole class against
                            the faculty— The statement was referred to a Committee of 3 members to
                            report thereon to the board of Overseers at their next Meeting— The

                                Tileston</persRef>, from Dorchester was here yesterday while I was
                            at Cambridge, and came again this morning to persuade me to deliver a
                            political address to the whigs of that town, some day in the course of
                            this month— I repeated for the thirtieth time the reasons which have
                            brought me to the conclusion that it is my duty to abstain from
                            attending any public meeting to discuss political topics at this time;
                            and I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tilestone that my sentiments
                            upon the most interesting political topics of the present times were
                            embodied in the report of my address to my Constituents at Braintree the
                                17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September; partly published in

                            days, yesterday and this day, suspending the possibility of my bringing
                            the report of my speech to a conclusion— I went to <persRef

                        <p>Retiring to bed at Midnight, I rose this morning proportionally late, and
                            that threw my whole day into arrears. The pressure upon my brain is so
                            severe, that I am not without concern for the preservation of my reason.
                            And I see no end yet to the Braintree speech— <persRef

                            bring me home after the Lecture— This rage for lecturing and for

                            misprinted, but I revised it, till it was tolerably correct. It is the
                            poorest thing I ever wrote; and I believe I should have done better by

                            writing. <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            Parnell was very desirous of my attendance at the Lecture, and I
                            promised to go— I received a note from <persRef ref="sumner-charles2"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Sumner</persRef>,
                            telling me that <persRef ref="jay-william">judge William Jay</persRef>
                            of Bedford, New-York would come out with <persRef
                                ref="jay-eliza;jay-augusta">his two daughters</persRef> to visit me
                            this afternoon, with him, and they accordingly came and took tea with
                            us— The judge is the youngest of the two sons of <persRef ref="jay-john"
                                >John Jay</persRef>, and was born in New-York, after his return from
                            France in 1784. He spoke to me of <persRef ref="sparks-jared">Jared
                                Sparks’s</persRef> false Statements, denying the duplicity of the
                            French Government in the Negotiation for Peace of 1782. and of his
                            disingenuousness in suppressing the intercepted Letter of <persRef

                            the Revolutionary diplomatic correspondence entrusted to him by <persRef

                            is difficult to ascribe to mere infatuation the engouement of Sparks for
                            Franklin— It is that sort of fanaticism which sweeps away all a man’s
                            honesty— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay said that <persRef

                            sent, had made some marginal notes on it, and among the rest, one,
                            declaring it true, that in that Negotiation, <persRef

                            British Government to deprive the people of this Union of their share of
                            the Newfoundland fishery. <persRef ref="brown-george2">M<hi

                            and his family. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown came as a deputy
                            from the Lyceum with a Resolution he said of bringing me with him
                            bodily. I told him I would go to Beverley if possible; and would let him
                            know when, as soon as possible— At 7. in the Evening I went with
                                <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> to the Hancock
                            house and heard the lecture of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parnell
                            who said he had known me formerly, but I did not remember him— His
                            Lecture, after a short essay upon the four temperaments—the Nervous, the
                            sangwine, this lymphatic, magnetised a young man, with the aid of
                            another by waving their hands over his head, and by touching his head
                            with a magnetic tractor—laid him asleep, and made him practice many
                            contortions in that condition—I thought it a mere farce.</p>

                                <persRef ref="lawrence-samuel2">Samuel Lawrence</persRef> the latter
                            of whom presented to me, a copy of a Resolution adopted at a meeting of
                            the whigs of Lowell last Saturday Evening, in the highest degree
                            complimentary to me with a very earnest invitation to me that I would
                            deliver an address to the whigs of that city previous to the approaching
                            election— A second Resolution that Samuel Lawrence Esq<hi

                            invitation; and a third that a copy of it be forwarded to me— I answered
                            as I have fortunately done to all the applications for political
                            addresses to be delivered with reference to the elections; expressing my
                            gratitude for the honour done me by the invitation; but that I had
                            declined and must decline all invitations to deliver addresses to
                            political meetings— But I said I had received an invitation to deliver a
                            lecture before the lyceum at Lowell, which I had not answered— I would
                            engage to go some day the week after next and deliver that lecture,
                            which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Lawrence said would answer
                            just as well as an address; for what the people of Lowell wanted was to
                            see and hear me; and so it is with all these importunate invitations— It
                            is the same curiosity under the spur of which the flock and pay to see
                            the Ourang Outang, the Mermaid the Anaconda, or the Rhinoceros.— Soon
                            after these Gentlemen went away two persons announcing themselves as
                            Baptist clergymen from New Hampshire, <persRef ref="u;u">brothers by the

                            converse with me— I did converse with them freely for about an hour—one
                            of them, apparently the younger was wholly silent—the other, cheerful
                            and talkative, and both very well bred— <persRef ref="green-john3">M<hi

                            from the Norfolk County Society for the suppression of intemperance, I
                            have some reason to believe that the members of the Committee from this
                            town, who have been very busy in this matter, are actuated by no

                            preached this morning from Acts 17.11. [“]These were more noble than
                            those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness
                            of mind, and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were
                            so.”— This is the remarkable chapter, closing with the discourse of
                                <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> at Athens, but he had before
                            passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Thessalonica and Berea and it
                            is of the inhabitants of this last city, that the testimony is borne of
                            their superior nobility, or as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            expounded it, ingenuousness to that of the Thessalonians. The Scriptures
                            which at that time they searched must have been the Books of the Old
                            Testament— The Law and the prophets— To the jews Paul preached Jesus
                            Christ, as the Messiah foretold in the Scriptures—and the Bereans daily
                            searched the scriptures whether those things were so, but when he came
                            to Athens the Jewish Scriptures were of no Avail. There he had to deal
                            with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, whose enquiry was what will this
                            babbler say? To them he came to explain who that unknown God was to whom
                            they had built an altar. And with what power he opened to them the
                            character of the true God, the creator of all worlds.— I often think
                            what Cicero would have said if he been one of Paul’s auditory upon Mars
                            hill—he who speculated so profoundly upon the Nature of the Gods—what
                            light would have flashed upon his mind, if the idea had been presented
                            to it of one God—creator of the worlds—creator of one man and one woman
                            from whom were descended the whole human race—all of one blood;
                            therefore all equal. If Paul had told him that the philosophical enquiry
                            of man, was not selfish enjoyment the supreme good—but the depravity of
                            his own nature—repentance, and judgment after death— This would be a
                            good subject for a lecture—a dialogue between Cicero and S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul— Let me think of it—Cicero de Natura
                            Deorum, and Paul at Athens— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
                            afternoon Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 15.46 “How be it, that was not
                            first, which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that
                            which is spiritual.”— By the natural body is meant the material body,
                            which it seems to say was created before the spiritual body— The great
                            argument for the resurrection of the body is in truth an argument for
                            the immortality of the soul— It rests entire inference from the
                            resurrection of Christ— I went up the hill to observe the setting Sun
                            but he was sinking behind a camel’s back mound. <persRef

                            of September—about 85 pages in all— With the Lecture on Temperance it

                            daily record of this diary make an average of 3 close written pages a
                            day— My powers would not bear a severe stretching— Just before dinner,
                            five very respectably looking men of colour, three Negroes and two light
                            mulattos, came as a delegation from a meeting of the People of colour in
                            Boston, at which they told me, upwards of 500 persons were present, to

                            of their mission. I answered them, expressing my grateful sensibility to
                            the coloured people of Boston, for this mark of their confidence in me,
                            and said I would cheerfully comply with their invitation if I were still
                            in the practice of the Law—but that for more than 30 years, I had been
                            withdrawn from it by othe occupations, and except in one instance about
                            2 years ago, when I argued before the Supreme Court of the United States
                            the Cause of the captive Africans of the Amistad, I had never resumed
                            the practice— I had now one contingent engagement to defend M<hi

                            myself justified in attempting to address a Court and Jury— But they

                        <p>From the moment of my rising till 8. O’Clock near 4 hours I was revising
                            the manuscript of the second part of my reception Speech at Braintree;
                            and I sent it by <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> to the

                            residing at Matanzas in the years 1839. 40 and 41. and was appointed by
                            two successive Consuls their official agent during the times of their
                            absence—and after the death of <persRef ref="shoemaker-lewis">M<hi

                                    >r</hi> Forsyth</persRef> then Secretary acknowledged the
                            receipt of his communications in performance of the consular functions—
                            Last year at the complaint of two woman of bad character he was arrested
                            by the municipal authorities of Matanzas, kept in prison 147 days, and
                            then released without a trial. The charge against him was of having
                            taken possession of the property of a woman of this country who died in
                            the house, with the two complainants. He had not taken possession of one
                            Article of the property but only took an inventory of her effects after
                            her decease. The complaint was made a year afterwards, and was utterly
                            groundless— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cross supposed the Government
                            of the United States bound to obtain from the Spanish Government redress
                            and indemnity for him, as Vice Consul of the United States as Vice
                            Consul; but <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Webster</persRef> had told him 1. that neither of the two Consuls,
                            was authorised to appoint a Vice Consul and 2. That Consuls had no
                            privilege of exemption from arrest, imprisonment or trial, by the Laws
                            of the Country where they exercised their functions— But that
                            representations in his behalf should be made to the Spanish Government.
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cross was here twice and asked my
                            advice whether he should petition Congress. I told him if he wished it,
                            I would present his petition, but that they would refer it to the
                            Secretary of State, whose answers to him had been all correct, and this
                            Government could not hold itself responsible for the wrongs he had
                            suffered at Matanzas. I advised him to see M<hi rend="superscript"

                            Walley would receive my note, containing that assurance before the
                            express would reach him— <persRef ref="crosby-nathan">M<hi

                            pledge of total abstinence from the use of all spirituous liquors. I
                            told him I thought the <hi rend="italic">requiring</hi> of the pledge of
                            total abstinence was an error, to which I would give no countenance; and
                            my address was composed altogether on that principle. He argued the
                            question with me, perseveringly, but in good humour and without
                            producing conviction or subscription.— <persRef

                            eyes and voice have been so much affected by an hour’s reading by dim
                            lamp lights in heated and crowded halls, that I had doubts whether I
                            should be able to deliver my lecture at Roxbury as I had promised. The
                            remainder of my reception Address at Weymouth landing 17. September, is
                            published in the Atlas of this morning and occupies nine columns of that
                            paper. This took me 3 hours to revise, and visitors absorbed the
                            remainder of the day till at 5 in the afternoon the Carryall was at the

                            They said their hall would hold double the number of hearers, whom the
                            hall of the eldest Lyceum could contain, and that many of their members

                        <p>My first visitor this morning was <persRef ref="southwick-david">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Southwick</persRef> a young man about
                            25. who came from Mendon to see me, and the houses in which <persRef
                                key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and I were born, and the house
                            in which I live, and its furniture and pictures, and everything about
                            it— He sat with me upwards of an hour, almost the whole time silent,
                            asking about once in five minutes some question about my father or
                            myself—answering very briefly what questions I asked of him—seeming
                            afraid to say what brought him here, and yet sitting like a fixture to
                            the house, while I was in torture wishing him to go away without daring
                            to hint to him that my time was my treasure. At last he enquired if I
                            had any spare copies of any of my published writings to sell— I said no,
                            but had some that I would give him and I did give him an Eulogy on
                                <persRef ref="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef>, a Jubilee of the

                            for them which I declined— He was scarcely gone when <persRef

                            to save the State— I well knew that my going there and addressing the
                            whigs would not have the weight of a straw to save the State; and it was
                            equally clear that the State cannot be saved— I satisfied <persRef

                        <p><persRef ref="flint-james">Doctor Flint</persRef> of Salem preached this
                            morning from Matthew 5.48. “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
                            which is in heaven is perfect.” This command of Jesus Christ; to his
                            disciples, in his sermon on the mount to be perfect, as God is perfect,
                            is perhaps the strongest exemplification of the specific character of
                            the Christian dispensation to be found in the New Testament. The essence
                            of the doctrine of regeneration is that a man must purify himself into
                            another being and assume a new nature— That he must extirpate from his
                            own bosom all the selfish passions, and be born again to become a new
                            man— Whether that doctrine applies to persons born and bred under the
                            Christian dispensation, or was intended only for the Jews and Gentiles
                            of his own times may admit of question— The Jew, born under the Law. the
                            Heathen bred under the Grecian Mythology, could become Christians only
                            by conversion. And it was in answer to the enquiries of <persRef
                                ref="nicodemus">Nicodemus</persRef>, a Pharisee, ruler of the Jews
                            that Jesus revealed the doctrine of regeneration— All the precepts of
                            Christianity are commands to aim at perfection— The injunctions to love
                            our neighbours as ourselves, and to do unto others as we would that they
                            should do unto us, are calls to perfection, and this peremptory order to
                            be as perfect as God, is the same thing in other words—change your
                            natures—strip yourselves of all your evil propensities—become new men—be
                            born again—be perfect, as God is perfect— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Flint’s discourse terminated, somewhat strangely by a laudatory

                            the rite of confirmation to about 20 persons. D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Flint’s afternoon sermon was from 1. Peter 4.7. “But the end
                            of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.”

                            has been starting a religious panic in this neighbourhood by the
