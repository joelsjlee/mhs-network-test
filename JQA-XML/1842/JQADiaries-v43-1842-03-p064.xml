                        <p><persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilbert Livingston Thompson</persRef> had called upon me
                            yesterday, and urgently requested me to bring before the Committee of
                            foreign Affairs the claims and complaints against the Commission of
                            indemnities under the convention of 1839 with Mexico.— The Commission
                            expired last week and left much of their business undone— I met the
                            Committee of Foreign Affairs at 10 this morning— All the members
                            present—Adams, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-edward">E. D. White</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef>—<persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>, <persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef> and <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H. H. Stuart</persRef>.— There was a
                            Letter from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>, with an enclosure from <persRef ref="porter-david">David Porter</persRef>,
                            claiming extra-allowances, under another name, for his son, which the
                            <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> auditor</persRef> had rejected but which the
                            Secretary of State now acquiesces in— After some discussion this claim
                            was laid aside— The consideration of the report on <persRef ref="meade-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs</hi> Meade’s</persRef> claim was further postponed <persRef ref="baldwin-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Baldwin’s</persRef> memorial against the Mexican indemnity commission, was then
                            taken up, discussed, and postponed for future consideration of what the
                            Committee can do— I thought the chairman should be directed to move in
                            the house a call on the Department of State for the proceedings of the
                            Commission— But the Committee were for not going so fast.— They thought
                            it would be best to wait.— In the house, <persRef ref="pendleton-nathanael">Pendleton’s</persRef> motion to suspend
                            the rules for his indignant resolution against dissolution petitions,
                            first came up and was lost for lack of a two thirds majority, the vote
                            being 104 to 65— Then followed attempts to introduce sundry Resolutions,
                            and after the remainder of the morning hour absorbed on the retrenchment
                            Committee’s report the house went into Committee of the whole on the
                            state of the Union, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the chair on the general appropriation
                            Bill, after two abortive attempts of <persRef ref="bidlack-benjamin">Bidlack</persRef> of Pennsylvania, to take up
                            the apportionment Bill. <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> with a superabundant zeal for
                            retrenchmen, grafted upon the Bill an amendment to reduce the expense,
                            and direct the mode of printing the Laws in pamphlets and newspapers—
                            The Chairman pronounced it not in order, as surely it was not— But Davis
                            appealed, and there was no quorum. The Committee rose— A call of the
                            house produced a Quorum. Briggs resumed the Chair—debate followed till
                            the Committee rose again and the house adjourned— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here
                            this evening—read 3 chapters of the Pickwick papers— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

                                    >rs</hi> Angier</persRef> went to the Drawing-room, which was splendid.— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My

                            Quorum— Conversation upon the manner of canvassing votes at elections in
                            Kentucky— Treating— Barbecues. Small loans of one or two dollars to be
                            forgotten. Tavern bills paid half and half by the candidates— In the
                            house, on the motion of <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> a Resolution was adopted that from and
                            after next Wednesday the daily hour of adjournment shall be 11. O’Clock
                            A.M. till further order— But <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">Taliaferro</persRef> gave notice that he should move
                            a reconsideration of this vote to morrow— And if that should fail he
                            would move that the standing Committees should be discharged from the
                            further consideration of the subjects referred to them— A message was
                            received from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> in answer to my call for the correspondence
                            respecting the laws of South-Carolina for the imprisonment of coloured
                            Seamen— He says he is not aware of any decision by <persRef ref="johnson-william">judge William Johnson</persRef>
                            that the Act of South Carolina was unconstitutional— A memorial from
                            <persRef ref="allen-thomas5">Thomas Allen</persRef>, about the printing of the census compendium was received,
                            and after much debate, referred to the Committee of Claims— A memorial
                            from <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef> and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef> on the same subject had already been referred to
                            the same committee. A report from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> also relating
                            to this knavery was this day at first referred to the Committee of the
                            whole on the state of the Union; but afterwards on my motion transferred
                            to the Committee of claims.— There was a long and ludicrous retrenchment
                            debate always made so by specifications of petty parsimonies soaring to
                            the glory of reform— The Committee propose to abolish the Office of
                            draughtsman to the house— <persRef ref="floyd-john3">J. G. Floyd</persRef> moved to add, and that of
                            Postmaster. then came all the appendages of the post office; and an
                            interminable discussion, renewed in Committee of the whole upon the
                            state of the Union, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the Chair on the general appropriation
                            Bill. Briggs decided that an amendment proposed by the chairman of the
                            ways and means was not in order, but the Committee of the whole reversed
                            his decision, and amendment crawled upon amendment till the house
                            adjourned— Evening visits from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Greenough</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">her
                                Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>— Then from <persRef ref="ferris-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ferris</persRef>, a member of
                            the house from New-York, and his friend <persRef ref="u">an American</persRef>, settled 25 years in
                            Sicily, and now on a visit to his native land—from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            he urged me to read the eightieth psalm, and to sign a petition to the

                        <p>This <persRef ref="munday-george">George H Munday</persRef>, is a religious fanatic or lunatic, who wears a
                            Russian caftan— A Mooshik’s beard, a large gilt cross hung round his
                            neck, with an inscription upon it— His conversation with me, last Night,
                            and this Morning was interrupted by other visitors, but he repeated
                            called on me to read the 80<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, which he
                            insisted was prophetic of the burning of the Pennsylvania hall— Last
                            evening he wished me to head a list of Petitioners to the <persRef ref="porter-david5">Governor of
                            Pennsylvania</persRef> for the pardon of a man under sentence of death for the
                            murder of his wife, and of a young woman for the murder of another. I
                            declined— This morning he brought me, and urged me to sign a petition to
                            the Legislature of Pennsylvania, to abolish capital punishments in that
                            Commonwealth— This I also declined. He used much incoherent reasoning to
                            convince me that man can no more forfeit than he can alienate his right
                            to life, but the last resort of his argument was the exhortation to read
                            the 80<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, as a plain prophesy of the burning
                            of the Pennsylvania Hall.— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giddings</persRef> came, and to
                            my satisfaction somewhat abridged the Munday lecture against capital
                            punishment.— He came to enquire the precise extent to which I hold the
                            subject of Slavery in the States subject to the jurisdiction of the
                            National Government—and I explained it to him— In the case of a servile
                            War, involving the free States of the Union, the question of
                            emancipation would necessarily be the issue of the conflict— All war
                            must end in peace, and peace must be concluded by Treaty— Of such a
                            Treaty, partial or universal emancipation would probly form an
                            essential, and the power of the President and Senate of the U.S. over it
                            would be co-extensive with the War— <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff</persRef> came
                            and informed me, that since his last interview with me he had received
                            advices, that the State of the Isthmus, had reunited itself with the
                            Republic of New-Grenada; where by his agency for the Independent State
                            of the Isthmus had ceased— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> and <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph

                            press— His real object being to save the Tyler job of the Madisonian. I

                        <p>In the National Intelligencer of this morning is published the Letter of
                            <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> to the general Assembly of Kentucky dated the 16<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month, and resigning his Seat in the
                            Senate of the United State to take effect from the 31<hi rend="superscript"
                                >st.</hi> of this month— This movement is preparatory to another, by
                            which the whigs in Congress are to announce him as their candidate for
                            the next Presidential election— There is in the same paper a summary of
                            the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States last week, in the
                            case of <persRef ref="prigg-edward">Prigg</persRef> against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, declaring null
                            and void an Act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and all State Laws,
                            interfering with the recovery of fugitive Slaves— <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier</persRef> went with me to the Capitol— In the
                            house the resolutions of the retrenchment Committee on the expenditures
                            of the house was immediately taken up— The sixth Resolution was to
                            charge the Postmaster with contracting for horses and mail
                            carts—adopted— The seventh charged the door keeper with the supply of
                            fuel, oil and candles, and forbidding the use of them by the
                            restorateurs attached to the house—adopted. The eighth charged the clerk
                            with the purchase and supply of stationery; and to keep accounts and a
                            record of its cost.— <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> moved an amendment directing the clerk to
                            give a preference to Articles of American Manufacture— <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef>
                            moved an amendment, provided they are equally cheap— The <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Man Mountain</persRef>
                            called the yeas and nays on this amendment of Slavery against free
                            labour, and it was carried 98 to 87.— The ninth Resolution limited the
                            supply of stationery to each member of the house to the cost of 25
                            dollars to the long and 20 to the short Session—upon which arose a storm
                            of debate—amendment was heaped upon amendment till the members scarcely
                            knew what they were about— <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of Charleston S. C moved that no
                            stationery should in future to be furnished to the members at the public
                            expense, twice taken by yeas and nays—first carried 98 to 90. then lost
                            91 to 95. The resolution was at last adopted, 160 to 22—and <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>
                            moved a reconsideration— After which, and a resolution proposed by <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D.
                            Barnard</persRef>, for the removal of the tables and desks of the members which
                            was not received, the house went into Committee of the whole <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Zadok Casey</persRef>
                            in the chair upon private bills, a great number of which were passed
                            upon and reported—to the house. Adjourned at half past 3.— I dined at
                            the President’s— A 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March, or ex-presidential
                            dinner. <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison</persRef>, <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">S. L. Gouverneur</persRef>, <persRef ref="monroe-maria">his wife</persRef> and

                        <p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe</persRef> of Boston had brought me a Letter of
                            introduction from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and had assured me of the warm interest that
                            he had taken in my recent trial, but I could then see him only for a few
                            minutes; he came again this morning with <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef>, but just then came
                            also <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Force</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Heman Lincoln</persRef>, who told me that the Trustees of the Columbian College
                            had made provision for paying off their debt to me, now, if I would
                            receive in payment certain securities to be made equivalent to specie—
                            This places me under the no small inconvenience of losing the interest
                            of the money until I can reinvest it at one of the worst times I ever
                            knew for such an operation— Virginia bank bills, now at a discount of 7
                            per cent, and sinking from day to day; a promisory Note of <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Obadiah B.
                            Brown</persRef>, and other most slippery funds are all that they can offer, and
                            yet most of the subscriptions from which their payments must be made are
                            conditional that the whole debt shall be paid off to-morrow— <persRef ref="rothwell-andrew">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Rothwell</persRef> the Treasurer of the Trustees came to me
                            at the House, but I could not make the settlement with me there He
                            agreed to come to my house at 7. O’Clock this evening, but did not come.
                            <persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth Pierce</persRef> came to say that <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">judge Underwood</persRef> thought it would be
                            most advisable not to call up this day the bill for the relief of her
                            Sister <persRef ref="telfair-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Telfair</persRef> and her; but to let it wait to
                            come up in its turn, for a better chance to escape debate— <persRef ref="boardman-william">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Boardman</persRef> of New-Haven came and introduced to me,
                            one of his constituents by the name of <persRef ref="u">Fletcher</persRef>— At the house, the
                            Resolution to meet on and after next Monday at 11. O’Clock A.M. was
                            after much debate reconsidered, and that hour was fixed for the first
                            Monday in April, and after that day— A long debate then followed on the
                            resolutions of the retrenchment Committee; regulating the distribution
                            of stationery to the members of the house and to the Committees— <persRef ref="snyder-john">Snyder</persRef>
                            moved to reduce the pay of the members to five dollars a day, and the
                            mileage to 2 dollars for every 20 miles— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> ruled this
                            amendment out of order— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> moved that no more boxes should be
                            furnished to members for packing up and sending home their books—
                            Boardman moved to extend the interdict to tin cases for maps and
                            charts—which Arnold accepted as a modification of his amendment— The
                            debate wore down the patience till after three or four successive
                            motions to adjourn, it was finally carried about 4.— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>I rode to the Capitol, leaving <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >rs</hi> Angier</persRef> at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Greenough’s</persRef>, going to the
                            Unitarian Church. In the hall of the house of Representatives, I heard
                            <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin</persRef> preach from Romans 5.9. [“]Much more

                            through him”—a common calvinistic. A very small auditory—not half the
                            seats of the members filled. But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin gave
                            notice that he should preach every Sunday morning during the Session of
                            Congress in that hall—he afterwards said there would be preaching in the

                            newspapers— The omission of newspaper notification I suppose is to save
                            Tustin the mortification of preaching to empty seats while crowds will

                            Tennessee— Gilmer said that he had received a copy of this Letter from a
                            total stranger to him; he believed lately a Senator from the same State
                            of Tennessee; not only with permission but with a request that he would
                            use it—and accordingly he sent it to the clerk’s table and an extract
                            from it was read— This farce appearing to make no impression upon the
                            house, the next Morning <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> produced and held up the Letter itself, and
                            had the same extract read again, with as little effect as before— This
                            evening I received a Letter from <persRef ref="anderson-james4">J. Anderson</persRef> in Tennessee stating that
                            he is the Executor of his fathers Will, but has not yet obtained
                            possession of his papers— That the production of my Letter by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer was utterly disapproved by him, and that he
                            had learnt the fact with grief, mortification and deep indignation— So
                            that this piece of treachery recoils upon the traitor, and is of no
                            avail to Wise or Gilmer.</p>

                        <p><persRef ref="wilcocks-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilcocks</persRef> called upon me this morning and informed
                            me that he was an applicant for the appointment of Chargé d’Affaires in
                            China— He said he considered the War between Great Britain and China as
                            substantially finished— That after the capture of Amoy, there was
                            nothing to prevent the approach of the British invading army to Pekin;
                            and that must necessarily bring the Emperor of China <persRef ref="daoguang">Taou Kwang</persRef> to terms
                            such as the British should please to prescribe— That under such
                            circumstances it would be culpable neglect on the part of our Government
                            not to have an agent on the spot to watch and guard our own interests,
                            and that he must be invested with a diplomatic character, no consular
                            power being adequate to the emergency— I fully concurred in this
                            opinion; but not in the confidence that the War is already terminated,
                            or that the British would be able to dictate their own terms or that
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilcocks would be the most suitable person
                            for the mission— He was many years Consult at Canton, the memory of
                            which would be no recommendation of him to the Chinese; and he is too
                            old and infirm, for a mission which requires above all things youth, and
                            vigilance, and active exertion.— At the house, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> present a tabular
                            statement of two rates of apportionment for representation under the new

                            no State would lose a member; and the other a ratio of 70,000 to form a
                            house of 217 members—ordered to be printed— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef>, chairman of the
                            general retrenchment Committee presented a report in part concluding
                            with a Resolution authorising the Committee to sit during the Sessions
                            of the house, and to send for and examine persons and papers; which was
                            adopted The Resolutions reported by <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers’s</persRef> retrenchment Committee on
                            the expenses of the house were resumed—the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and

                            definitive conclusion.— Then the general appropriation Bill, brought up
                            again questions of retrenchment. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> offered a Resolution, for the

                            were spirited from removing the desks and tables from before the seats
                            of the members—reform rages like a consuming fire— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> objected to

                        <p><persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> came to my seat in the house yesterday morning and told me that
                            he had received a Letter from his particular friend <persRef ref="anderson-alexander">General Alexander
                                Anderson</persRef>, late a Senator from Tennessee denying the statement made by <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">T.
                                    W. Gilmer</persRef> that he had received from him my Letter to <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Joseph Anderson</persRef>,
                            which Gilmer read in the house—declaring that he utterly disapproved of
                            the disclosure of that Letter, and requesting Pickens to publish his
                            explicit denial of the fact that he had furnished my Letter, in the
                            National Intelligencer and the Globe; which Pickens said he would
                            immediately do. Accordingly the Letter from Alexander Anderson to
                            Pickens, and one from Pickens to the editors of both papers requesting
                            them to publish it appeared in both papers of this day. <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef>,
                            asked me yesterday to head a list for a dinner to be given to <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi

                            declined, as being superannuated for all public dinners— He said the

                            ask for an exposition of their principles.— <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef> the reporter
                            brought me yesterday a hen’s egg, from the farm of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            inscribed on its shell.— He asked me to show it as a curiosity to the

                            adopted— Numerous reports from Committees were received, and two

                            the state of the Union— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the Chair; upon amendments proposed in

                            contingencies— In 1837—I had obtained the insertion among the rules of
                            the house one, that no expenditure should be provided for in a general
                            appropriation Bill, not authorised by Law— But the very next year an
                            exception was added to the rule for contingencies, and for the
                            continuance of works authorized by law, and from that hour the rule has
                            been a dead Letter, and I had given up as desperate, all attempt to
                            enforce it— Some days since <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> of Tennessee moved to strike out of
                            this bill, all items of appropriation not otherwise authorised by
                            existing Law—thus falling back on my principle. This motion after much
                            debate was carried by a large majority, but it has entangled the house
                            in a snarl from which they will find it difficult to extricate
                            themselves— In the item of contingent expenditure in the Department of

                            requiring the job—printing to be done by contract with the lowest
                            bidder, and <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett</persRef> Davis moved an amendment that the Laws should be
                            published in the Newspapers having the largest circulation— This was a

                            subscribers and kept alive only by the patronage of printing for the
                            public offices— This was the stimulant of <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> furious onset upon

                        <p><persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> called this morning, and told me that as
                            there appeared to be at present an interval of leisure from discussions
                            of much interest to the cause of liberty he proposed to avail himself of
                            it, to pay a visit to his family. The Intelligencer of this morning
                            contains the Letter of <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Joshua R. Giddings</persRef> to the Legislature of Ohio, in
                            answer to their infamous factious resolutions of censure upon me for
                            presenting the Haverhill Petition— In the House <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> offered a
                            Resolution for a select Committee of five to consider and report upon
                            the expediency and propriety of separating the patronage of the
                            Government from the private and political press and on the best mode of
                            effecting that purpose adopted without opposition— So was a Resolution
                            offered by <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef>, instructing the judiciary Committee to
                            enquiry into the expediency of reporting a bill for selecting juries in
                            States where obstacles are interposed by the local laws. Committee of

                            Appropriation Bill— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> moved to strike out the item of appropriation
                            for the Salary of the first Auditor of the Treasury and his clerks—
                            <persRef ref="miller-jesse">Jesse Miller</persRef> of Pennsylvania is the Auditor; and in the report of Wise’s
                            Committee of investigation, into the <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel">Swartwout</persRef> defalcation, Miller was
                            charged with culpable negligence and incompetency; in not discovering
                            Swartwouts embezzlements— Stanly modified his motion, to strike out only
                            the auditor’s own salary and sent to the clerk a speech of <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit’s</persRef>
                            made two years ago, vehemently denouncing the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> administration
                            for retaining Miller in office. A ludicrous debate now followed, between
                            Proffit—<persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef>, Wise, and <persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef>; succeeded by <persRef ref="floyd-john3">John G.

                            Proffit boasted that his speech had elected half the whigs in the house,
                            and Charles Brown said <persRef ref="ogle-charles">Ogle’s</persRef> speech had elected the other half.— <persRef ref="linn-archibald">Linn</persRef>
                            of New-York finally took the floor; the Committee rose, and the house
                            adjourned— <persRef ref="cruit-robert">Cruit</persRef> was here with his claim, and <persRef ref="rothwell-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Rothwell</persRef> brought me a mortgage of <persRef ref="brown-obadiah">Obadiah B Brown</persRef>, as security for the

                            College; which he left with me, to be called for in the course of the
                            next week to complete the final settlement of that concern— Evening

                            the Senate still linger about taking up and passing upon the nomination
                            of him as a chaplain in the Navy of the United States. He intimated a
                            suspicion of two causes as throwing obstacles in his way—one was that 
                            <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef> had nominated with him another
                            personal, relation of his own, for the same office, and the other that
                            an undue proportion of episcopalians were appointed to these
                            chaplaincies.— <persRef ref="pitchlyme-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitchlyme</persRef> is a Choctaw Indian—a

                            educated that he delivers public lectures here: he came to complain of
                            abuses practised in the application of the annuities and pension funds
                            to which his tribe are entitled by the Treaties, and Laws, and to
                            request the exercise of my influence in their favour— There was also a

                            of Kentucky offered a Resolution instructing the Committee of Ways and
                            Means to enquire into the expediency of increasing the duties upon
                            wines, silks, linens and luxuries generally to twenty per cent ad
                            valorem, and twenty percent more annually, imported from countries
                            levying a heavy duty on tobacco, imported from the United States, until
                            they shall reduce their duties to the level of our Standard— <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
                                Cooper</persRef> enquired if it was in order— <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> objected to its
                            reception— Green moved a suspension of the rules; failed, and his
                            resolution was not received— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> obtained leave to offer from the
                            Committee of Ways and Means sundry amendments to the loan bill, which
                            were laid on the table, and ordered to be printed. The order of the day
                            was on the question of printing a report from the judiciary Committee
                            against a supplement to the Bankrupt Law to include corporations— But
                            <persRef ref="roosevelt-james">Roosevelt</persRef> yielded the floor and private business was taken up— 50 bills
                            passed to be engrossed. 30. house bills passed— 6 Senate bills passed,
                            and 10 bills laid aside for debate— The house adjourned before 3.

                            made the prayer; and <persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke</persRef> preached from Luke
                            15.10— “There is joy in the presence of the angels of God, over one
                            sinner that repenteth.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clarke observed that
                            the existence of Angels, ministering Spirits was a fact revealed to us
                            in the holy scriptures; and of which there is no other evidence— He
                            referred to several passages of the old and new covenant in which these
                            mysterious persons are mentioned and some of them are named— But he did
                            not enter deeply into the subject, nor descant upon the War in Heaven,
                            by which one third of this celestial hierarchy rebelled against the Lord
                            God omnipotent.— Matter for meditation— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had sent an invitation
                            to <persRef ref="dickens-charles;dickens-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickens</persRef> to dine
                            with us this day at half past two— They were engaged to dine with <persRef ref="greenhow-robert">M<hi

                            answered that they would come and take their lunch with us at our dining
                            hour— They came accordingly— I had invited <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef>, <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef>, <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> to meet them—and <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>— <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> had also promised
                            to come, but was detained by the arrival of some of his friends from
                            New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickens
                            left us about 4. O’Clock.— They are so beset with civilities, and kind
                            attentions, that they have not a moment of time to spare, and it was
                            only by snatching an hour from other engagements that they could see us
                            at all— Dickens’s fame has been acquired, by sundry novels and popular
                            tales published in England under the name of Boz—republished in this
                            country in many newspapers, and more universally read perhaps than any
                            other writer who ever put pen to paper— He came out in the January
                            steamer to Boston, and his reception has transcended that of <persRef ref="lafayette">La-Fayette</persRef>

                        <p><persRef ref="bartlett-edwin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwin Bartlett</persRef> came this morning, and mentioned
                            that he had a claim upon the Government for services as acting Chargé
                            d’Affaires in Peru for two years while he was Consult at Lima, and there
                            was no official diplomatic agent there; and he spoke of the important
                            services which he rendered during that period; and solicited my
                            influence to obtain the allowance— Then visits from <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Granger</persRef> and <persRef ref="hone-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip Hone</persRef>; and
                            afterwards three delegates from the Merchants of New-York, <persRef ref="aspinwall-william2">Aspinwall</persRef>,
                            <persRef ref="newbold-cleayton">Newbold</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Fitch</persRef>, to represent the disreputable and discredited State
                            of the Government and Country—and to urge the action of Congress to
                            redeem the credit of the Nation— They said that the Notes and
                            engagements of the country have been protested at New-York, and are at a
                            discount of 1 1/2 per cent— At the house, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef>, from the
                            Committee on the judiciary reported a Bill to provide for the selection
                            and return of jurors for the courts of the United States where they have
                            not been able to conform the designation and empannelling in substance
                            to the local laws and usage—this bill of deeper import in its bearing
                            upon the laws of the States than the house was aware of; was driven
                            through, with out discussion, by the suspension of the rules, and by
                            three several previous questions— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> presented petitions for
                            the repeal of the Bankrupt Law; and moved their reference to the
                            judiciary Committee with instructions to report forthwith a bill to
                            suspend the operation of the act till the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
                            March next— <persRef ref="chittenden-thomas">Chittendan</persRef> moved to lay the motion on the table—lost 89. to
                            96—previous question called lost—81 to 87. no second, and the motion
                            lies over for debate— <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> presented a petition, praying as an
                            alternative the rescinding of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule or the
                            dissolution of the Union— Not received— Barnard presented a Petition,
                            for the dissolution of the Union, and moves its reference to a select
                            Committee with instructions to report adversely to its prayer. Question
                            upon reception— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> proposes to debate, it lays over. Dinner at

                            only—indisposed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shepperd was authorised to
                            report to the house the Senate Bill for paying out from the Treasury,
                            commissions to the agents and attornies of claimants, under the French

                            diplomatic missions abroad was taken up, and read— Cushing started an
                            objection to the consideration of the subject, denying the right of the
                            Committee to consider any thing not referred to them by the house— I
                            then moved that the chairman be instructed to move in the house the
                            reference to the Committee again of the Resolution of 29 August last,
                            proposing a reduction of the diplomatic missions abroad, upon which the
                            Committee make no report at the extra Session— Cushing’s objection was
                            overruled—supported only by his own vote. The instruction was given, and
                            I made the motion in the house; immediately after the reading of the
                            Journal— Cushing objected— I moved a suspension of the rules to enable
                            me to make the motion— Cushing cavilled and quibbled upon the points of
                            order, which the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> decided against him— He called the motion for
                            reference a Report, and argued that no Committee could report upon any
                            thing not referred to them by the house— <persRef ref="yorke-thomas">Yorke</persRef> moved the previous

                            Dickens had on Sunday requested of me an autograph, which I had
                            promised. I wrote it last evening, and directed it to Baltimore—but it

                            next at 10. A.M— In the house Fillmore moves to postpone the further

                            adopted— Cushing then offered a written Resolution that in future the
                            proceedings of the Committee should be conducted so far as practicable
                            by the rules of the house— This produced another debate consuming all
                            the remnant of time till the meeting of the house, Granger voting at
                            last with Cushing, and all the other members present against his
                            Resolution— When the Committee adjourned, I asked Cushing what motive he
                            had for this course of proceeding with me; and found him sore upon
                            trifles lighter than air, for pretexts but really, because I am chairman
                            of the Committee, and because I exposed the tampering of the Slave trade
                            majority of the Committee, with him, which he himself had made known to
                            me. He has got himself into trouble, and makes desperate plunges to get
                            out of it— In the house, <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> wanted some notice in the journal of
                            yesterday of the manner in which the Committee of the whole on the state
                            of the Union laid aside the General Appropriation Bill, and took up the
                            loan Bill; but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said the journal never took notice of any

                        <p><date>18. V:30. </date>Friday.</p>
                        <p>I have invested the remnant of the sum received in payment of the
                            Columbian College bond, in 6 per cent Washington city corporation stock,
                            2000 dollars of which were sold at auction last Monday, and purchased
                            for me by <persRef ref="nourse-charles2">Charles J. Nourse</persRef> at 92 1/2 per cent payable in Virginia bank
                            paper at a discount of 7 per cent for specie. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Nourse charging 1/2 of 1. per cent or 10 dollars for brokerage— I paid
                            1000 dollars in the draught of <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">Heman Lincoln</persRef>, in favour of <persRef ref="chapin-stephen">S. Chapin</persRef>, on
                            the Merchant’s Bank at Boston— 200 dollars in Virginia and Philadelphia
                            Bank Notes, and 536. dollars in a check on the Bank of the Metropolis
                            upon a deposit of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker White’s</persRef> order of 500 dollars furnished me
                            last Tuesday and one of the same amount before, of which there still
                            remained a balance of 200 dollars in the bank— I had yesterday offered
                            the Speaker’s last check of 500 dollars, to Major Nourse, towards the
                            balance of payment for the corporation stock, and claimed the premium of
                            7 percent on it as specie— Nourse declined allowing more than 5 per cent
                            agio upon it saying that the Speaker’s draughts were paid in Treasury
                            Notes on which the current discount was 2 1/2 percent— So I took back my
                            Speaker’s check, deposited it this morning in the Metropolis bank, and
                            asked if they would pay it in their own bills— <persRef ref="smith-richard">Richard Smith</persRef> the Cashier
                            declined; saying that they paid specie for their own Bills—but their
                            only public funds were treasury notes, which were at a discount of 2 1/2
                            percent— I then called again at Nourse’s office and offered him a check
                            of 536 dollars on the Bank of the Metropolis, for the balance of specie
                            due for the corporation stock, and told him that if the depretiation of
                            2 1/2 per-cent had taken place since the sale of the Stock last Monday,
                            I could not be responsible for it, and if he declined taking my check as
                            specie, I must cancel the bargain and demand repayment of what I had
                            paid— He then took my check for specie and promised to send me the
                            certificates in the course of the day— Instead of which, he sent me an
                            order of <persRef ref="corcoranandriggs">Corcoran Riggs</persRef> upon <persRef ref="u">Wiltberger</persRef> the City register for the
                            Stock.— I called on the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>, and left with him a copy of
                            the Resolution of the house of 29. August 1841. looking to a reduction
                            of the number of the diplomatic missions abroad—and the tabular
                            statement of specific deductions proposed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster manifested a very warm disposition for
                            economy and rentrenchment in the abstract, but an equally warm aversion
                            to any specific reduction— After sufficient conversation with him to
                            ascertain his propensities, I told him I should in the course of the
                            day, address a Letter to him <pb n="83" type="ms"/>referring to the
                            Resolution of the House and requesting in behalf of the Committee of
                            Foreign Affairs, his views upon the subject, as early as he could
                            conveniently make it, that it might be in time for consideration on the
                            passage of the general appropriation bill— I spoke to him also, about a
                            claim of allowance of a charge in an account of <persRef ref="porter-david">David Porter</persRef>, Minister
                            Resident at Constantinople; which he himself had referred to the
                            Committee of foreign affairs, but of which he evidently knew nothing;
                            and I mentioned to him information I had received of an angry
                            correspondence between the British Consult and ours upon a charge
                            against a Captain of an American vessel of having sold at the Havana,
                            three coloured Seamen, whom he had ship’d at the Cape de Verd Islands,
                            as freemen.— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Webster conveyed to me ambiguously
                            the idea that this was entirely new information to him, and that he knew
                            nothing about it— I saw clearly that he did know, what he did not chuse
                            to tell me— He said he had received yesterday despatches from our Consul
                            at the Havana <persRef ref="calhoun-james4">James S. Calhoun</persRef>, but had not yet read them. He took up a
                            Letter upon his table, and read in silence some part of it, and then
                            laid it down, and said nothing— He sent me back this evening the
                            Resolution of the house, and H. Everett’s tabular statement; and I sent
                            him the Letter requesting his views for the consideration of the
                            Committee— At the house— <persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplett</persRef> moved a call upon the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the

                            the board of Navy Commissioners.— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi made an
                            indignation sally against <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> of New-York, for presenting last Monday
                            a petition to Congress, to assume the debt of the State of Mississippi
                            and to eject that State from the Union.— Morgan slip’d it in, without
                            exciting the notice of the Slave holding members, and Thompson and <persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef>
                            the representatives from the State only discovered it by the Newspapers.

                        <p>I took the order of <persRef ref="corcoranandriggs">Corcoran Riggs</persRef> this morning to the City Hall— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Wiltberger</persRef> the Register was there, and kept me
                            upwards of an hour, making out four certificates of Corporation 6 per
                            cent Stock, amounting to 2000 dollars, which he delivered to me.— The
                            Mayor, <persRef ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef> was not at his office, and Wiltberger told me would
                            not be there this day. The Meeting of the Committee on the Smithsonian
                            bequest was fixed for 10 this morning, but it was 11. when I reached the
                            chamber of the Committee and found there, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-truman">Truman
                                Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="randall-benjamin">Benjamin Randall</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>— Absent <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>, <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef>. Of my tardiness, I failed not to be reminded— We took up the
                            old bill, and debated it from the third to the sixth Section inclusive.
                            Every provision, of every section was contested; and the only sound
                            principle settled was that the principal sum of the bequest should be
                            preserved unimpaired as a perpetual fund, from which no appropriation
                            shall be made— Habersham of Georgia opposed the parts of the Bill
                            providing for the establishment of an Astronomical Observatory— His
                            argument was the danger and difficulty of carrying it through Congress—
                            And he said that only yesterday one of the members from the South urged
                            in conversation with him that Congress had no constitutional power to
                            accept the bequest, and that the money ought to be sent back to England.
                            I saw the finger of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C. Calhoun</persRef> and of nullification; and said that
                            the objection against the power of Congress to accept the bequest would
                            not be removed, by striking out the observatory— That M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Calhoun and his co-adjutors had urged it from the beginning
                            and it had been time after time settled against them— That any
                            application of the fund to the purposes of the testator would be
                            resisted by them, and if any thing was to be done it must be carried
                            against their stubborn opposition. Adjourned to Monday Morning at 10.
                            H.R. Debate on <persRef ref="mason-john10">John T. Mason’s</persRef> motion to reconsider the rejection of a
                            bill for the relief of the legal representatives of <persRef ref="eppes-john">Francis
                            Eppes</persRef>—refused 82 to 90. Underwood urges to take up and pass upon the
                            Senate’s amendment to the District Bank Bill—fails.— Several Executive
                            Communications and Bills from the Senate read and referred— Private
                            business set aside for Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,

                            Presidential election— This morning I went with <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
                                Angier</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> to the Capitol, where, being rather
                            belated, we found <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef> preaching to a crowded
                            auditory from Luke 24.27. “And beginning at <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and all the prophets
                            he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning
                            himself.”— This was the second of three Sermons, the first of which he
                            had delivered last Sunday, and the third of which he promised for the
                            next, on the union of the divine and the human nature in the person of
                            Jesus Christ— He kept up the interest, and rivetted the attention of his
                            auditory through the whole discourse— There is extreme apparent
                            earnestness in his manner, but I cannot escape from the impression, that
                            he believes not a word of what he says.— He assumed that the whole bible
                            from the first chapter of Genesis to the last of the apocalypse has
                            continual reference to the double nature, the divine and the human
                            character of Jesus Christ— He marked the coincidence between the
                            creation of light in the first chapter of Genesis, and the resurrection
                            of <persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> by Jesus; the very moment after the manifestation of humanity
                            by weeping at the grave of Lazarus— One of the quaint remarks of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt was that when Jesus rose from the
                            Sepulchre, he left a napkin behind to wipe away the tears from the eyes
                            of his faithful disciples.— After dinner I went to S<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t.</hi> John’s Church and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read
                            the Evening service for the Sunday before Easter, or Palm Sunday, and
                            preach from Matthew 11.29—“learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
                            heart: and ye shall find rest unto your Souls.—[”] After church I went
                            to <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> and spent a couple of hours in

                        <p>Meeting of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest at 10. A.M— I was
                            punctual to the minute but waited more than half an hour for a quorum.
                            Present Adams, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-truman">Truman Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, <persRef ref="habersham-richard">B. Randall</persRef> and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.

                            of the old Bill, from the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section through—
                            Every one had amendments to propose, and the bill was thoroughly
                            riddled— Many amendments were adopted, and I was directed to prepare an
                            amended bill for the consideration of the Committee, at the adjournment,
                            Wednesday Morning— <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                            Angier</persRef> had departed in the Cars for Baltimore at 6. O’Clock this
                            morning, for home at Medford— On the adjournment of the Committee I
                            found the house in Session— <persRef ref="brown-milton">Milton Brown</persRef> reported from the Committee—I
                            found the house in Session—Milton Brown reported from the Committee on
                            the judiciary a bill, respecting the U.S. District Court in
                            West-Tennessee, which passed through all its stages without examination
                            or opposition— <persRef ref="cross-edward">Cross</persRef> of Arkansas then offered a Bill to give to the
                            District Court in that State the powers of the Circuit Court, on the
                            avowed ground, that the judge of the Supreme Court within whose Circuit
                            that State is situated never has attended there; and Cross said he
                            deserved to be, and ought to be impeached. I thought this no sufficient
                            reason for increasing the jurisdiction of the District judge, but I
                            reluctantly consented to the introduction of the bill, that it might be
                            referred to the judiciary Committee. The question upon <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly’s</persRef>
                            Resolution, giving the house power by a majority to take at discretion
                            any bill out of the Committee of the whole, after several attempts to
                            evade it, was finally carried 105 to 98— In the call for Resolutions,
                            <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky moved an inquiry of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> and heads of
                            Departments for the names of all the members of Congress who have
                            applied for offices by themselves or their friends, of the 25<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> or 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congresses; and
                            specifying the office applied for in each case— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio offered
                            a series of resolutions relating to Slavery and the Creole case— <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef>,
                            moved the previous question. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> moved to lay them on the table—lost
                            by yeas and nays 52 to 128— Everett moved a call of the house—refused—
                            After much turbulence and confusion, Giddings withdrew the Resolutions.
                            <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> then moved a suspension of the rules to offer a Preamble and
                            Resolution of censure upon Giddings, yeas 128. Nays 68. Not two thirds.
                            <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> of Ohio then offered the same resolution it being still the turn
                            of the State, and he moved the previous question— The question whether
                            Giddings should be heard in his defence was unsettled at the
                            adjournment.</p>

                            going to the Capitol, and said he wished to have some conversation for
                            which I proposed to him to come at 7 this evening I attended the meeting
                            of the Committee of foreign affairs; all the members present except <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Meriwether</persRef>— I reported the substance of the verbal

                            evening, and to which I have not yet received an answer.— I told them
                            that he did not think it expedient to diminish any of the missions at
                            the present time, though he thought there might hereafter be an
                            improvement of the system by uniting several missions in on person— The

                            Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain was taken up, partly considered and

                            resolution of censure was actually passed by yeas and nays 125 to 69—
                            And then the preamble was adopted 119 to 66— I can find no language to
                            express my feelings at the consummation of this act— Immediately after
                            the second vote Giddings rose from his seat, came over to mine; shook
                            cordially my hand; and took leave— I had a voice only to say—I hope we
                            shall soon have you back again. He made no reply, but passed to the
                            seats of other members his friends, and took leave of them as he had
                            done of me— I saw him shake hands with <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>, who voted against him. He
                            then left the house, and this evening the City— The house then refused
                            to adjourn, and went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union upon the loan bill till they failed of a quorum, when the
                            Committee rose and the house adjourned.— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

                        <p>Just as I was going out this morning to attend the Smithsonian Committee,
                            <persRef ref="dorr-eben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorr</persRef> came in, and detained me for at least
                            one hour, with a statement of his wishes, and prospects of an
                            appointment as Chargé d’Affaires at Buenos Ayres— He read to me, and
                            left with me a recommendation of such an agency. Signed by the
                            Presidents of many insurance companies and other merchants in Boston,
                            New-York Philadelphia and Baltimore; and also an exposition of the
                            rupture of ten years standing between the Governments of the United
                            States, and of the Argentine Republic, on account of the invasion by
                            <persRef ref="duncan-silas">Captain Duncan</persRef>, and of the Falkland Island in 1831. I still reached the
                            Committee room at 10 O’Clock— Present Adams, <persRef ref="randall-benjamin">Randall</persRef>, <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-truman">T.

                            The remainder of the old bill was thoroughly debated and additional
                            amendments were proposed. I was finally directed to prepare a Bill and
                            then call a meeting of the Committee— In the house, upwards of two hours
                            were consumed in debating sundry amendments proposed to the journal of
                            the proceedings of yesterday—among the rest, my appeal from the decision
                            of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> that the previous question, cut off from <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Giddings</persRef> his right of self defence, was not noticed on the
                            journal, though it was correctly reported in the National Intelligencer
                            of this morning— I moved an amendment of the Journal stating the fact of
                            the Speaker’s denying my apppeal— I called the yeas and nays which were
                            42 to 110. but the facts are now stated on the journal of this day— The
                            other motions to amend the journal were laid on the table <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> withdrew
                            his proposed amendment stating the fact that he had refused to vote on
                            the resolution of censure. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> offered a resolution that 5000 copies
                            of the proceedings of the house in relation to the resolutions offered
                            by Giddings should be printed for the use of the house. Laid on the
                            table. Everett asked to be allowed to explain his censure of
                            Giddings—not allowed— The Speaker presented a Letter from Joshua R.
                            Giddings resigning his Seat in the house. I moved that the Speaker
                            notify the Executive of the State of Ohio, of the vacancy occasioned by
                            this resignation, which he said should be done— Committee of the whole

                        <p>During my trial of the last week in January, and the first in February,
                            the pressure upon my time for my defence was so incessant, night and
                            day, that this diary, by an overruling necessity ran thirteen days in
                            arrear— This has often happened to me before, and when the breach to
                            such an extent has been made it has often become irreparable between the
                            effort and the failure to recover the continuity of my record, by the
                            stern chase of Time— I have on this occasion, and on some others, taken
                            the precaution to make from day to day some loose minutes, from which
                            the thread of my narrative has been preserved entire from the 31<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January to the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            instant, inclusive— They will be found among my loose papers— This
                            morning the whole arrear has been first redeemed. I am now afflicted
                            with a pimple eruption in the centre of my left eyebrow, which threatens
                            again my power to write; and yet critical days are again coming upon
                            which the thread of my remaining destiny upon earth will hang by the
                            Spider’s most attenuated thread— This morning a man by the name of <persRef ref="neal-william">Neal</persRef>
                            came, and said that he was returning from Virginia, where he had been to
                            recover the effects of a friend who had died there; but had failed to
                            obtain any part of them and had been personally insulted and abused,
                            because he had been taken for an abolitionist— He said he had got thus
                            far on his way home, and had not money left to carry him to
                            Philadelphia— I lent him a ten dollar Virginia bill, which he promised
                            should be repaid before next Monday night— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Davis</persRef> a mendicant friar came with contribution books for building a
                            church some where in New-Jersey.— I did not subscribe—another Methodist
                            divine, named <persRef ref="u">Holmes</persRef> sent <persRef ref="u">his son</persRef>, with a subscription list, for a
                            History of the great awakening by Whitfield, which I also declined— At
                            the house, some heaving of the billows after the storm remained— I moved
                            a suspension of the rules to enable me to offer a resolution to add a
                            new rule, that no accused member should by the operation of the previous
                            question or of any other rule be deprived of the right of being heard in
                            his defence— The vote to suspend the rules was 99 to 77.— In Committee
                            of the whole on the state of the Union, the loan bill was debated but
                            not reported to the house—dull balderdash of <persRef ref="colquitt-walter">Colquitt</persRef> and <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
                                Cooper</persRef>—and sharp-shooting between <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F Marshall</persRef>
                            took the floor, Committee rose and the house adjourned. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p><persRef ref="everett-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> presented to me, yesterday a paper signed
                            by several members requesting a meeting of the whig members from the
                            non-slave-holding States, at 10 this morning in the chamber of the
                            committee of foreign Affairs— I declined signing the call, acknowledging
                            no party communion with whigs of the slave representation; but I said I
                            would attend the meeting— I went accordingly to the chamber of the
                            Committee precisely at 10 this morning, and found there, M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Everett, who informed me, that the meeting was postponed for
                            a few days at the special request of the whig delegation from Ohio—and
                            thus ends this project of a meeting— I remained in the chamber till the
                            meeting of the house intending to finish the draft of the Bill for the
                            consideration of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest; but several
                            members successively came in to attend the proposed meeting, and
                            <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> first, and afterwards <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> stop’d and held some conversation
                            with me. Granger believes there is dissension among the members of the
                            administration, and there is a rumour to that effect in circulation— I
                            made little progress in the draft of the Bill, but found the house in
                            Session. <persRef ref="morris-calvary">Calvary Morris</persRef> of Ohio, had offered Resolutions censuring the
                            proceedings of the house in their censure of <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>, but could not
                            obtain even the yeas and nays upon his motion to suspend the rules—
                            <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> offered a resolution to suspend the engraving of a map of the
                            boundary-line between the United States and Texas to have the work done,
                            by the engraver for the Senate and carried that Resolution— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> also
                            obtained a suspension of the rules and carried the resolution of enquiry
                            which he has been several days pressing. <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> offered a Resolution
                            to cease debate on the loan bill in committee, and to take it into the
                            house next Wednesday at 2. O’Clock.—carried 114 to 76— Private business
                            superseded, for Committee of the whole upon the state Union, <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> in the
                            chair— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> made a long premeditated speech in defence of the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, of which he is a member against the charges
                            of <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>— While he was speaking a message came in from the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
                            recommending the repeal of the land bill, and a revision of the tariff;
                            when Marshall finished Wise took the floor and for an hour and a half
                            poured out a flood of abuse upon Fillmore; reserving Marshall for
                            to-morrow— The Committee rose about half past 4 and the house adjourned—

                        <p><persRef ref="sprague-seth2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprague</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robbins</persRef> called
                            on me this morning, and said they were desirous of having some
                            conversation, concerning the duties on cordage to be fixed on the
                            revisal of the Tariff. But the conversation immediately became general
                            concerning the present aspect of affairs in Congress and in the Country,
                            which is deplorable. I told them that Slavery, the support the
                            perpetuation, and the propagation of Slavery was at the root of the
                            whole system of policy of the present administration— That an essential
                            part of this system was hostility to the manufactures, and to the free
                            labour of the North— That this Spirit, in alliance with the mock
                            democracy of the free States exercises now absolute controul over the
                            majority of both houses of Congress, and if unable to carry all its
                            purposes into execution now, will at least defeat every measure which
                            could contribute to promote the manufacturing interest or the domestic
                            industry of free labour— Of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprague’s opinions I
                            had been partially apprized, and from his disclosure of them at this
                            interview, I perceive that his visit to Washington at this time has
                            other objects in view besides the duty upon cordage— <persRef ref="uzielli-r">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Uzzielli</persRef> is an Italian philosophical traveller from Leghorn,
                            who last Summer brought me a letter of introduction from <persRef ref="tocqueville-alexis">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> De Tocqueville</persRef> at Paris, and who now brought me one from
                            <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> dated the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month at
                            New-Orleans— Since the summer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Uzzielli has
                            travelled over a great part of the United States, and he proposes to
                            complete his tour, so as to return to Europe next July. He appears
                            sensible and candid, and I had a free confidential conversation with him
                            on our present financial and political condition— I went with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth
                                C. Adams</persRef> to the city Hall, where <persRef ref="hall-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David A. Hall</persRef>
                            took her acknowledgment of a Deed of some stock in the Boston South cove
                            corporation, which <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> had sent her in blank. I then left her at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Greenough’s</persRef> door and repaired to the Capitol— It
                            was one of the days devoted by the rules of the house to private
                            business, but they went into Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union, <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> in the Chair, on the loan-bill. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> resumed the floor, and
                            delivered four hours and a half of unmeasured bitter, rancorous
                            invective upon <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>, Marshall, and the whole body of the manifesto
                            whigs—he was suffered to go on without call <unclear>to</unclear> order, and with scarce
                            a word of interruption, till just upon 5 when he sat down, and at least
                            30 members started up— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> gave the floor to <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef>. The
                            Committee rose, and the house adjourned—</p>

                        <p>Easter Sunday— Clear, cool, bright, sunshine with all the elements of
                            physical nature attempered as if for the enjoyment of human life, to
                            contrast with the dark, gloomy, tempestuous and terrific aspect of the
                            moral and political world— I went with my daughter <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Catherine</persRef>, her
                            daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, and my niece <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>, to the Capitol
                            where we heard the chaplain of the house <persRef ref="maffitt-john">Maffitt</persRef> preach the third of
                            four successive Sermons, on the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ—
                            His text this morning was Romans 9.5. “Whose are the fathers, and of
                            whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed
                            for ever. Amen.” The reading should be “blessed be God forever—” and it
                            is upon equivocations like this, that rests all the scriptural authority
                            for deifying Jesus of Nazareth— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt’s
                            discourse like that of the last Sunday was ingenious; eloquent,
                            sagacious in the selection of his authorities from the Testaments old
                            and new.— He seemed to make a deep impression on his auditory, 9.10<hi
                                rend="superscript">ths.</hi> of whom were already believers of his creed;
                            but he acknowledged he had nothing new to say in support of his
                            doctrine, he acknowledged that it had no support of evidence, except
                            from the scriptures, and he adduced no testimony that I had not seen and
                            heard before— And since I read <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> sermon on the same subject
                            thirty years bygone, I have been inaccessible to any argument to gain
                            the belief of that which he had failed to establish— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Maffitt announced that he should preach his fourth and
                            concluding sermon on this subject next Sunday— The floor of the house
                            was crowded almost to choaking; but there were few persons in the
                            galleries— I walked home and stop’d at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>, <persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef>
                            hotel’s to enquire for <persRef ref="sprague-seth2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seth Sprague jun<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> for whom I had received last evening a Letter
                            from <persRef ref="loud-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob H. Loud</persRef> at Plymouth—but he lodged at
                            neither of those houses— <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>. In the afternoon
                            at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
                            read the evening service for Easter Sunday, and preached from Ezekiel
                            34:16. [“]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
                            was driven away, and will bind up, that which was broken, and will
                            strengthen, that which was: but I will destroy the fat and the strong: I
                            will feed them with judgment.” Call at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef>
                            after church; but he was riding out—</p>

                            took leave of me—having at last received his commission, and about
                            departing for New-York, there to await orders— He expressed his
                            gratitude to me, for my assistance in obtaining his commission, and said
                            he should make it his earnest endeavour by his conduct to prove himself
                            worthy of the interest I had taken in his favour.— Then came <persRef ref="walley-samuel">M<hi

                            Walley is a very active politician in Massachusetts; was sometime
                            Speaker of the House of Representatives at the late Session of the
                            Massachusetts Legislature, and has now some commission from <persRef ref="davis-john4">Governor
                            Davis</persRef> to urge the recovery here of the Massachusetts claim— These visits
                            detained me, all the morning til the time came for attending the house.
                            <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> went with me to the Capitol, and then to <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge

                            visited the gallery of the house— It was the day for the reception of
                            Petitions, but <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved to go into Committee of the whole on the
                            state of the Union upon the loan-bill, which was carried by yeas and
                            nays 122 to 53.— <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> of Tennessee had the floor from Saturday; and
                            replied in a speech of two hours to <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>— He was followed by another two
                            hours speech of <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef>, of North-Carolina— The floor was then taken by
                            <persRef ref="colquitt-walter">Colquitt</persRef> of Georgia at whose motion the Committee rose by a vote of 62
                            to 59 above quorum.— <persRef ref="lane-henry">Lane</persRef> of Indiana then announced his desire to speak,
                            and Colquitt consented to let him have the floor for the remnant of this
                            day; reserving it for himself to-morrow So the house went into Committee
                            again <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> in the Chair and Lane made his speech of about an hour And it

                        <p>A young German physician named <persRef ref="bremer-edward">Bremer</persRef> came this morning, and whispered in
                            my ear, that he wished to speak a few words with me. <persRef ref="hellen-mary;adams-elizabeth">Mary and Elizabeth</persRef>
                            were in the room, and immediately retired. The secret that he had to
                            reveal to me was that he with <persRef ref="u">a wife</persRef> and two children were starving for
                            want of bread; and he himself for want of employment— In search of this
                            he had come two years since from Germany, and resided chiefly at
                            Philadelphia— He was a Hanoverian—had studied physic at the University
                            of Gottigen, and had lived some part of his time by teaching.— He had
                            been reduced to the necessity of selling his library, and even as much
                            of his cloathing as he could spare with decency.— He could spare no
                            more, and his wants were bread and employment.— It is melancholy to
                            think to how many unfortunates even in this country a precisely similar
                            tale applies; and deeply distressing to me, that I have power to afford
                            them no permanent relief. I attended at 10 this morning the meeting of
                            the Committee of foreign Affairs; all the members present except <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Meriwether</persRef>; but two or three were belated an hour
                            or more, and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> came in as the Committee were about to adjourn— The
                            resolution of enquiry into the expediency of reducing the number of
                            diplomatic missions abroad, was considered— No answer had been received
                            from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> to my Letter of enquiry and some sensibility
                            was manifested at the delay— <persRef ref="everett-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> said that
                            with the verbal information from me, of the aversion of the Secretary of
                            State to any reduction, he should not press the further consideration of
                            his tabular statement, nor mark any one particular mission, for
                            suppression; but he moved that the chairman be directed to prepare a
                            report to the house upon the resolution to be submitted to the
                            consideration of the Committee; which was adopted— There was some
                            conversation upon the claims of <persRef ref="porter-david">David Porter</persRef> and <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef>, but no
                            action. In the house there was adopted at my motion a resolution for the
                            sending of all petitions to the Clerk’s table, to be disposed of by the
                            <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef>; and all admissible under the rule to be referred to the
                            appropriate Committees— Committee of the whole, on the state of the
                            Union, <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> in the chair upon the loan-bill Colquitt—<persRef ref="shields-benjamin">Shields</persRef>—<persRef ref="smith-william14">William

                            O’Clock <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> took the floor.— The Committee rose and the house
                            adjourned— I came home and found <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> here. Her brother <persRef ref="cutts-richard2">Richard</persRef>
                            came in afterwards— He had been this Evening at the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> house,
                            and found <persRef ref="tyler-robert">Robert Tyler</persRef> in profound admiration of Caleb Cushing’s

                        <p><persRef ref="brent-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Brent</persRef> called on me this morning, and as
                            the legal representative of his deceased brother <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, who died
                            Consul of the United States at Paris, mentioned that he had a claim for
                            extra diplomatic services during a period of 12 Months, while there was
                            no minister of the United States in France; that is from the return of
                            <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef> home till the appointment of <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef> and his
                            arrival at Paris— He asked my advice what he should do for the
                            prosecution of this claim, and I said I knew of no other course than to
                            present a memorial to Congress setting forth the claim, accompanied with
                            the vouchers in its support— He said he would prepare the Memorial and
                            requested me to present it, which I readily promised to do.— I called at
                            the Treasury Department, wishing to see the Secretary, <persRef ref="forward-walter">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Forward</persRef>; but he was sick, and not there— I enquired of
                            <persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M’Clintock Young</persRef> the Chief Clerk, concerning the resolution of the house
                            adopted at my motion at the extra Session last Summer, calling for a
                            report from the Secretary of the Treasury, on the debts of the States—
                            He said that there were several of the States from which no answers have
                            yet been received. There are probably several from which no returns will
                            be received— The report then is not to be expected soon— But he shewed
                            me tabular statements of the debts of several of the States from which
                            answers have been received— I spoke to him also of the appointment of a
                            Surveyor of the customs at Boston and requested that it might not be
                            made on a recommendation of mine made before the death of <persRef ref="harrison-william">President
                            Harrison</persRef>. I then proceeded to the pension Office, and left with the
                            <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner Edwards</persRef> a Letter requesting the return of a certificate of
                            marriage of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Heston</persRef> deposited there as a
                            voucher for an unsuccessful claim to a pension— He will report to me
                            concerning it— Call at the Headquarters of the Commander in chief of the
                            army— <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> himself is gone to New-York— The adjutant general
                            <persRef ref="jones-roger">Roger Jones</persRef> opened the Letter, from <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> which I left with
                            him—soliciting the discharge of a poor thief and deserter imprisoned for
                            trial— At the Office of the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef>.— Left there the
                            application of <persRef ref="hedge-isaac2">Isaac Little Hedge jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> of Plymouth
                            for a warrant of Cadet at the West-Point Academy, and requested that his
                            name might be entered on the books of the Department as a Candidate
                            promised but with warning of no hope of success.— At the house Committee
                            of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef> in the chair on the
                            loan-Bill— <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> occupied the floor from 12 to 2 with snarling
                            sophistication repeated by rote from <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Woodbury</persRef>. The chairman’s hammer
                            then knocked him down— Two hours were consumed in the rejection of silly
                            captious amendments and the bill was reported to the house. After a
                            short exposition from <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> moved the previous

                        <p>Time presses heavily upon me— I receive an average of 8 Letters every day
                            of which I am unable to answer at least 7. and of which it is no light
                            task even to keep an assorted file— The little leisure of this morning
                            was consumed in commencing an alphabetical file for the month, now
                            closed— I called at the General Post-Office, and delivered to <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe</persRef>, the petition for a granite post-office
                            at Quincy, which I received some days since, from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son</persRef>; and of which
                            <persRef ref="spear-justin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Justin Spear</persRef> is proposed to be the
                            Postmaster— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe said there was no instance
                            of the establishment of a new Post-Office in Country towns, within 3
                            miles of another—that the usual rule was 5 miles—and I told him that the
                            distance of the Post-Office at Quincy from the quarries is less than two
                            miles— I read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe the Letter from <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Loring</persRef>, recommending <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                    Whiton</persRef>, and that from <persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">Jotham Lincoln</persRef>; recommending <persRef ref="lincoln-rufus">Rufus Lincoln</persRef> as
                            Postmaster at Hingham— He sent for the recommendations received at the
                            Office, of which there were 26. for Whiton 52 for Lincoln, and 50 for
                            <persRef ref="hobart-joseph">Joseph Hobart</persRef>. He said he should suspend his decision upon the
                            appointment for a few days— <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ambrose Spencer</persRef> came
                            in while I was there.— At the house the reports of sundry Committees
                            were received among which are from <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">L. Saltonstall</persRef>, chairman of the
                            Committee of Manufactures, with a Tariff bill; which was read twice;
                            referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and
                            ordered to be printed—with the report counter report and documents and
                            5000 extra-copies— <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, and <persRef ref="brown-aaron">A. V. Brown</persRef>, make the minority report—
                            Then <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford’s</persRef> call of the house came up and 196. members answered—
                            Previous question on the engrossment of the land-bill. The principal
                            amendment reported by the Committee, authorizing the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the
                            Treasury</persRef> to sell the stock of the loan under par was lost by yeas and
                            nays 97 to 99. The other amendments were carried, by majorities of 8 or
                            more— Before the vote on the engrossment of the bill was taken, two of
                            the whigs who had voted against the vital amendment were rallied back to
                            their party, and then there was a whimsical perplexity how they should
                            reverse their own decision— They were compelled first to pass the
                            engrossment—then to reconsider that, then to reconsider the vote
                            rejecting the amendment and then to adopt the amendment by 99 to 97. two
                            votes changing the majority—the bill finally passed 103 to<space/>Sundry
                            executive communications were received. Arnold moved a reconsideration
                            of the vote passing the bill to prevent its being successfully made on
                            the other side, and it was rejected— Adjourned at 4. <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>
