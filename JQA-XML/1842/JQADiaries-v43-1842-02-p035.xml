						<p><persRef ref="thompson-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> called on me this morning to speak of the
							joint Commission of claims upon Mexico; and of his apprehension of
							failing to obtain indemnity for his claim— But this is a subject to
							which it is impossible for me now to give suitable attention— Meeting at
							10 this morning of the Committee of Foreign Affairs— I presented a paper
							stating that <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Thomas W. Gilmer</persRef>, a Member of the house from Virginia, and
							a member of the Committee, having announced in the house, his intention
							to move without instructions from the house, to elect a chairman <pb
								n="36" type="ms"/>the present chairman now enquired whether he was
							ready to make that motion, and moved that this enquiry, together with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer’s answer thereto should be entered on
							the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee— After some shuffling
							conversation, Gilmer wrote an answer, that he was ready to vote against
							me— I objected that this was no answer to the enquiry, since he could
							not vote against me without a motion made and no other person had
							manifested a purpose to make the motion whereupon after more dodging he
							finally added that he was ready to make the motion— I requested that the
							minutes of the Committee might henceforth be kept by another member, and
							<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> undertook it. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> moved to lay the whole subject on the
							table— Everett, Cushing, <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> and <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> voted ay. Gilmer, <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="johnson-william2">Cost Johnson</persRef> and <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>, and I voted no.— and upon my motion to enter
							my enquiry and motion and Gilmer’s answer upon the minutes the ayes were
							Hunter, Proffit, Rhett and myself, and the noes Everett, Granger,
							Johnson and Cushing— I then called upon Gilmer to make his motion; but
							the time of the meeting of the house had arrived: and Everett moved the
							Committee to adjourn to the usual time this day week, which was carried—
							The house met at 12. O’Clock, but transacted no business.— A few minutes
							after notice was given that the Senate were ready for the ceremony; and
							the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> and <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk of the House</persRef> preceded by the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Serjeant at arms</persRef>, and
							followed by the members two and two marched into the Senate chamber
							where Seats were provided for as many as could be accommodated. I walked
							with <persRef ref="russell-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russel</persRef> a new member from Pennsylvania, and
							stood in the middle aisle, while the religious solemnities were
							performed.— <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef> of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania had occupied a
							Senators chair, left it for me; but I declined taking it, and afterward,
							<persRef ref="archer-william">W. S. Archer</persRef>, a Senator from Virginia came and took it. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tustin the Chaplain of the Senate made a prayer and <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef> the Chaplain of the house delivered a
							rambling short discourse— The procession was then formed and walked to
							the depot of the Railway Cars, about starting for Baltimore. I then
							returned to the house and thence home and at 5 went and dined at <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Seaton’s</persRef> with <persRef ref="howard-george2">Lord Morpeth</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							<persRef ref="gamble-roger">Gamble</persRef> of Georgia, asked leave to present Resolutions of the Legislature
							of that State, concerning the establishment of certain Post-roads— I
							said, as I had said last week to <persRef ref="cross-edward">Cross</persRef> of Arkansas, that I would readily
							consent to the House’s taking up for consideration, their Resolutions,
							provided they would at the same time take up and pass upon those I had
							offered, calling upon the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> and two of the Executive Departments
							for information essential to my defence— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> considered this, as
							an objection to the reception of Gamble’s motion, and called up my trial
							as the order of the day— I then demanded the action of the house upon my
							Resolutions of call— Gilmer writhed and wriggled, and moved to lay my
							first Resolution on the table— <persRef ref="jones-isaac">Jones</persRef> of Maryland moved to lay the whole
							subject on the table which I resisted and was rejected by yeas and nays
							89 to 112. <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-william14">Smith</persRef> of Virginia and <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> opposed the
							call, but it was carried 107 to 96. as was the second 95 to 84. The
							third at the motion of <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> was laid on the table to 64— I entered
							upon my defence. <persRef ref="summers-george">Sommers</persRef> moved an Amendment to Marshall’s amendment of
							Gilmer’s Resolution of censure.— Sommers’s amendment was to refer the
							whole subject to a select committee He moved the previous question but
							withdrew it at the earnest importunity of Gilmer, who was teeming with a
							Speech against me— He spoke accordingly about an hour, and then upon a
							motion of <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef>, the house adjourned. I dined with <persRef ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy</persRef> and

						<p><persRef ref="ratcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff</persRef> called on me this morning, and read to me
							the answer he had received from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>, to his
							application as the agent and in behalf of the Republic of the Isthmus—
							It is procrastinative, and argues soundly the necessity of delay before
							recognizing as an Independent State, a part of an extensive country with
							which we are in friendly relations. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratcliff
							seemed earnestly inclined to press for the interposition of our
							government to mediate for the final separation of the State of the
							Isthmus from New Grenada, but I dissuaded him from that; and advised him
							to wait patiently for the result of the informal mission to the Isthmus
							contemplated by <persRef ref="tyler-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef>— At the house my Resolution
							calling for <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">A. Stevenson’s</persRef> correspondence with <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef>,
							inadvertently overlooked yesterday, was taken up, and at my motion
							adopted without a division— <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> consumed nearly two hours in his long
							meditated and bitterly rancorous speech against me—when he closed,
							<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> started up, but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said I was entitled to the floor in
							my own defence. I spoke accordingly about an hour and a half; and
							brought to light the conspiracy among the Southern Members of the
							Committee of foreign Affairs to displace me as Chairman, and to elect
							Cushing in my stead— I produced the anonymous Letter from Jackson N.C.
							20 Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1842. threatening me with assassination; and
							the engraved portrait of me, with the mark of a rifle ball on the
							forehead, with the motto to stop the music of John Quincy Adams 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> President of the United States</p> 
							<lg><l>who in the space of one revolving moon</l>
								<l>Is statesman, poet, babbler and buffoon—</l></lg>
						<p>These were Gilmer’s own words excepting the word fiddler which his echo
							changed to babbler— I produced also, and read the minutes of the
							proceedings in the Committee of foreign Affairs— I reviewed my relations
							with the Virginian Presidents of the United States heretofore
							<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef>, <persRef ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>, <persRef ref="monroe-james">Monroe</persRef>, and contrasted them with this
							base conspiracy of three Virginians banded here, together with numerous
							accomplices in and out of the house for my destruction. Near four
							O’Clock, I closed for the day, with an apt quotation from <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Moore’s</persRef> Love’s
							of the Angels, and came home very much exhausted. </p>

						<p> I occupied the whole of this day in continuing my defence before the

							with my colleague <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> by the offer to choose him chairman of the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs in my place— He denied it positively, and
							called upon Cushing as positively to deny it; which with no small
							blustering he did— I then called upon Cushing to say who it was that had
							made the overture to him, which after some shuffling he declined to do,
							upon the pretence of not revealing private conversation but <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R. B. Rhett</persRef>
							was forced to come out and acknowledge that <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							was the man, who on the same day when Gilmer gave notice in the house
							that he should move in Committee to chuse another Chairman, went to
							Cushing, and told him that they would elect him chairman in my place.
							Cushing repelled the advance, and said he would not serve, and intreated
							<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> to dissuade them from the attempt which he did for two days,
							without success— After bringing out all this, I returned to the
							Haverhill petition—and to the external conspiracy against me. To the
							Gilmer and <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> Resolutions of Censure, and the intervening Southern
							Caucus, I brought out <persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplett</persRef> to acknowledge that he called the
							Caucus.— Marshall that his resolutions had been submitted to them, and
							that there were forty members and more at the Caucus— I paid my tribute
							of thanks to <persRef ref="warren-lott">Lot Warren</persRef> of Georgia for his manly Declaration yesterday,
							that he would give no countenance whatever to these proceedings against
							me, and I returned with warm acknowledgments the kindness of the members
							from Kentucky, Maryland and Virginia who have refused to join in this
							conspiracy against me, and I charged the Newspapers of this City and
							District, with injustice to me; the Globe being daily filled with abuse,
							and invective upon me, while I am here on my trial; and the reporters of
							the intelligencer, suppressing the most essential parts of my defence— I
							specially refuted the pretence that the Union could be dissolved only by
							force, and cited the example of the peaceable dissolution of the
							confederation Union, by the present Constitution of the United States—
							Adjourned after 3.— <persRef ref="whittemore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittemore</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>—

						<p>No report of my yesterday’s speech in the National Intelligencer; but a
							blustering Notification that as I have chosen to complain of their
							reporters, they will report no more, without my own authority.— This is
							a mere subterfuge, to suppress the publication of my defence, and the
							exposure which I made of the conspiracy in and out of the house against
							me— I read the paragraph in this morning’s Intelligencer merely stating
							that I had continued my defence, and the sturdy notification that would
							report nothing further, unless furnished by myself, and I commented
							freely upon them, as proof demonstrative of the servile submission of
							the Press in this District to the Slave tyranny of the South— And I
							requested a postponement of further proceedings on my trial till next
							Thursday week for time to receive answers to my calls on the executive
							Departments, and to prepare for my defence so that it may be reported
							without delay— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall</persRef> made a bitter and spiteful speech against the
							postponements, and Arnold moved the previous question upon the
							Resolutions— I saw that would cut me off from all further defence, and
							preferred going on at once— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> at my request withdrew his motion for
							the previous question— I withdrew mine for postponement and proceeded. I
							was not well prepared; having expected that there would be no opposition
							to my motion for a postponement; but I found no lack of matter for
							discourse till the motion between 3. and 4. for adjournment which was
							carried— My last missile upon Marshall, was an exquisite blast upon
							Slavery, by himself in his pamphlet Letters to the Commonwealth
							Newspaper in Kentucky; which pamphlet he himself had given me some weeks
							since. He writhed under it in agony.— Before I had read the extract half
							through <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef> started up on a point of order on the old
							pretence that I had no right to discuss the subject of Slavery— The
							<persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> ruled the point against him— He appealed and demanded the yeas
							and nays which were refused, and the decision of the speaker sustained
							97 to 25— I saw my cause was gained and Marshall was sprawling in his
							own compost— I came home scarcely able to crawl up to my chamber, but
							with the sound of Io triumphe! ringing in my ear— <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Doctor Frye</persRef> dined with
							<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> was here this Evening— Marshall sent to me and
							demanded the return of his pamphlet.</p>

							Ephesians 3.17. [“]That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: that
							ye being rooted and grounded in love, 18. may be able to comprehend with
							all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth and height; 19 and
							to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be

								>t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers
							for the Sunday before Lent, and preached from Matthew 13.47. “Again: The
							Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net, that was cast into the Sea, and
							gathered of every kind.” My attention, morning and afternoon
							involuntarily wandered from the preachers and their discourses to the
							critical nature of my own position, confident of my deliverance from
							this particular assault upon me, so senseless, that its malignity merges
							by its stupidity, not into innocence but into harmlessness, but always
							distrustful of my own controul over my own Spirit— One hundred members
							of the house, represent Slaves, four fifths of whom would crucify me, if
							their votes could erect the cross.— forty members representatives of the
							free in the league of Slavery and mock democracy, would break me on the
							wheel if their votes or wishes could turn it round— And four fifths of
							the other hundred and twenty are either so cold or so lukewarm, that
							they are ready to desert me at the very first scintillation of
							indiscretion on my part.— The only formidable danger with which I am
							beset is that of my own temper— We had numerous visitors this evening
							among whom was <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General Jesup</persRef>, who came to ask Letters of recommendation
							for <persRef ref="jesup-ann">his wife’s</persRef> brother <persRef ref="croghan-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croghan</persRef>, who is going to

							<persRef ref="schenley-mary">daughter</persRef> an heiress of two millions of dollars has just eloped and whom
							she has married— She is but 14 years of age, and he enticed her from a
							boarding school.— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef> came, with a manuscript
							report by the reporters of the National Intelligencer of my speech of
							yesterday for my revisal— They sent it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barnard, supposing that after their sally against me, I might possibly
							not incline to receive it directly from themselves. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Barnard told me that intimations had been very distinctly
							given to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> that their treatment of me could not be
							tolerated at the North, and that this was the occasion of their sending
							their reporters notes to me through him— I was up till past midnight
							revising the notes of the Friday’s debate.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="weld-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld</persRef> was here this morning with a cheering report
							of the impression of my defence of Thursday Friday and Saturday, upon
							the current of popular opinion out of the house— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dorsey</persRef>, a Stranger, brought me a document which he supposed
							might be useful to me, in my defence—and <persRef ref="reeves-robert">Robert Reeves</persRef> the Scotch
							ex-custodian of the Treasury building came and took back his manuscript
							dialogue between a Calvinist and an Arminian which he had lent me to
							read, and in which he is sure that he has definitively settled the
							knotty problem of predestination and free will— I prepared a minute of
							the outlines of the continuance and conclusion of my defence, which
							would have occupied at least a week.— But I saw on Saturday that the
							house was tired of the whole subject; and that to close it now would
							afford relief to all parties.— I went to the house therefore prepared to
							proceed; but willing to stop short and dismiss the subject from the
							consideration of the house forever— I was belated, and the house had
							been about ten minutes in session when I entered and took my Seat— Other
							business was under consideration, but the question of privilege, or my
							trial was soon called up. I then observed that having perceived on
							Saturday some impatience on the part of the House to get rid of this
							subject, and persevering in the determination not to be responsible for
							one hour of time unnecessarily consumed on this subject, if the house
							was ready to lay it on the table forever, I would acquiesce in that
							decision without requiring further time for my defence; of which I
							should need much, if required to proceed— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> then moved to lay the
							whole subject on the table forever—carried by yeas and nays 106 to 93.
							<persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> of Georgia, asked to be excused from voting because he hotly
							lusted for a vote of the severest censure upon me, but despaired of
							obtaining it— The house refused to excuse him, and he voted to lay on
							the table the whole subject. They then took in hand the Haverhill
							petition and refused to receive it 166. to 40— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>, <persRef ref="baker-osmyn">Baker</persRef>, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="hudson-charles">Hudson</persRef> voting with the majority— I then proceeded with my budget of
							which I presented nearly two hundred; till the house adjourned— Most of
							them were excluded by the rule, or laid on the table by objections to
							their reception— And thus ended the second prosecution of me, by the
							despotic process of contempt. <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> offered sundry Resolutions
							denouncing this prosecution in its true character, but they were not in
							order, nor received by the house.</p>

						<p>Occupied Night and day in revising the manuscript report of the Friday’s
							part of my defence— I had yesterday morning returned to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gales</persRef>, the first part of Friday revised which was published
							in the Intelligencer of this morning— The remainder of the day reported
							by <persRef ref="u">Niles</persRef> is so poorly done that I am obliged to write it almost entirely
							over. Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— Present Adams,
							<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>— No Quorum— No Southern Member— Of course no
							business done, though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett was ready, with his
							report on the claim of <persRef ref="meade-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Meade</persRef>— Committee
							adjourned to Tuesday next. In the House the call for petitions had
							rested yesterday at the State of Maine— <persRef ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> had presented a
							Memorial from Portland complaining of the injurious operation of the
							Convention with Great-Britain upon the navigation, shipping and
							commercial interest of Maine. He had moved its reference to the
							Committee of foreign Affairs, and that it should be printed— An attempt
							was made to refuse the printing and the decision had been cut off by the
							adjournment— The printing and the reference were now ordered, and
							Fessenden now gave notice that he would at an early day move to rescind
							the rule that excludes the reception of anti-Slavery petitions.— And
							this day closed the call for petitions which had commenced on the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January— Cushing moved a reconsideration of
							the vote yesterday refusing to receive the Haverhill petition, and
							claimed to be heard on his motion—but the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> refused to hear him—
							Cushing then claimed that the question upon receiving a petition was
							debatable; but the Speaker decided it was not— Cushing appealed from the
							decision, and called for the yeas and nays; but they were refused, and
							the decision of the Speaker was sustained— Cushing quite wrathy. A
							Resolution offered by the Committee of Manufactures, authorising them to
							take testimony on the operation of the tariff laws was debated till the
							expiration of the morning hour— Then Committee of the whole on the State
							of the Union <persRef ref="briggs-george">George N. Briggs</persRef> in the Chair— Bills of appropriation for
							the relief and protection of American Seamen abroad, and for payment of
							Pensions were reported to the house, and ordered for engrossment— The
							civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill was read through and taken up by
							Sections— I suggested to <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>, to amend the composition of the Bill,
							by striking out the numberless repetitions of words applied to different
							offices—adjourned at half past 3— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> spent the Evening with
							<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>.— And <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Belcher</persRef> read to me his Dissertation on
							the Longitude.</p>

						<p>Called twice at the National Intelligencer Office; going to and returning
							from the Capitol— About the last third part of my Friday’s speech was
							reported by a young man named <persRef ref="u">Niles</persRef> whose first manuscript I could not
							decypher, and I was obliged to write over again most of the second— I
							attended the meeting of the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest—
							Present Adams, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-truman">Smith</persRef>— Absent <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="randall-benjamin">Randall</persRef>, <persRef ref="houston-george">Houston</persRef>, <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef>— No Quorum, and nothing could be
							done— My time night and day has been and yet is so absorbed for my own
							defence that I can attend to nothing else— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith
							said that he should not be here at the next weekly meeting, being
							obliged to go home to Connecticut on business. In the house, immediately
							after the reading of the Journal, <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> sent to the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> two papers;
							one signed by himself, R. M. T. Hunter, <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R. Barnwell Rhett</persRef> and <persRef ref="proffit-george">George H.
							Proffit</persRef> asking to be excused from further service on the Committee of
							Foreign Affairs; because from recent occurrences it was doubtful whether
							the house would remove the chairman, and they were unwilling to serve
							with one in whom they had no confidence— The other paper was a Letter
							from <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> to Gilmer apologising for not attending the meeting
							of the Committee yesterday; but assuring him that if he had attended he
							would have voted for another Chairman— These papers were received
							without objection; the four fugitive members were excused from further
							service by a shout of acclamation— Cost Johnson then asked to be
							excused, and was excused in like manner— After some interloping
							business, the Speaker proposed to call the Committees for Reports, which
							was acquiesced in by the house— When he called the Committee of Foreign
							Affairs, I rose and moved that the vacancies in the Committee occasioned
							by the resignations should be filled; the Speaker said he should fill
							them on the suggestion— The Resolutions to authorise the Committee of
							Manufactures to take testimony was further debated and laid aside—the
							pension appropriation bill, and that for the relief of American Seamen
							abroad were passed— Just at the moment of adjournment a volunteer
							Speaker commenced a harangue from the circular gallery denouncing the
							wrath to come; but was soon escorted by the door-keeper, out of the
							house— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> spent the evening here.— I had sent a note on
							Monday to <persRef ref="howard-george2">Lord Morpeth</persRef> inviting him to dinner this day or tomorrow; and
							received this morning his answer; engaged every day, until his
							departure— He was a constant attendant upon my trial.</p>

						<p>Call at the Office of the National Intelligencer with the revisal of the
							Reporter’s Notes, of the close of last Friday—and with my Oration at
							Newburyport and the Jubilee of the Constitution, from which I read
							extracts— But the Letter from <persRef ref="jay-william">William Jay</persRef>, and <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall’s</persRef> pamphlet from
							which I read the extract on Saturday I cannot now obtain— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> sent them to Boston with his own report of
							my Saturdays speech for the Boston Courier. I attended the meeting of
							the Committee on the Longitude; of which <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> was the
							first Chairman; but was afterwards excused from service on the
							Committee, at his own request.— <persRef ref="boardman-william">Boardman</persRef> of New Haven then became the
							chairman; and I was appointed in the place of Ingersoll— The Committee
							consist of five Boardman, <persRef ref="keim-george">Keim</persRef>, <persRef ref="sumter-thomas2">Sumter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="aycrigg-john">Aycrigg</persRef>, and myself instead
							of Ingersoll— Boardman and Keim were the only members at the Committee
							room this morning, and Boardman was very urgent upon me to assume the
							Office of Chairman which I positively declined— We had some desultory
							conversation upon the memorial from the philosophical Society of
							Philadelphia, and agreed to meet again to-morrow morning.— In the house
							on the reading of the journal, the appointment by the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> was
							announced of <persRef ref="white-edward">Edward D. White</persRef> of Louisiana, <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Augustin H. Shepperd</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E. Holmes</persRef> of South-Carolina, <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben Chapman</persRef> of

							members of the Committee of foreign Affairs, in the place of the <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas;hunter-robert;rhett-robert;proffit-george;johnson-william2">five
							who yesterday resigned</persRef>— The Resolution authorizing the Committee of
							Manufactures to take testimony was laid on the table after a call of the
							house by yeas and nays 108 to 79.— After a long debate the Committee on
							public expenditures were authorised to employ a Clerk— Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the Chair upon the civil and
							diplomatic appropriation Bill— Another long and multifarious debate
							first on an amendment offered by <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">C. Cushing</persRef> to add 3000 dollars to the
							item of appropriations for the pay of Clerks in the Office of the Clerk
							of the house two of whom this Committee proposed to curtail because they
							were not authorised by law; and the discussion soon widened into a
							general retrenchment debate, demagogical and hypocritical, in the midst
							of which the house adjoined— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minott Thayer</persRef> was again here great part of
							the evening.</p>

						<p>There was a fire in the Night—a stable, burnt at the rear of the Theatre,
							and nearly opposite my house. The bells rung a full half hour; but I
							slept so sound that I heard nothing of it, and the first that I learnt
							of the fire was by a notice of it in the National Intelligencer.— That
							paper contains also the report of the remainder of my speech on Friday
							last— I called at the Bank of Washington, where the <persRef ref="adams-james3">Cashier</persRef> refused to
							receive Virginia bank bills, the only currency now circulating in the
							City— I had received yesterday 60 dollars of Philadelphia Bank Bills
							from <persRef ref="connell-john">J. Connell</persRef> who had received them at the Bank of North America for 3
							coupons of interest on my Cincinnati City bonds, payable 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> last— I exchanged them
							yesterday at par for Virginia bank bills, hitherto current here, which
							the Pennsylvania bills are not—but as they would not now take the
							Virginia bills in deposite at the Bank of Washington, I returned to
							<persRef ref="u">Fowler’s</persRef> Exchange-Office, and took back the Philadelphia bill, for 50
							dollars, for which he had yesterday given me a Virginia bill, which I
							now returned— I then called at the National Intelligencer Office, and
							left with <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury’s</persRef> revised notes of my

							pamphlet, <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> sent on with his report of last
							Saturday to the Boston Courier, and I cannot procure them here— I
							returned Marshall’s pamphlet on his peremptory demand, and Stansbury
							says he has been unable to obtain it from him to copy the extract that I
							read.— I was late for the meeting of the Committee on the Longitude. I
							found <persRef ref="boardman-william">Boardman</persRef> still in the Committee room— <persRef ref="aycrigg-john">Aycrigg</persRef> and <persRef ref="keim-george">Keim</persRef> had been
							there, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Belcher</persRef> with them. He was still there,
							but the Committee had adjourned.— In the house the morning hour was
							chiefly consumed in an application from the Committee of manufactures to
							be allowed to employ a clerk—defeated by two successive motions to lay
							it on the table; the first failing by a tie vote of 88 to 88. with the
							casting vote of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> against it—carried five minutes after by a
							vote of 97 to 89— Then Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Zadok Casey</persRef> in the Chair,
							and private business occupied the remainder of the day till the
							adjournment— I had a long morning visit from <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Heman Lincoln</persRef>, and a tedious evening one from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Von
							Horn</persRef>. Also a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mansfield</persRef> brought a new engraved
							portraiture of the ten Presidents grouped together— I revised the proof
							slips for to-morrow’s Intelligencer, and was up till half an hour past
							Midnight.</p>

						<p>Heavy rain all night and this morning till Noon— I went alone to the
							Capitol and heard <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Maffitt</persRef>, from Hebrews 12.1.
							[“]Wherefore, seeing we also, are compassed about with so great a cloud
							of witnesses let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
							easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
							before us.” The preacher said that this was a figure taken from the
							antient Grecian Olympic games and his discourse was a continued parallel
							between the incidental usages of the Olympic games and the race of the
							Christian. His knowledge of the Olympic games however did not appear to
							be very profound— Of the various games the foot race is that which the
							Apostle takes for his similitude to the Christian race, and the chapter
							is a fervid exhortation to the disciples to energy, perseverance and
							strenuous exertion of faith in Christ, though at the cost of every thing
							precious in life, and of life itself. It is the sequel to the preceding
							chapter in which he had defined Faith, and enumerated all the wonders
							atchieved by it from <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> down through the most renowned of his
							descendants, dwelling with agonizing emphasis upon the persecutions they
							had endured, and the cheerfulness with which they has sacrificed their
							lives in support of the Faith— The attendance in the house was very
							thin, owing to the weather; and it evidently dashed somewhat the
							vivacity of the reverend Orator. His manner is conversational,
							discursive and eccentric—frequently speaking of himself and his
							opinions— He made some allusion to a passage in the Pilgrims progress,
							and said he, I like <persRef ref="bunyan-john">Bunyan’s</persRef> Pilgrim’s progress.— He said something of
							the Roman Catholic doctrine of no salvation out of the Church— I dont
							believe a word of it! said he— He quoted a saying of <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> whom he
							called the elder Adams, and another of the late <persRef ref="wirt-william">William Wirt</persRef> whose
							daughter <persRef ref="randall-catherine">Catherine</persRef>, with her husband <persRef ref="randall-alexander">Alexander Randall</persRef> was present She
							spoke to me about the life and papers of her father, and I invited her
							to my house.— There was no church at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s this
							afternoon— I attended at the second Presbyterian, and heard <persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke</persRef> from Revelations 3.21. “To him that
							overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also
							overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne.”— I was yet too
							much absorbed with this world to pay due attention to the Sermon— This
							evening I received the Boston Courier of last Thursday the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> containing <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt’s</persRef>
							report of my speech of Saturday the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> in which
							the extracts from <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Marshall’s</persRef> pamphlet, and the Letter of <persRef ref="jay-william">Judge William

						<p><persRef ref="thayer-elijah">Elijah Thayer</persRef> is the man, who one day last week commenced a harangue from
							the circular gallery of the house of Representatives, just at the moment
							of the adjournment of the house— He came this morning and told me his
							name and began a discourse of religious insanity to which I listened
							patiently for several minutes watching to ascertain if it would come to
							any controvertible point; but it was like the pouring of water over a
							mill-dam; a cento of texts from the scriptures with awful warnings of
							coming judgments— At last I interrupted him by enquiring what was his
							age—nineteen years—whence he came? from Mendon Massachusetts—what was
							his occupation? he had been living till within a few days in <persRef ref="u">his
							father’s</persRef> house—he broke out into a rhapsody against Slavery and
							Slave-holding— I advised him to hold his tongue, and to return to his
							fathers house assuring him that if he should talk to others as he did to
							me, he would soon find himself immured within the walls of a prison— He
							said that was precisely what he expected and what he wanted. He had no
							doubt he should be imprisoned; and should glory to suffer in the cause
							of righteousness.— I could not stay to hear him further, and left him to
							retire— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef> called also, and <persRef ref="cruit-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"

							<persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben Chapman</persRef> asking to be excused from serving on the Committee of

							them— They were excused by a silent vote, and I moved that their places
							should be supplied, which the Speaker said should be done. The remainder
							of the day was occupied by the call of the States for petitions;
							beginning with the territory of Ioway and proceeding South and East, to
							Maine—they were all called through— I presented all that I had left
							except the three for the dissolution of the Union, which I gave notice

						<p><date>15. V:30. </date>Tuesday.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willian S. Smith</persRef> left the City this morning and
							went to Philadelphia— In the National Intelligencer of this morning, I
							found the Letters from <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef>, <persRef ref="holmes-isaac">Isaac E. Holmes</persRef>, and <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Reuben
							Chapman</persRef>, asking to be excused from serving on the Committee of foreign
							Affairs, and the two former were so insulting personally to me, that
							they are unquestionably breaches of privilege, and I confidently believe
							that the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> would have refused to receive or present them had they
							referred to any other man in the house: certainly not without giving
							notice to the inculpated member and to the house of the accusatory
							character of the Letters— I was very strongly inclined to make it a
							point of privilege in the house to vindicate my own character— I had
							given notice to Holmes and Chapman on Saturday of the Meeting of the
							Committee this morning—neither of them had hinted his intention to ask
							to be excused— At the meeting this morning, the six members in function
							were all present—but as there were three vacancies, it was agreed to
							postpone till the next meeting the regular business of the Committee, I
							read the Letters of Mark A. Cooper and Holmes and said I considered them
							gross breaches of privilege, and had serious thought of denouncing them
							to the house— But <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> said it would be giving them an
							importance, which the writers earnestly desired, while without such
							notice they would be as they were, universally despised— <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="white-edward">Edward T. White</persRef>, thought the Letters insidiously aimed more against them
							than against me; by the principle assumed that <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
							Southern man could in honour consent to serve with me.— I determined
							therefore to sacrifice again my personal feelings for the sake of Peace,
							and to take no notice of the Letters.— In the house, by perseverance in
							two several attempts, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee on the
							District of Columbia, obtained the passage of a bill extending the time
							during which the District Banks shall be authorised to receive in
							deposit, and pay out Virginia and Maryland Bank-Bills, a year longer—
							<persRef ref="summers-george">Summers’s</persRef> select Committee Retrenchment report was debated on a
							Resolution to curtail two of the twelve under Clerks in the Clerks
							office of the house. The morning hour expired leaving this debate
							undecided— Everett gave notice that he would to morrow move a suspension
							of the rules to take up the apportionment Bill. <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef> moved that the
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, should be instructed
							to strike out of the general appropriation Bill, every item not
							authorised by an existing law, which after much debate was carried 144
							to 22— That’s my thunder, but it will be of no avail. Evening with <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef> at the Theatre— <persRef ref="u">Hill’s</persRef> benefit— <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">Angiers</persRef> at the Drawing-room.</p>

							Bank of Washington, where I left him— Committee on the Smithsonian

							from the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on the present condition of the
							funds— In the house, immediately after the reading of the journal <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Aaron
							Ward</persRef> of West Chester New-York, moved a reconsideration of the vote
							yesterday by which the Bill relating to the District Banks was passed.
							He gave no reason for his motion; and the Bill was no longer in
							possession of the house, having been taken by <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">the clerk</persRef> to the Senate.
							Ward said if the house should reconsider a Message might be sent to the
							Senate to demand the return of the Bill, to which the Speaker assented;
							but <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D. D. Barnard</persRef> appealed from his decision, and claimed to debate it—
							<persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> had moved to lay Ward’s motion for reconsideration upon

							upon his own motion for reconsideration— The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said he had not
							heard Ward’s motion for the previous question, but would entertain it
							upon his averment that he had made it— Barnard maintained that a motion
							not heard by the Speaker could not be before the house—but the Speaker
							adhered to his determination to consider Ward’s motion as before the
							house, because though not heard by him, Ward averred that he had made
							it— This previous question stifled all debate upon Barnard’s appeal from
							the decision of the Speaker to entertain Ward’s motion for
							reconsideration, because if it should prevail, a message might be sent
							to the Senate to return the Bill— Barnard withdrew his appeal, and Lewis
							Williams’s motion to lay Ward’s motion for reconsideration on the table
							by carried by yeas and nays 99 to 83. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> made another abortive
							attempt to prevail upon the house to fix a time for the consideration of
							the apportionment bill— Then came a retrenchment debate on <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers’s</persRef>
							curtailment of two Clerks, for the morning hour and the general
							appropriation bill, in the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union <persRef ref="briggs-george">George N. Briggs</persRef> in the Chair— M’Keon moved to strike out the

							appealed, but the chairman’s decision was sustained— The Committee rose
							and the house adjourned— The three vacancies in the Committee of foreign

						<p><persRef ref="angier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier</persRef> rode with me this morning to the Capitol. I
							introduced him into the Library of Congress, and to the <persRef ref="meehan-john">Librarian
							Meehan</persRef>— And I went with him to the room where the Supreme Court of the
							United States were in Session— This room I re-entered with a silent
							thrill of delight; for the first time, since I was there at this time
							last year, under such an heavy pressure of responsibility, and with so
							glorious a result! I dare not trust myself with the exultation of my own
							heart on this occasion, so fearful I am of incurring the guilt of
							presumptuous vanity, for the feeling of deep humility. In the house
							after an effort of Cooper to run through a Resolution from the Committee
							on Indian affairs concerning the authority of the <persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef> to
							employ certain clerks; and further debate on the first of <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers’s</persRef>
							retrenchment Resolutions, in which <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> of New-York and <persRef ref="brown-milton">Milton Brown</persRef> of
							Tennessee consumed the time till the expiration of the morning hour—
							When <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> called for the orders of the day, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee on the currency, and the Board of Exchequer, rose and
							said he had been directed by that committee to ask to be discharged from
							the further consideration of a certain petition referred to them; and to
							report in part upon so much of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message as relates to a
							board of Exchequer; with a Bill—a Question not a little debated arose
							whether the report and bill should be read, and who should read them?
							<persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> asked what was meant by a report in part, and whether the
							Committee proposed to report further?— Cushing answered that the
							Committee meant it as a report in part, and insisted upon his right to
							read it—in which he was finally gratified.— The report was in a pompous,
							vainglorious obsequious style; but of the character of the Bill I could
							not judge upon a single reading. I heard enough of it however to satisfy
							me that I can never vote for it— <persRef ref="davis-garrett">Garrett Davis</persRef> then presented a
							Counter-report for himself, part of which was read at his demand, and
							the reading of the rest of which was dispensed with, by his consent.
							<persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> another member of the Committee, gave notice that he
							would present a minority report— The Bill and reports were then referred
							to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and 2500 copies
							extra of the Bill and three reports were ordered to be printed— J. P.
							Kennedy moved to include in this order the exchequer board report of the
							<persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>; but that was rejected. These proceedings
							consumed the day, and soon after 3. the house adjourned Scarcely a day
							passes that I am not called from my feet by northern or western members
							to introduce to me strangers their friends or constituents of whose
							names or persons, I can retain no memory, but I was this day amused as
							well as surprized when <persRef ref="steenrod-lewis">Lewis Steenrod</persRef> came to my seat and introduce one
							of his constituents from Wheeling—</p>

							proposition from <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> to take up the general Appropriation Bill—
							<persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef> had by leave reported from the Committee on Naval Affairs,
							a bill to establish additional ranks in the Navy of the United States,
							and for other purposes.— It proposes the ranks of Admirals, Vice
							Admirals, and rear Admirals, with corresponding compensations— The Bill
							was twice read, and <persRef ref="warren-lott">Lot Warren</persRef> moved to lay it on the table— But the
							yeas and nays were called; the report giving the reasons for the Bill
							was read. Warren withdrew his motion to lay it on the table, and it was
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— This
							New born passion of the South for the increase of the Navy, this
							profusion of appropriations recommended and urged by the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary</persRef>, of
							that Department is one of the most curious phenomena in our National
							History.— From <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> dry docks and gunboats, to Admirals, three
							Deckers, and War-Steamers equal to half the Navy of Great-Britain, there
							is more than a stride— There is a flying fishes leap. A number of
							private bills, were taken up and passed, after which the house went into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the Appropriation
							Bill, <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> in the chair— The retrenchment fever ran high— Fillmore,

							50000 dollars for contingent expenses of the two houses, and <persRef ref="graham-james4">Graham</persRef> of

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="naylor-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Naylor</persRef>, the predecessor
							of <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>, as one of the representatives in Congress from
							the City of Philadelphia. In the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, the
							election was furiously contested between them, and both of them were
							returned— Naylor first and the seat was finally adjudged to him— There
							was so much, not only of irregularity, but of foul corruption in that
							election, on both sides, that it would be difficult to say which was the
							worst— At the election for the present Congress, Naylor declined—and
							Ingersoll was chosen, by a majority of 1500 votes— He is one of the
							ablest, and most unprincipled men in the house. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Naylor told me he had been two or three days in the city, and was now
							about to return home, but would not go, without calling to see me. He
							left me to conjecture what the object of his visit to the city at this
							time was.— I conjectured from a somewhat dejected appearance that it was
							an unsuccessful canvass for the office vacated by the death of <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">judge
								Hopkinson</persRef>— At the second Presbyterian Church I heard <persRef ref="clark-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clark</persRef>, from John 18.36. [“]Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not
							of this world:” a prolific theme; and very remarkable, as at once,
							asserting by inference that he was the Messiah, and avoiding what must
							have been considered as treason against the government of Caesar. He
							claimed to be the monarch of the soul. His condition as under accusation
							of a capital crime was singular— Judea was a Roman Province—but the
							charge against him was for violating not the roman; but the Jewish Law—
							The condition, power and limitations of the Levitical law under the
							judges—the kings—the divided kingdoms, and the several Assyrian,
							Babylonian, Egyptian, Grecian and Roman captivities, would form a very
							interesting and curious subject of enquiry, which I shall never have
							time to prosecute. At 4. this afternoon, at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening service for
							the second Sunday in Lent, and preached from <persRef ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef> 33.11. [“]Say unto
							them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
							the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live.”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley has a great propensity for selecting his
							texts from the prophets; but his faculty of commenting upon them is not
							so conspicuous— There is more unity in the whole collection of his
							discourses than in the composition of any one of them— Long evening
							visit from <persRef ref="daveis-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Daveis</persRef> of Portland, a man of
							lively and copious conversation especially upon New-England historicals.
							I answered this evening I believe some days too late, an invitation to
							dine with the <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> whig club of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> ward of the
							city of New-York, on the anniversary of the ratification of the Treaty

						<p>During the excessive pressure upon my time during the days when I was
							upon trial, this diary ran twelve days in arrear— I took index minutes
							from day to day, and am now struggling with Herculean labour of
							recovering the back record. At the house this was the first day of the
							Session upon which the rule for the reception of resolutions was carried
							into execution— <persRef ref="allen-elisha">Allen</persRef> of Maine offered one, calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> to
							communicate to the house the present state of the negotiation of the
							North-eastern boundary, and all the correspondence relating thereto not
							heretofore communicated.— <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> of Rhode-Island, and <persRef ref="washington-william3">Washington</persRef> of
							North-Carolina offered Resolutions instructing the Committee on the
							judiciary, to consider the expediency of passing acts supplementary and
							amendatory to the bankrupt Law. <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> offered a Resolution to alter the
								132<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> rule so that a majority of the house may at
							any time fix in advance on a day for discharging the Committee of the
							whole from the further consideration of any bill. This is one of three
							amended rules adopted at the last Session of Congress, the proposal of
							which for permanency has within a few days been agreed upon in a recent
							whig caucus. The tendency of them all is to abridge debate, and I
							opposed them all at the late Session— I voted for this one now believing
							it indispensable to save the waste of ti<unclear>me</unclear>, and the profligate
							factious opposition of the Slave democracy in the house to defeat all
							salutary Legislation— The adoption of the Resolution was by those same
							means defeated this day— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef>, Clifton, <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>—<persRef ref="floyd-john3">John G. Floyd</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="medill-william">Medill</persRef> baffled a constant majority of 2 or 3, by successive motions,
							to lay on the table—for a call of the house, and to adjourn, and by
							taking the yeas and nays upon every question, four or five of which were
							alternately taken, till the flagging spirits of the whigs were wearied
							and worried out and they adjourned, near four. I gave notice to all the

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. Present Adams, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>, <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-edward">Edward D. White</persRef>, <persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef>, <persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="stuart-alexander2">Alexander H. H. Stuart</persRef>, the whole reorganized Committee.— There was a
							Bill from the Senate authorizing the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to pay
							out a percentage to the Attornies and Agents of Claimants under three
							several Commissions, instituted by Treaties with Spain, France, and the
							two Sicilies, the sums awarded to whom have in whole or in part been
							retained in the Treasury for debts due by the Claimants to the United
							States— There were no papers with which to ascertain the reasons for
							this bill, which looked to me like a dip into the public treasury, to
							pay to the agents and attornies of claimants, all the money reserved to
							pay the debts of the claimants to the Treasury— Cushing said the Agents
							and Attornies had a lien upon the awards, which I said was at common
							Law, called champerty.— The further consideration of the Bill was
							postponed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett read his report upon the claim
							of <persRef ref="meade-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Margaret Meade</persRef>, in its favour, which was also
							discussed and postponed. In the house <persRef ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy’s</persRef> minority currency report
							was presented, and <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> immediately moved to adjourn, on account
							of its being <persRef ref="washington-george">Washingtons</persRef> birth day. It was carried by an unanimous
							shout.— Same in the Senate— I called at the Treasury Department, to
							enquire about the documents relating to the Smithsonian fund, promised
							me some weeks since— They were not yet ready; but the chief clerk
							promised again that they should be sent to me in two or three days— The
							Secretary M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward said he had wished to have some
							conversation with me, and was intending to call at my house, and he
							asked me to give him my free and candid opinion, upon the state of our
							public affairs; and particularly of the Treasury and the revenue.— I
							gave him very freely my opinions, and told him there were two things
							which discouraged me more than all the rest—one that the democratic
							members of the house, from Pennsylvania all sacrificed the interest of
							their State, to their political alliance with the South; and the other
							that <persRef ref="tyler-john">President Tyler’s</persRef> bosom friends in the house defeated every attempt
							to raise a revenue sufficient to meet the expenditures of the year. He
							shook his head and made no answer. I asked him if besides the twelve
							millions loan, and the five millions Treasury Notes already issued there
							would not be a further deficit to be provided for, before the close of
							the present year—he said he feared there would— I told him that there
							was but one remedy—taxation— Excise as well as impost; and the only
							alternative, bankruptcy.— There was a birth-night assembly ball this
							evening; attended by <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Angier</persRef>— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was quite indisposed— <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi

						<p>Committee on the Smithsonian bequest. Present Adams, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>,
							<persRef ref="habersham-richard">Habersham</persRef>— No Quorum. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Habersham told me he had
							received a Letter from the Gentleman who wrote the pretended petition
							signed by 28 fictitious names, from Habersham County, praying for my
							removal from the Office of Chairman of the Committee of foreign Affairs,
							who tells him, that he meant it only in sport— But as it had brought the
							members of the Georgia delegation, he felt it to be his duty to avow
							that he was the author of the paper; and that it was all a fiction— In
							the code of Slavery morality forgery is one of the ways and means for
							the defence of the peculiar-institutions— As I was going up the stairs
							to enter the house, I met one of the pages of the house, who told me
							that <persRef ref="williams-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, was lying
							at the point of death at his lodgings, <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef>—
							He died about 1. O’Clock P.M. while the house was in Session; but his
							death was not announced— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. D. Barnard</persRef> presented
							his amendment to the Exchequer board Bill reported by the Committee on
							the currency—that is to say a totally different bill—a substitute— <persRef ref="cooper-james2">James
							Cooper</persRef> moved a joint resolution, rescinding that which only two days
							ago, directed the Law Library of Congress to be removed, into a lower
							and Supreme Court room, and after some debate Cooper’s resolution was
							carried— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> moved an instruction to the Committee on the judiciary
							to consider the expediency of publishing a Stereotype-edition of the
							U.S. Laws.— <persRef ref="burnell-barker">Barker Burnell</persRef> moved a very long call on the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of
							the Navy</persRef> for documents relating to the caste of the ships in the Navy—
							Then the Resolution from the Retrenchment Committee upon which <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall</persRef> made a very sensible half an hour
							adverse speech— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> succeeded him not quite so long, on the other
							side and for the retrenchment of the two Clerks— He was followed by
							<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> in a frothy bombastical style terminating in nothing.— <persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles
							Brown</persRef> took him in the same line, and they rattled along like <unclear>tak</unclear> empty
							tin tea-kettles over heaps of stones.— The general appropriation bill
							soon came up with another retrenchment debate, in which <persRef ref="mckeon-john">M’Keon</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> took part. On coming home I learnt that <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							T. B. Johnson</persRef> had been struck yesterday with a paralytic affection, and
							was desirous of seeing me, to make his Will— I went this Evening to his

							for his will— I afterwards called at <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Tudor</persRef>, and

						<list><item>Thomas D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John M.</item></list>
						<p>I was up till past one this morning, making a draught of a Will for <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef> according to the directions which he
							gave me last evening—so far as I could understand them; for his tongue
							is much swollen, and his articulation very indistinct, though his mind
							is perfectly clear— This morning I wrote out a few words to say on the
							announcement in the house, of the decease of <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>.— I sent for
							<persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> early this morning—read to him the
							draught of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s Will that I had made—gave it
							to him to take to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, and read deliberately
							to him; minuting down on paper, any alteration or addition to it, which
							he would direct to be made— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Askins</persRef>, a claimant
							for a pension for <persRef ref="u">husband’s</persRef> services in the revolutionary War, was here;
							complaining much that her papers had been lost in the Office of the
							<persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk</persRef> of the House of Representatives.— When the house met; immediately
							after the reading of the Journal, <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef>, of North-Carolina,
							announced the death of Lewis Williams, the Father of the house, upon
							whom he pronounced a handsome eulogy, concluding with a motion for the
							usual obituary Resolutions of condolence with the family, and to attend
							the funeral to-morrow. I seconded the motion, and in a speech of about 5
							minutes expressed the sorrow that I felt at this sudden and melancholy
							bereavement— Lewis Williams was one of the best men in the house or in
							the world. I was followed by <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> who paid a feeling
							tribute to the memory of his friend. The Resolutions were then
							unanimously adopted and the house adjourned— Rayner immediately after
							came to my seat—offered me his hand—thanked me cordially for the remarks
							I had made, and made a frank and unqualified apology for the harsh
							language he used towards me, on my late trial— I told him it was all
							forgotten— <persRef ref="washington-william3">Washington</persRef>, <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef>, <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> and even <persRef ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef>—
							<persRef ref="campbell-thomas">Thomas J. Campbell</persRef> of Tennessee came and asked for a copy of my remarks,
							for a t<persRef ref="williams-thomas8">win brother</persRef> of Lewis Williams, now a judge in Campbell’s
							district—which I promised him. The <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> appointed me one of the
							Committee of Arrangements for the funeral; and the Committee met
							immediately after the adjournment of the house, in the Speaker’s
							chamber. Some arrangements were made, and the Committee agreed to meet
							there again to-morrow morning at 11. At home <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef>, brought me back the draught of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s</persRef>
							will, with minutes of the alterations and additions directed by him— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</persRef> passed the day at his house— I
							was up till midnight making the second draught of his Will.</p>

						<p>I went first this morning to <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B. Johnson’s</persRef>
							with the second draught of his Will, which I read to him and he fully
							approved, expressing an anxious wish that it might be signed and

							Committee of Arrangements for the funeral of <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> in the
							chamber of the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> of the house The Committee were <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Kenneth Rayner</persRef>

							<persRef ref="hopkins-george">George W. Hopkins</persRef>, and <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>— After being duly caparisoned

							we found his two relatives <persRef ref="williams-christopher">Christopher H. Williams</persRef> and <persRef ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L.
							Williams</persRef>, both members of the house from Tennessee— After we had waited
							there nearly an hour, the corpse was brought down from the chamber;
							taken into the street, and thence borne in procession, preceded by us,
							to the Hall of the house of Representatives, where the religious service
							was performed by <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin</persRef>, the Chaplain of the

							Cabinet—the judges of the Supreme Court and most of the members of the
							Senate were present.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin’s discourse was
							appropriate, and not ineloquent— The procession then went, and deposited
							the body in the common vault of the Congressional burying ground— I rode
							in tete a tete, and in perfect harmony with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rayner— No part of a funeral service was performed at the vault— We
							returned to the Capitol—eight or ten members of the house repaired to
							the Hall, where the Speaker took the Chair— The journal of yesterday was
							read, and the Speaker adjourned the house till to-morrow— I went
							immediately to <persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef> house, and thence to the City Hall, where
							I found him at his office— He called with me at <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Seaton’s</persRef> house, and then at the Office of the National Intelligencer.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton was there, and came with us to my

							Seaton and me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson’s house— There I

						<p>I slept, last Night in the upper chamber over that in which I write— I
							called at <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Charles J Nourse’s</persRef> Office this morning, and paid him fifty
							dollars for <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith</persRef>, for which he had no note— The money had

								>rs</hi> Smith</persRef> who received it, thought that the best application of
							it would be to the payment of this debt— At the House the question was
							finally put on the first Resolution reported by <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers</persRef> from his
							retrenchment Committee.— Its object was to curtail the number of
							subaltern clerks in the Office of the Clerk of the house from 12 to ten—
							<persRef ref="gordon-samuel">Gordon</persRef> and <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> of the house New-York democracy have been two or three
							days opposing this resolution, fearing that the discarded Clerks will be
							of the democracy— Gordon had moved an amendment authorising the
							employment of the two additional clerks; but being pressed as to the
							amount of their salaries 1500 dollars each, he modified his amendment,
							so as to reduce the salaries to 1200 dollars each— I voted against, and
							it was rejected, but I voted also against the resolution which was
							carried by yeas and nays 144 to 16.— The report from the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of
							the Navy</persRef> was received, communicating copies of the proceedings of the
							Court of Enquiry, and of the Court Martial upon <persRef ref="bolton-william">Captain Bolton</persRef>, in
							answer to the Resolution offered by me, when on my trial— They were at
							my motion ordered to lay on the table, and to be printed— A Message from
							the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> was received declining to communicate the documents
							shewing the present state of the Negotiation with Great Britain relating
							to the North-eastern boundary, called for by a Resolution of the house
							of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> There was a bill from the Committee of

							bed, but convalescent— I attended this morning public worship at the
							Capitol expecting to hear something of a funeral discourse upon the
							decease of <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>; but <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin</persRef> was the
							preacher and his text was Luke 17–32 Remember <persRef ref="lot">Lot’s</persRef> <persRef ref="lotswife">wife</persRef>— The discourse
							was of a general character and without funereal allusion. This
							injunction of Jesus to his disciples to remember Lot’s wife, was part of
							an awfully solemn admonition to them to expect and be prepared for
							persecutions, which would require the fortitude of martyrdom. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin dwelt with impressive force upon this idea
							for about three quarters of an hour arguing that although the trials of
							the Christian’s faith in conflict with the world, were no longer the
							same which they were in the life and at the death of Christ, that yet
							trials of the same Spirit, of the same excruciating severity and
							requiring the same inflexible energy and persevering resistance were
							incidental to the lot of Christians in every age, and from which there
							is no exemption for our own— Enumerating these in general terms, and
							taking care to avoid all reference to those real conflicts of which the
							guilty parties cannot bear mention to be made, he ran through the
							commonplace invectives against the peccadilloes of modern manners,
							closing every paragraph of exhortation against petty transgression by
							repeating the command—remember Lot’s wife— The House was barely filled
							with hearers. <persRef ref="dean-ezra">Ezra Dean</persRef> of Ohio sat next to me, and I enquired of him if

							<persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner</persRef> told me that <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> was also recovering. He was taken suddenly
							ill yesterday morning. <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><persRef ref="wise-henry">Henry A. Wise</persRef> publishes in the National Intelligencer of this Morning a
							long Letter to <persRef ref="graves-william2">William A Graves</persRef>, and a statement of circumstances
							attending the duel between Graves and <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef>, with the view to cast off
							the whole odium of it from himself upon <persRef ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>.— He succeeds so far
							as to show that Clay must share with him the odium, and he assumes for
							his pretext my declaration in the house, that I believed him more guilty
							of the blood of Cilley than the man who drew the trigger— My opinion was
							founded on the fact which occurred on the field, when after two shots
							had been exchanged without effect, there was a parley between Wise and
							<persRef ref="jones-george2">Jones</persRef>, the seconds then it depended upon Wise alone to command the peace
							between them. He had but to say Gentlemen, this misunderstanding arose
							from words spoken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cilley in debate, and in
							particular debate with me—in opposing a motion made by me— The parties
							have met like men of honour; and twice exposed their lives upon a
							punctilio— This matter must proceed no further— If M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cilley hesitates to resort to the privilege <unclear>of</unclear> free debate
							I am bound to take it, to save the shedding of his blood or that of my
							friend. This was his duty as Graves’s friend and as a man; instead of
							which he broke off the truce with an insult, saying that if the next
							shot did not take effect he should propose to shorten the distance.— He
							now admits that he did say so, but pleads that it was by order of
							Graves— He should have refused to obey such an order, fit only for a
							savage or a fiend.— A person by the name of <persRef ref="u">Mann</persRef> brought me a Bill for
							the last volume of <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">Hazard’s</persRef> Register.— <persRef ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier</persRef> and <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> rode with me to the Capitol
							to view the Statue of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>. Message by Miss Cutts— In the house
							Robert M’Lellan moves a call on the Secretary for a report of extra
							allowance to <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> in 1838. for removing the Cherokees. <persRef ref="campbell-william2">W. B.
							Campbell</persRef> moves to enlarge and dilute the call—rejected. Then motion to
							reconsider which I opposed—laid on the table— General Resolution finally
							adopted— Call for petitions—beginning from Iowa moving South and then
							East— <persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio, presented numerous petitions—among which one for
							a division, between Slavery and Freedom— House refuse to receive it—
							Explosion. <persRef ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy’s</persRef> mad Resolution not received—
							Pendleton’s—objected to.— He moves a suspension of the rules. Bustle—
							<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Winthrop</persRef> moves to adjourn—carried. Evening. <persRef ref="u">Barrow</persRef>, prospectus for
							pictorial illustrations of Washington’s life— <persRef ref="whitcomb-thomas">T. Whitcomb</persRef>. His friend
							from Vermont—<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamb</persRef>—<persRef ref="u">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Gerry</persRef>—<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>—here.</p>
