								Rothwell</persRef>, treasurer of the Columbian College came to
							enquire if I had executed the deed of release on the settlement of their
							debt to me. I had not, but promised to do it soon, and to send it to
							him.— <persRef ref="sessford-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sessford</persRef> came and gave me a certificate of honorary
							membership of the Perseverance fire company; with which was coupled a
							claim of 5 dollars annual contribution, which I fully believed I had
							paid ten or twelve days ago— But he said he had called for it, and for
							want of change— I had asked him to call again, which invitation I was
							obliged this day to repeat. <persRef ref="morsell-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morsell</persRef> came and made the
							annual payment of 300 dollars, upon the agreement for the purchase of my
							house but I was obliged to take in payment a due-bill certificate signed
							by <persRef ref="fitzhugh-m">M. Fitzhugh</persRef>, paying agent of the
							general land-office of 93 dollars, for his Salary for the month of March
							as a Clerk in the office; another like certificate for 100 dollars to
								<persRef ref="hungerford-henry">H. Hungerford</persRef> another
							clerk in the office, endorsed in blank by Hungerford, and 107 dollars in
							gold and silver.— The due-bills cannot be paid till the general
							appropriation bill shall have passed; and will then be paid in Treasury
							Notes, at a discount of at least 5 per cent. I called at the City Hall,
							and met <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seaton</persRef> the Mayor at the door of his Office— He told me
							that the quarterly interest on the Corporation Notes was paid at the
							Bank of Washington.— At the house, the morning hour was occupied by
							miscellaneous business by general consent without regard to the orders
							of the day. Bills from the Senate— Reports of Committees, reference of
							documents to them, and resolutions slip’d through by quiet managers,
							eluding the attention of the house. I stop’d one of these the
							establishment of two new Post-roads between Alabama and Tennessee, from
							an idea which occurred to me that I might offer as an amendment to the
							bill a section to restore the discontinued road between Plymouth and
							East Bridgewater. <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of
							Alabama came to my seat to urge me to let his bill pass— I promised to
							give no obstruction to it; but only to propose an amendment to it, if I
							should find it necessary for the restoration of a discontinued road
							Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> in
							the chair, upon private bills, many of which were laid aside to be
							reported till the Committee were obliged to rise for lack of a quorum,
							and the house adjourned at 4. Stanly reported a bill to prohibit the
							creation of new offices without Law. I had some conversation with him
							concerning— I was an hour and a half after the adjournment, preparing
							the Smithsonian fund bill— <persRef ref="dorr-eben">M<hi

						<p>I called this morning at the Bank of Washington and received 48.75. one
							quarter’s interest upon 3250 dollars, corporation six per cent stocks;
							in Virginia bank bills—which <persRef ref="adams-james3">James
								Adams</persRef>, Cashier of the Bank of Washington told me, were
							this day at a discount of 8 per cent for specie. Virginia bank bills are
							now the only currency passable in this city, except small notes of 1 and
							2 dollars, 50, 25 and 12 1/2 cents issued by individual merchants or
							brokers, who occasionally break and leave thousands of dollars of waste
							paper in their notes— At the house, the day was again devoted to private
							business, and as usual in such cases a bare quorum was present at any
							part of the day.— The Committee of the whole had risen yesterday, upon a
							motion to report a multitude of bills but leaving them in Committee for
							want of a quorum to report them— This morning the house went into
							committee of the whole for the sole purpose of reporting them— They were
							reported, and the day was consumed in carrying them through the stages
							of engrossment and enactment save one which was rejected by yeas and
							nays<space/>to<space/>This was dull pastime, and I made the experiment of doing
							something else, while the routine of private legislation was dragging
							through— I accordingly continued the draught of a Bill for the
							Smithsonian bequest Committee, with a hope to finish it on Monday; and I
							ascertained that I might with suitable industry, perform the work of two
							hours writing, in my seat, upon business other than that before the
							house every day upon which I take no part in the debate, and yet give
							all necessary attention to the current business of the house.— A day or
							two after the censure upon <persRef ref="giddings-joshua"
								>Giddings</persRef> there were in the National Intelligencer, some
							editorial remarks, disapproving the proceedings of the house in that
							case. Some days after, an Article written by <persRef ref="botts-john"
								>Botts</persRef>, signed “a Member,” justifying the action of the
							house, and complaining of the editorial comments— In the Intelligencer
							of this morning there is an article in reply to that of Botts, and
							signed “another member” so well written, that I was desirous of
							ascertaining its author— <persRef ref="gates-seth">Gates</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>, alternately charged it
							upon each other but Gates afterwards found that it was Hiland Hall—
							Another disclosure appears in the Anti-Slavery standard of 31.
							March—that <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> was
							the member of Congress, who chilled the ardour of the Massachusetts
							Legislature for my defence, by a seasonable hint that it might cloud the
							prospects of the Massachusetts claim upon which <persRef

							two men to preach the same gospel, with means and manners more different
							than those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt and of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nott— The discourse this day was
							argumentative—accumulative—figurative—progressive—full of amplification
							and of pathos—apparently extemporaneous, but deeply studied, strictly
							methodical, and repeated by heart, without notes.— A definition of the
							soul—a contrasted view of the finite and the infinite— Of Time and
							Eternity. Remarks upon the progressive nature of the Soul, from infancy
							to decrepitude and death—a perhaps, that this progress continues after

								>Cushing</persRef>— They had but one hour; for from this day forward
							the daily hour of meeting of the house is 11.— The answer of the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> to my
							Letter of enquiry was discussed— I moved that the Chairman be directed
							to report the answer itself; with the simple addition that they deem it
							inexpedient to propose any diminution of the appropriations for the
							diplomatic service of the present year.— The Committee were however not
							satisfied with this— They appeared disposed to scrutinize further, and
							to call for specific reasons for the continuance of each separate
							mission. It was finally agreed that the chairman should confer verbally
							again with the Secretary of State, and ask some explanation of apparent
							assumptions in his answer which were considered of questionable
							accuracy— Cushing observed that the increase of expenditures in the
							diplomatic department had been much less than in all the others; and
							that the suppression of diplomatic missions were not promotive of much
							economy, as they usually gave rise to a claim for diplomatic
							compensation to consuls— The Committee adjourned to meet again to-morrow

							enquire into the expediency of making an appropriation for the governor

							protection of the border people of Georgia, against the Florida Indians,
							and the United States troops— Black’s proposal was so revolting that it
							was clear he could not obtain a suspension of the rules; whereupon his

							popular, and liberal, but shrewd man, moved and carried by yeas and nays
							a suspension of the rules to offer a resolution substantially the same,

								<persRef ref="spencer-john">Secretary of War</persRef>; and lurking
							behind it a reference to the Military Committee, of the proposal to
							appropriate money for the Governor of Georgia to call out the militia.—
							I voted for the suspension of the rules, but when the resolution was
							received, I exposed Warren’s ingenuity and moved to strike out the
							second half of his Resolution which was like the two bulbs of a gooses’s

								<persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef>, <persRef ref="mason-samson"

								>Barnard</persRef> and myself took part in the debate— Cross finally
							withdrew his motion— Not long after, Thompson moved an addition of 200
							dollars to the Salary of the Marshal in Mississippi, and on taking the
							question there was found no quorum voting— It was just two O’Clock— The
							Committee rose, and reported the fact to the house. <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W. Andrews</persRef> of Kentucky, an
							honest, prejudiced hot headed man, who always moves by impulses, and
							whose wild stare always denotes excitement moved a call of the house,
							and declared that he would carry it through; and he did carry it
							through— Two hours and a half were consumed in the operation— One
							hundred and two members were reported absent after the first and second
							call of the names, the closing of the doors, and the call for excuses.—
							28 were brought in ostensibly in the custody of the <persRef
								ref="townsend-eleazar">Serjeant at Arms</persRef>.— Called to
							account for their absence, and admitted to their seats on payment of the
							marshal’s fees—most of the excuses were that they had gone home to
							dinner. 24 were excused, without payment of fees, almost all pleading
							indisposition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard moved and urged a
							suspension of all further proceedings, before the call of the members to
							account—and he made some just observations on the harshness of the whole
							proceeding; which I admitted, and said if he would move to relinquish
							all compulsive measures upon calls of the house I might vote with him.—
							But as this was the first instance in ten years since I have had a seat
							in the house, of a compulsive call at noonday, and as it had been made
							necessary by several successive days when Committees of the whole have
							been broken up and the house obliged to adjourn for want of a quorum, I
							hoped the process would be carried through—the names of the delinquent
							members would be published in the newspapers to-morrow, and I hoped
							would at least secure a quorum for the future at least through the
							middle of the day for the transaction of business— Andrews finally moved
							a resolution that all absentees who had not answered should be fined the
							amount of the Serjeant at arms’s fees—subject to the release of their
							fine on appearing hereafter and giving satisfactory reasons for their
							absence.— It was about 5. when the house adjourned.— Evening visits from

								Sprague</persRef> called on me this morning, and left with me a copy
							of a memorial to Congress from manufacturers of cordage in Massachusetts
							concerning the duties on hemp and cordage, with a statement of the price
							of Russian hemp and cordage, and of Manilla hemp— He gave me his views
							upon the proposed duties on these two articles in the tariff bill
							recently reported by <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall</persRef>, chairman of the
							Committee of manufactures— He also spoke of the omission of the joint
							Committee in the Massachusetts Legislature to report upon the resolution
							instructing them to enquire into the outrage upon me, in my recent trial
							here—he was a member of that Committee, and said that their reason for
							not reporting was that after the whole subject had been laid on the
							table here, they thought no expression of opinion there was necessary
							for my personal support, and that a strong resolution might produce
							excitement and alienation at the South, which it would be prudent to
							avoid— But that the approbation of my conduct was universal, and it was
							in contemplation to nominate me for the Office of Governor of the
							Commonwealth for the next year— I said that having nine years ago
							consented sorely against my own inclination to have my name presented as
							a candidate for the Office of Governor of Massachusetts, and a majority
							of the people having decided against me, I had no reason to expect they
							would be more favourable to me now; and should not suffer their
							suffrages to be asked for me again— Sprague told me that Saltonstall
							said to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> that he did not recollect having
							written to Massachusetts that if the Massachusetts Legislature should
							pass a Resolution countenancing me, the Massachusetts claim here would
							suffer for it— <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>An old man by the name of <persRef ref="gilpin-bernard">Gilpin</persRef>,
							from a neighbouring County of Maryland, a family connection of the
							Johnson family, called on me this morning and said he was 78 years of
							age, and was fast going to another world, and he came to take leave of
							me, as it was probably the last time he should ever see me in this. He
							talked politics after the manner of a county farmer, and without
							entering into details said that he approved of my course in congress.— I
							went to the Treasury Department, with 500 dollars of Treasury notes
							issued on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of April 1841. and payable
							after one year from the date, for which I received instead of payment a
							certificate from a clerk in the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							Auditors Office, that I have left that amount of Treasury Notes for
							reimbursement— I then went to the Department of State, where I was first
							told that the <persRef
								ref="bates-isaac;choate-rufus;evans-george2;williams-reuel">Senators
								from Massachusetts and Maine</persRef> were in conference with the
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary</persRef>. I went into the
							chamber of the chief clerk—<persRef ref="webster-fletcher">Fletcher
								Webster</persRef>, and was soon after admitted to the Secretary
							himself.— I told him that the Committee of foreign affairs wished
							something more explicit and specific, with regard to the expediency of
							discontinuing or reducing the rank of sundry particular missions abroad,
							than was contained in his last Letter to me— I said there was also some
							question in the Committee upon the principle assumed in his Letter, that
							it was to be presumed, that all estimates of appropriations proposed by
							the heads of Departments, were upon deliberation of the Executive deemed
							necessary.— That it was supposed the practice had been to make up the
							estimates of each year from the Appropriations of the preceding year,
							without special investigation of the items which might be curtailed— And
							I referred him to the case of the Missions to Sweden and Holland,
							reduced in 1818. by the paring down of the appropriations, presented by
							the estimates of the department. And I found among the books of the
							department my Letter to <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan
								Russell</persRef> of 22. May 1818. announcing the extinction of his
							mission, and his answer of 26. September 1818. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster finally told me that between this time and next
							Monday morning he would write me another Letter on the subject. This
							conference detained me so that it was within a quarter of 12. O’Clock
							when I reached the house.— I found <persRef ref="brown-milton">Milton
								Brown</persRef> of Tennessee addressing the house on a privileged
							question concerning himself.— In the debate on <persRef
								ref="summers-george">Summers’s</persRef> retrenchment Resolutions,
							Milton Brown had made a severe speech on the abuse practiced by some of
							the members of Congress in appropriating to themselves excessive
							quantities of stationery—whereupon <persRef ref="brown-charles3">Charles
								Brown</persRef> the <pb n="106" type="ms"/>Philadelphia demagogue
							told a story of an enormous mass of stationery having been left one day
							during the extra-session at his lodgings, which he had not ordered, and
							knew not whence it came; but the next day the Post-Office messenger came
							and took it, and said it had been left there by mistake, but was for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milton Brown of Tennessee— This
							sneaking and spiteful innuendo, Milton Brown had passed over without
							notice at the time—and it had not been noticed in the next days reported
							debates either in the intelligencer or the globe. But Charles had
							afterwards published his speech with all its dirty imputations in the
							globe which Milton Brown had not seen nor heard of till he received a
							few days since a Letter from one of his friends and constituents
							informing that this story was circulating all over his district, and was
							raising such an outcry against him, that it was indispensable that he
							should encounter and repel the charge— He therefore produced a
							certificate from <persRef ref="mccormick-william">M’Cormick</persRef>
							the Postmaster that the Stationery furnished him at the extra Session,
							had been unusually small, and from the messenger who had left by mistake
							at Charles Brown’s lodgings, the parcel, which had swollen so enormously
							in his narrative, consisted only of half a ream of Letter paper, without
							wafers sealing wax, or any other article— Milton Brown after thus
							disculpating himself from the charge emitted some sparks of indignation
							upon the Slander, which Charles Brown very ungraciously retracted— The
							question upon the passage of the iron war steamer bill had been taken by
							yeas and nays, and carried by 129. to 31. before I came into the house—
							The general appropriation bill then followed, and <persRef
								ref="cooper-mark">Mark A Cooper</persRef> moved to strike out the
							item of 100000 dollars for the survey of the coast—this raised something
							of a debate but the survey was now vigorously maintained, and even
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> had discovered its
							utility and importance.— There was a blow-up between <persRef
								ref="kennedy-andrew">Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana, and <persRef
								ref="holmes-isaac">Holmes</persRef> of South-Carolina, about a
							service of plate given by the corporation of the City of New-York to
								<persRef ref="gedney-thomas">Lieutenant Gedney</persRef> of the U.
							S. Navy, and another between <persRef ref="proffit-george"
								>Proffit</persRef> and Fressenden of Maine about the item of
							appropriation for the survey of the North-eastern boundary.— Past 4 the
							Committee rose, and the house adjourned— <persRef ref="dorr-eben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorr</persRef> called on me this
							Evening, and requesting two minutes of conversation with me kept me a
							full hour in discussing a project, which he had shaped into an act of
							Congress, to authorise the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							to institute an Office half diplomatic, half consular, for him to go to
							Buenos-Ayres— Evening at <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi

								Brown</persRef>, who called upon me last Evening told me that he was
							and had been from the beginning President of the suffrage party in
							Rhode-Island.— The political right of suffrage by the charter of
								<persRef ref="charles-ii">Charles the second</persRef>, which they
							have hitherto retained as a State constitution, is confined almost
							entirely to free holders.— Last autumn by an irregular popular movement
							a Convention of delegates from self constituted meetings formed and
							published a State Constitution, upon the principle of universal
							suffrage. The legislature then authorized by Law, another Convention to
							prepare a Constitution, enlarging the right of suffrage, but not making
							it universal. It was recently submitted to the people in town meetings,
							and rejected, and now, Brown says the elections under the suffrage
							party’s constitution are to be held next Monday week, after which they
							will assume the government of the State— The existing Legislature
							however have enacted a law prohibiting all further progress of this
							movement on severe penalties, and the <persRef ref="king-samuel"
								>Governor</persRef> has issued a proclamation against it— He has
							sent three Commissioners to claim the military interference of the

							yesterday with the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of

							agreed therefore to meet again on Monday morning.— Certain Resolutions
							of the Legislature bearing a hostile aspect towards Mexico, were barely
							taken up and postponed.— In the House, Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, <persRef ref="thompson-richard">Thompson</persRef>
							of Indiana in the Chair, on the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill—
							The Committee of Ways and Means, proposed for the Custom house at Boston
							50,000 dollars— The <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary’s</persRef>

								>Winthrop</persRef> had moved to add the 100000 last evening, and

							out the item of 50000 proposed by the Committee— <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia moved as an amendment
							30000 dollars for a Custom-house at Savannah—and I moved as an amendment

								<persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> public worship at the
							Capitol, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt preached his
							fourth Sermon upon the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ. His text
							was from Matthew 15.22. [“]And, behold, a woman of Canaan, came out of
							the same coasts, and cried unto him saying, Have mercy on me O Lord,
							thou son of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>; my daughter is
							grievously vexed with a devil. 23. But he answered her not a word. And
							his disciples came and besought him, saying, send her away; for she
							crieth after us. 24. But he answered and said I am not sent but unto the
							lost sheep of the house of Israel. 25. Then came she and worshipped him;
							saying Lord, help me. 26. But he answered and said, It is not meet to
							take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs. 27. And she said,
							Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their
							master’s table. 28. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman,
							great is thy faith; be it unto thee, even as thou wilt. And her daughter
							was made whole from that very hour.” This discourse was more rhapsodical
							than any one that I had heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Maffitt before.— The text bore only a very remote connection with the
							text— The miraculous healing of the sick is evidence of a divine
							mission, but not of the divinity of the performer.— He sometimes betrays
							gross and ludicrous ignorance such as saying that diamonds and pearls
							are found in the bosom of the earth. He said that the only way in which
							God could sympathise with man was by making himself a man—and then told
							a story of his once witnessing in New-Hampshire the death of an infant,
							and the bitter and as he thought culpably excessive lamentations of its
							parents, and his having within a fortnight after, lost a child of his
							own, and given himself up to lamentations more excessive than those that
							he had censured in others— He gave out to be sung one hymn, and set the
							tune, and sung another alone, and announced that he should preach again
							next Sunday morning— I walked home— Met <persRef ref="stanly-edward"

								>Saltonstall</persRef> made a handsome Speech— After dinner I went

								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the second Sunday after Easter,
							and preached from Isaiah 57.15. [“]For thus saith the high and lofty
							one, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy. I dwell in the high
							and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit,
							to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the

							where there are scarcely any harbours at all— He displayed a number of
							maps on which the places of light-houses were marked with red spots, and
							he affirmed that at some of the lighthouses, th consumption of oil was
							exnormous, owing to the fact that the keepers of the lights sold the oil
							to the supply of the neighbourhood five miles round. After rattling away
							for two hours in this style Proffit said he should hereafter make a

						<p>My Catarrhal cough has returned upon me with great severity, and has been
							troublesome the last two Nights.— I declined invitations to the
							birthright and take leave <persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> ball
							this evening and from the Russian <persRef ref="bodisko-alexander"
								>Minister Bodisco</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bodisko-harriet">his
								Lady</persRef> to dinner to-morrow.— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bodisco came to my seat yesterday and urged me so earnestly
							to come to his dinner, which he said was a compliment to <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Lord Ashburton</persRef>, that I promised him
							I would come, if I should find myself sufficiently relieved from the
							rack of my cough to be able— <persRef ref="simmons-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Simmons</persRef> one of the Senators
							from Rhode-Island came to my seat and said it was reported that <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J. Pearce</persRef> was in this City and
							had called on me, and enquired if it was true— I told him that I had not
							seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce, and did not know whether he
							was or had been in the city or not. Meeting of the Committee of foreign
							Affairs at 10. All the members present except <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Meriwether</persRef> who is gone to Georgia— The second Letter from
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> to me was read, with a statement respecting the
							missions to Venezuela, New-Grenada, Chile and Peru— There were
							voluminous documents respecting our relations with Sardinia, Naples, and
							Turkey. <persRef ref="everett-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> moved that a proviso should be proposed to be
							added to the diplomatic appropriations, that if any of the ministers
							abroad should be recalled in the course of the year, the remnant of his
							salary for the year might be applied to the quarter for return.— In the
							house <persRef ref="shields-benjamin">Shields</persRef> of Alabama made
							a pass to crowd in a series of Resolutions looking to the defence of the
							South, and by dint of pushing and perseverance carried two or three of
							them. Reports from Committees were called— I reported from the Committee
							of foreign Affairs the Senate Bill 64. for the relief of the legal
							representatives of <persRef ref="vail-aaron">Aaron Vail</persRef>,
							deceased, heretofore Consul at L’Orient; without amendment— Proffit
							called for some explanation of the bill, and it passed without
							opposition— I presented also a report adverse to the claim of <persRef
								ref="dumas-abigail">Abigail Dumas</persRef>, which at my motion was
							laid on the table— When the select Committees were called I asked leave
							to report from the Committee on the Smithsonian bequest a Bill; but the
							bill itself was at my house. <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> had presented to the house, and referred to the
							Committee a claim of <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>
							for extra services in recovering the money, and the <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said he had additional documents
							to present<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> relating to that claim— I
							moved that the Committee should be discharged from the further
							consideration of the claim and that it be referred to the Committee of
							claims—which with faint opposition from C. J. Ingersoll was carried. In
							Committee of the whole on the Union the diplomatic appropriations came
							up. the Committee rose and the house adjourned. Conversation with

								P. Van Ness</persRef> some time Minister of the United States in

								ref="vail-aaron">Aaron Vail</persRef>, under Forsyth chief Clerk of

							Affairs, and that the Committee were now engaged in the examination of
							his claims to allowances; and the action of the Department of State upon
							them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Ness’s visit detained me so

							of a <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker’s</persRef> draft of February

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign affairs, at half past 9 this

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stuart</persRef> however being

							read a long report, upon the petition of <persRef ref="mowry-jabez"
								>Jabez Mowry</persRef> and<space/>others inhabitants of Lubeck in the
							State of Maine, complaining of the condition of our trade with the
							British American Colonies— Appended to the report were sundry
							resolutions, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing presented the
							alternative of a Bill— After some discussion, the Committee authorised
							Cushing to prevent the report to the house, with one set of his
							resolutions— He asked me, if I was willing to move the printing of an
							extra number of copies of the report which I readily promised to do. And
							he enquired, if I would consent to his annexing in the appendix to the
							report my article in the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> number of the
							American Quarterly Review on the subject— I said I should have no
							objection to that— In the house <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> had yesterday moved the printing of 5000 more
							extra-copies of the two reports from the Committee of manufacture 5000
							having already been printed and distributed— <persRef ref="warren-lott"
								>Lott Warren</persRef> had objected, which laid over the motion for
							one day— This morning Fillmore renewed it and moved the previous
							question.— Warren renewed his objection but the <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said, that after the previous
							question, it was too late, and the motion was carried— Fillmore moved a
							Resolution to take the general appropriation bill out of Committee of
							the whole on Saturday at Noon. I objected, saying that after Wise’s
							speech of yesterday, I held it indispensible to occupy the floor a
							considerable time, and I was unwilling to abridge the time of others who
							might wish to reply to me— <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Llandaff W.
								Andrews</persRef> a Nimrod Wildfire from Kentucky, moved as an
							amendment to Fillmore’s motion, that the Bill should be taken out of
							Committee this day at 4 O’Clock but the motion of Andrews was rejected,
							and that of Fillmore carried by yeas and nays 100 to 73.— I voted
							against it— The Loan Bill, returned from the Senate with an amendment
							was then taken up by suspension of the rules 111 to 38. <persRef
								ref="clifford-nathan">Cifford</persRef> moved a sneaking amendment
							to the Senate’s Amendment, and called the yeas and nays— Fillmore moved
							the previous question which was carried— Clifford’s amendment was
							rejected 88 to 101. and the amendment of the Senate was adopted without
							a division— Cushing presented his report on the colonial trade with a
							resolution requesting the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							to negotiate— I moved the printing of 10000 extra copies, but objection
							was made and the case lies over for a week— Committee of the whole on
							the Union— General Appropriation bill.— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles"
								>Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> in a speech of an hour and a half,
							started new game. I answered him partly till at 4. the Committee rose

						<p><persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef> speech
							yesterday in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon a
							motion to strike out and reduce the appropriation for Ministers to
							Vienna and Berlin by razeeing them down to the rank of Chargé
							d’Afffaires, was a Congreve rocket thrown into the house to kindle a
							blazing War spirit and push a stumbling block in the way of the
							negotiation with Great Britain— Profligate as were his leading
							principles, and glaring with absurdity as were his leading arguments and
							perverted and distorted as were his leading facts, such was the
							impression of his speech upon the house, that when he sat down, every
							eye in the house was fastened on me, as if in a voice of thunder to call
							upon me to meet him. I was almost prostrated by the <hi rend="italic"
								>loudness</hi> and suddenness of the <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>
							call— I paused for a moment to give every other member the chance for
							the floor—no one rose— I did, under a sense of depression from which I
							could not wholly recover. My discourse was rambling and desultory— The
							result of my speech was apparently satisfactory to my friends; but by no
							means to myself— <persRef ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef>
							invited me to dine with him at his lodgings at <persRef
								ref="hyatt-unknownjqa-13608">Hyatt’s</persRef>; which I accordingly
							did— It was a parting dinner to <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi

								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Saltonstall</persRef> were there and the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morgan</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="taliaferro-john">Taliaferro</persRef>, and two or three others—
							The agitation and exertion of a long extemporaneous speech, followed by
							a convivial dinner aggravated my catarrhal cough, and I had a disturbed,
							restless and uncomfortable night. Yet I was to resume my speech not half
							finished this morning, and although Ingersoll’s speech of yesterday, and
							mine were reported <hi rend="strikethrough">of</hi> in the National
							Intelligencer of this morning, and <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise’s</persRef> of the day before, I had yet not time to read them
							before the House was in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union
							with the general Appropriation bill under consideration, and I had the
							floor to continue and conclude my speech— I had found yesterday in the
							Congress Library the volume of <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah"
								>Niles’s</persRef> register, the Correspondence between <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rabun-william">Governor Rabun</persRef> of Georgia, and in the
							Independent Newspaper of this morning there is a Letter from a
							correspondent at Paris, relating the proceedings in the French chamber
							of deputies on the address to the <persRef ref="louis-philippe"
								>king</persRef> when the amendment passed for preventing the
							ratification by France of the Quintuple Slave-trade Treaty—both these
							documents I used in the speech of three hours with which I concluded my
							reply to Ingersoll and Wise— The instant I finished <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">Llandaff W. Andrews</persRef> ready to burst
							with rage, moved to reconsider the resolution to take the bill out of
							Committee at Noon to morrow; but <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
								>Campbell</persRef> of South Carolina spoke about an hour and a half
							against me— <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> then took the
							floor—the Committee rose and the house adjourned— My speech of this day
							stung the Slavocracy to madness.</p>

								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins</persRef> a
							missionary to Persia, and by <persRef ref="maryohannan">Mar
								Yohanan</persRef> a venerable Bishop of the Nestorians— The Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins
							read the 72<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm— He made a prayer from
							one sentence of which I perceived that a member of the house was
							deceased— I was aware that it was <persRef ref="lawrence-joseph">Joseph
								Lawrence</persRef> of Washington County Pennsylvania—he had died of
							a congestive fever not half an hour before. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Perkins’s text was from Acts 14.27. And when they were come,
							and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had
							done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the
							Gentiles. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins presented a summary of
							the mission of <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="barnabas">Barnabas</persRef> to the Gentiles, and of their
							adventures at Antioch, where the disciples of Jesus first received the
							name of Christians; and he held forth the analogy between this part of
							the apostolic history, and that of his own mission to the Nestorians in
							Persia. Of this he gave a very interesting account— The Nestorians are a
							very ancient, small sect of Christians, living under Mahometan
							dominationn in the heart of Persia— Of their peculiar tenets he gave no
							distinct exhibition, but he gave them full and grateful testimony to the
							kindness with which they had received and treated the missionaries. He
							spoke also thankfully of the good office, and friendly assistance
							received from the British consuls and official agents in Persia— The old
							bishop Mar Yohanan, made himself a short address, in very intelligible
							English, and concluded by pronouncing the benediction in his own
							language.— After dinner, at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							church the evening service was performed by <persRef
								ref="chauncey-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chauncy</persRef>, son of the <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">late
								Commodore</persRef>, and he preached from John 16.32.— “I am not
							alone, because the father is with me.” Confidence in the upholding and
							sustaining arm of God in all trouble and affliction was the doctrine,
							urged with warm sensibility and persuasive argument by this talented
							young man. I had called yesterday at the National Intelligencer Office,
							and asked <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> to send me the slips of my speech of yesterday to be
							published to morrow, for my revisal— He sent them this evening—seven
							columns of small print, reported by <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur"
								>Stansbury</persRef>.— I employed two hours in revising them, and
							found very few and slight corrections to make.— This speech was made
							under deep and solemn conviction of duty— Its issues are with the father
							of Spirits— I must abide by its consequences— May they be auspicious to
							the Peace of my Country, and to human freedom—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="borland-alexander">Borland</persRef> the Carpenter was here
							this morning, and I settled with him, an old bill— He asked me whether
							the appropriation bill would soon pass— I told him it would pass the
							house on Wednesday, and I supposed the Senate a few days later. He said
							he had no claim of his own—but he had debts due to him from persons
							whose means of payment consisted in the debts of the Treasury to them.
							How this complaint like that of <persRef ref="tibbits-john"
								>Tibbits</persRef> and <persRef ref="hodgkin-john">Hodgkin</persRef>
							exemplifies the extent of injustice and wrong, which infects every vein
							and artery of the community, by the insolvency of the Treasury. <persRef
								ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peddrick</persRef> the sculptor came and invited me to visit his
							studio again— He said he had some new works, executed since I was
							there—particularly one of disappointed love. And he spoke of the
							bas-reliefs he was preparing for the pedestal of <persRef
								ref="greenough-horatio">Greenough’s</persRef> Statue of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="cameron-george">George Cameron</persRef> an intelligent old
							Scotchman came and took back the papers he had last left with me
							concerning his invention for preventing the bursting of Steam-engine
							boilers. He says he exhibited the same papers to me, and explained them
							to my entire satisfaction, when I was President— He affirms that by his
							invention one sixth of the pressure of steam now used will produce the
							same impetus of propulsion—but he is yet none the richer for his
							ingenuity.— At the house, before the prayer <persRef ref="irvin-james"
								>James Irvin</persRef> of Milesburg, Pennsylvania, came to my Seat,
							and enquired, if I would consent to have my name placed on the list of
							the Committee of Arrangements for the funeral of <persRef
								ref="lawrence-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef>, to which I cheerfully assented— Immediately
							after the reading of the journal <persRef ref="irwin-william">William W.
								Irwin</persRef> of Pittsburg announced the decease of his colleague,
							Joseph Lawrence pronounced a suitable Eulogy upon his character, and
							moved the usual resolutions, which were adopted without further
							observation and the house adjourned.— <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef> came to me and said
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Irvin had insisted that my name
							should be set down as Chairman of the Committee of arrangements. Against
							this I remonstrated; the chairman being always at these funerals a
							member from the State represented by the deceased.— But Burch said they
							would take it to heart if I refused, and I acquiesced.— After the
							adjournment I came home as soon as I could— This evening, <persRef
								ref="foster-jc">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster</persRef>, an
							Armourer from the arsenal at Springfield and <persRef ref="wilcox-pf"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilcox</persRef> , a citizen of
							that town, came to me, with a grievous complaint of an innovation in the
							superintendence of that establishment changing it from a civil to a
							military organization— They represented that the change was equally
							dissatisfactory to the workmen and to the citizens— This is the subject
							upon which I have the counter report of <persRef ref="ripley-james"
								>Major Ripley</persRef>, on the other side— It is to come before
							Congress, I do not exactly how but I promised to give my attention to
							it— Evening of preparations for the party.</p>

						<p>I went to the Capitol immediately after 9. O’Clock this Morning to attend

							of the Committee attended, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>, and <persRef ref="stuart-alexander"
								>Stuart</persRef> and they immediately withdrew— I took up my
							unfinished report on the Smithsonian bequest, and wrote a few lines, but

							and Pennsylvania delegation assembled in the Speaker’s chamber; whence
							with the mourning black crape and gloves and the white scarfs, we rode
							amid torrents of rain to <persRef ref="sprig-b">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Sprigg’s</persRef> across the Capitol square— There I
							saw the lifeless face of <persRef ref="lawrence-joseph">Joseph

							procession with the coffined corpse, to the hall of the house of
							representatives the funeral service was then performed by <persRef

								>President</persRef> with his Cabinet the Senate and house of

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Underwood at the door of the

							had already adjourned the house and left the Capitol. The hackman took

							afternoon, and returned them to him when he called for them this Evening
							and he engaged to have the whole speech on both days, published in a

						<p><persRef ref="brent-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Brent</persRef> called this morning to enquire what had been done,
							concerning his memorial claiming compensation for the services of his
							deceased brother <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel</persRef>, in the
							interval between the return of <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward
								Livingston</persRef> home, and the arrival of <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Lewis Cass</persRef> as his successor; a space of
							nearly or quite two years. I promised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent to give all due attention to the claim which I believe to be just—
							I called at the Treasury Department with the Treasury Notes which they
							had sent me instead of payment of 500 dollars issued on the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of April 1841. with the 30 dollars
							interest upon them—and they had dated the new Notes the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this present April— I was told that
							not having delivered up the former Notes till the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> the warrant had been dated on that
							day—and that I had forfeited the intervening interest by my own
							lashes—which I said might have been alledged, if they had been prepared
							to pay me, when I did come for payment— They referred me to the <persRef
								ref="forward-walter">Secretary</persRef>, who immediately
							acknowledged the obligation to correct the date; but there was some
							difficulty from the cumbersome machinery of the public accounts, and
								<persRef ref="young-mcclintock">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Young</persRef> the chief-clerk said it would be necessary to state
							over again the whole account. I left the new notes with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward, and was detained by this business
							so as to be a half an hour belated at the house— I found them taking
							questions, on the amendments adopted in Committee of the whole to the
							appropriation Bill— <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of
							Maine raised a point of order, which the Speaker overruled— Clifford
							appealed.— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved to
							lay the appeal on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 86 to
							75.— After which the vote on the amendment to strike out all the
							contingencies was carried 105 to 68— The vote in Committee of the whole
							upon <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef>
							motion to reduce the item for the expenditures of all the judicial
							Courts from 475000 to 375000 dollars was confirmed by yeas and nays 106
							to 75. A proviso limiting the emoluments of the district Attorney, and
							clerk of the district and circuit Courts of the Northern district of
							New-York was also carried 118 to 51. and another that no part of the
							appropriation should be applied to pay the expence of printing records
							for the judges of the Supreme Court except in cases to which the United
							States are parties.— sundry other amendments were adopted and some
							rejected and some were adopted; and finally the bill was passed to be
							engrossed and passed without a division— <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph"
								>Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> from the Committee of Ways and Means
							then reported a General Bill for all the striken out contingencies—twice
							read and committed— The apportionment bill was taken up and postponed.

						<p>I went this morning with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth;adams-joseph"
								>Elizabeth C. and Joseph H. Adams</persRef> to the City Hall, and
							there, <persRef ref="hall-david">David A. Hall</persRef> a Commissioner

								ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy</persRef> woodlot in Braintree,
							finally divided between the descendents of his heirs as tenants in
							common— At the House, immediately after the reading of the Journal,
							Horace Everett moved a Resolution to cease debate on the apportionment
							bill and take it out of Committee into the house next Monday at 12.
							O’Clock— This was outrageous— It would have nearly stifled <hi

								ref="andrews-landaff">Llandaff W. Andrews</persRef>, a man quite as
							summary, and much more fiery than Everett, moved to lay his resolution,

								ref="kennedy-john">John P. Kennedy</persRef> presented a strong
							Tariff petition from Baltimore signed by 9094 names, praying for
							protection, countervailing and tonnage duties—brought by a committee of
							28 gentlemen from Baltimore, and 56. yards long.— He moved its
							reference, partly to the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union who have the tariff-bill before them, and partly to the Committee
							of Commerce.— He moved that it should be printed; but a petty debate
							arose between Kennedy and <persRef ref="mason-john2">John T.

							moved that the names of the signers should be printed—when <persRef

							number from 50 to 60,000. I voted against 60500. as too large— The

						<p>The regular presentation of Petitions, memorials and resolutions has been
							broken up, and annulled by the operation and consequences of the gag, or
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule of the house— The rule stands
							on paper that for the first thirty days of each Session, the first order
							of every day on the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker’s</persRef>
							taking the chair and the reading of the journal of the preceding day,
							shall be the presentation and reception of Petitions— Until the practice
							of refusing to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> abolition Petitions was
							started this process was a mere formality— All petitions were
							received—scarcely ever read, but referred to the Committees nominated by
							the presenting member, or laid silently on the table, and ordered if he
							desired it to be printed. The call for petitions never consumed more
							than the morning hour, and never occasioned debate. But from the time
							when the question of <hi rend="italic">receiving</hi> petitions was
							raised, the objections to reception have so multiplied, as well as the
							number of Petitions, and the objects prayed for, and the chicanery
							against reception has become so tenacious, suspicious and fractious,
							that it has gone far to annihilate the right and the reception of
							Petitions altogether— The suspension of the rules almost every day of
							the first 30 substitutes other business instead of the reception of
							Petitions— After that, the receiving days are confined to once a
							fortnight— The call of the States takes two or three days to be gone
							through, and a member is not sure of a chance to present a petition of
							any kind once in six weeks.— They accumulate in my hands till I have
							hundreds in my draw, without knowing what to do with them. I have been
							compelled heretofore, and again at this Session to propose, that every
							member should be authorised to send his petitions to the Clerk’s table,
							and the Speaker should decide, which of them should be received, laid on
							the table, or referred to appropriate Committees.— Under this order
							which was adopted, <persRef ref="goode-patrick">P. G. Goode</persRef> of
							Ohio, yesterday laid on the table, certain Resolutions of a popular
							meeting severely censuring the house for their censure of <persRef
								ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>— The fact was stated on the
							journal, at which <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> flew into a
							Passion and moved to strike out that part of the journal; which after an
							abortive motion of <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> to
							lay it on the table, lost 74 to 93. was carried 98 to 75.— Everett then
							moved an additional Section to the Apportionment Bill, providing for a
							proportional representation of the fractions. The rest of the day was
							consumed in Committee of the whole to dispose of the undebatable private
							Bills to which the first and fourth Fridays are devoted by the rules of
							the house— The Committee was finally palsied by <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> who said we would oppose every bill
							that should be called up— They rose and he house adjourned over to
							Monday. In the Evening I went with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

							portion of his just claim; and even that the umpire baron <persRef
								ref="ronne-friedrich">Roenne</persRef> had reduced. But of the award
							confirmed he could not obtain payment of a dollar— That he had just now
							returned from a journey to New-York and Boston, in both of which Cities
							he had made fruitless attempts to raise even so small a sum as five
							thousand dollars, at heavy interest upon the hypothecation of this
							award, and had been unable to raise so much as one thousand dollars— He
							had therefore returned here in utter destitution of the means of
							supporting himself and his family from week to week and from day to day—
							He had made attempts to see the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> without success, and
							he came to enquire if he could not obtain my influence to urge congress

							them what they proposed to do, with regard to these liquidated claims;
							and if he could obtain no satisfactory answer from them, and wished to
							memorialize Congress if he desired it I would present his memorial,
							though I should advise him to apply to some more popular and influential

						<p>The visit of the members of the house of Representatives to the two armed
							Steamers Missouri and Mississippi, yesterday, was by special invitation
							of the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>— They
							were brought here for that particular purpose— They cost each of them
							over half a million of dollars; carry only ten Paixhan guns each, and
							are fit only for the defence of harbours— There was an attempt made in
							the house on Friday to get a vote that the house should go in a body,
							with the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> at their head; but
							it failed for want of gratuitous vehicles— There were about 100 members
							went on board yesterday.— The <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> came with all his Cabinet Ministers, and was
							received with a salute from the Paixhan guns— Hail Columbia from the
							Marine band, and the manning of the yards with a scanty exhibition of
							men.— Few of the members of Congress noticed at all the presence of the
							President. This sudden Virginian overflow of zeal for the patronage of
							the Navy comes reeking hot from the furnace of Slavery.— Tis a wholesome
							stream from a polluted fountain— This morning I went alone and heard
								<persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> at the Capitol— His text was 2. Samuel 18.33. “And
							the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and
							wept; and as he went, thus he said, O my son <persRef ref="absalom"
								>Absalom</persRef>! my son, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had
							died for thee, O Absalom my son, my son!” From this somewhat singular
							text the preacher made up a brief discourse, not remarkably apposite to
							the edification or instruction of his auditory. Not like the Petit
							Carême of <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>. The
							Congressional chaplains never think of their hearers; and indeed very
							few of the members ever attend to hear them. The history of Absalom’s
							rebellion is full of human nature in its nakedness, for instruction,
							warning and reproof. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tustin’s improvement
							of his text was delicately to inform the members of Congress, that each
							and every one of us was an Absalom, in rebellion against the kingdom of
							our heavenly father— This is common-place calvinistic morality—without
							substantial meaning— At Saint John’s Church at half past 4 this
							afternoon, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read Evening prayers for the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Easter, and preached from
							Jeremiah 32.38. [“]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
							39. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me
							for ever, for the good of them, and their children after them: 40. And I
							will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away
							from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that
							they shall not depart from me 41. Yea, I will rejoice over them to do
							them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole
							heart, and with my whole soul.” The text was almost as long as the
							Sermon; and more weighty— I called at <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson’s</persRef>, but he was riding out. Midshipman <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H. Adams</persRef>, and <persRef

						<p>I called at the Bank of the Metropolis, and received the balance of my
							deposit there in specie— And after many months of unjustifiable delay,
							made up a packet of the manuscript of <persRef ref="elliot-samuel"
								>Samuel Elliot</persRef> of Brattleborough, Vermont upon the
							Constitution, Laws, Politics and morals, delivered to me last Summer
							with a request that I would read it, and give my opinion of it in
							writing.— A request which I ought instantly to have denied, but which
							from the reluctance of my nature to say no, I did receive, without
							promising a written opinion, which I soon found that I ought not to
							give.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot has written to me twice,
							requesting me to return his manuscript, to him a jewel of inestimable
							value. I ought long since to have returned it. I put it with an
							apologetic Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot, this morning
							in the Post-Office of the House— This was the regular day of call to the
							States for Petitions. Pendleton of Ohio made a faint show of a wish to
							present his Resolutions from Cincinnati disapproving the censure of
								<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>; but the house
							would not hear him. <persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>
							proposed to take up and pass the private Bills reported from the
							Committee of the whole to the house last Friday— No. <persRef
								ref="cowen-benjamin">Cowen</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of
							Claims obtained leave for that Committee to sit during the sitting of
							the house for one week— <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef>
							called up a Bill reported from the Committee of Commerce, to prohibit
							the transportation of passengers or Letters from Port to Port of the
							United States by foreign ships or vessels— This is a new question
							started by the recent practice of the British West-India Mail Steamers
							ranging along our Coast, and stopping at all our Ports from Savannah to
							Boston.— This already brings them in collision with our Post-Office Laws
							and Stage running and Rail-road companies, and produced this bill.— It
							was on the point of being driven through without debate, till <persRef
								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef> started a doubt, which soon
							kindled into a warm discussion— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> blew a flourish of trumpets about the colonial

								ref="cooper-mark">Mark A. Cooper</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> in hatred of internal industry,
							blazed out for free trade, and the rights of the Citizen.— The bill was

								White</persRef>, editor of the Southern literary Messenger called on

								>Lieutenant Maury</persRef>, upon the right of Search, which he had
							lent me last Saturday, and requested me to read and give my opinion of
							it. He now asked my opinion, and I told him I disagreed with it
							altogether— That Lieutenant Maury’s Law, was Quarter deck Law—do no
							right; and take no wrong— That He assumed erroneous Law, and principles
							utterly untenable: and above all that the temper of his article was
							rancorous, and vituperative—a fault of all the diplomatic papers and
							dissertations on our side in this recent controversy— I desired him to
							ask Lieutenant Maury what he had to say to the 54<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> 98<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 99<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sections of our collection Law of

								<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> objected Weller moved a
							suspension of the rules; for which there were only 37. votes.— The
							Resolutions were not received— The effect of the gag-rule, against the
							reception of abolition petitions has familiarized the house to the
							refusal to receive petitions generally, that it operates upon all
							petitions and resolutions on all subjects, and it is now sufficient for
							any one member to object to the reception of any petition to ensure its

						<p>Change of climate. The last four or five days have been of midsummer

							with open windows at night.— The thundergust of yesterday followed by
							the soaking rain of last night, sunk the thermometer below 60, where it

								<persRef ref="nourse-charles">Charles J. Nourse’s</persRef> Office,

							Committee of Elections, and modified according to the Resolution first
							presented by <persRef ref="campbell-john7">J. Campbell</persRef> of
							South-Carolina requiring that the States should be districted to return
							only one representative for each district— The debate waxed warm, and
							assumed at once a bitter and rancorous party aspect— <persRef

								>Houston</persRef>, and <persRef ref="kennedy-andrew"
								>Kennedy</persRef> of Indiana, fought the battle, between State
							Sovereignty and Democracy, and between Slavery and Freedom involved in
							this question— There are now 3. free States, New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island
							and New-Jersey, returning 13 members and two Slave States Alabama and
							Georgia, returning 14. who elect by general ticket— Mississippi and
							Missouri, elect each two also by general ticket— The motion came from
							South-Carolina— State rights and nullification—but Campbell was not one
							individual of his party. Colquitt stoutly denied the Constitutional
							right of Congress to enact the districting of the States, and contended
							the Constitution by presenting that the members of the house of
							representatives should be chosen by the People absolutely required that
							every member should be chosen by the whole people. Summers made an
							excellent speech and produced a passage from the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef> papers fixing the meaning of
							the word manner in the constitution beyond all possibility of cavil; but
							Floyd, hunted up all the propositions of amendments in the State
							Conventions who adopted the Constitution, and used all those proposed
							amendments, upon this clause of the Constitution, as argument against
							the exercise of the power— Almost all the democrats who opposed the
							amendment declared their preference for the district system, but object
							to it as increasing the controul of Congress over the State
							Legislatures— Houston was keen upon Campbell— Kennedy is coarse and
							vulgar, and unreasonably; but not ineloquent—he did not finish. the
							Committee rose and the house adjourned at 4. <persRef

						<p>Morning visit from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Snelling of Boston, who

							the Massachusetts Board of Education, and of their Secretary Horace
							Mann— And a Speech of Abbott Lawrence at the Convention of shoe and

							March last— I had much conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Snelling on both these subjects, and also upon teaching of vocal music
							at the Schools— He reminded me that three or four years ago, he and
							Lowell Mason had visited me at Quincy to invite me to deliver an Address
							upon the opening of the Odeon, by the new Musical Association, and he
							read to me from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann’s report a Letter of
							enquiry upon the comparative merits of common workman, with the
							rudiments of common school educations and other persons of the same
							class without education— The letter was long; and I am ashamed to
							confess that just as he was finishing the reading of it, I dropped
							asleep— At the house, as soon as the journal of yesterday was read
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> asked leave to offer a

								>President</persRef> for the reports of the Commissioners or any of

								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> objected Briggs moved a

								>Speaker</persRef> that the motion was not admissible— After much

							this question, the Speaker reversed his own decision, and received the
							motion for reconsideration—this brought on a tart and bitter debate, in
							which <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> arraigned the committee
							for presenting the report, and Poindexter for communicating it to the
							committee— At the same time he glorified Poindexter for making the
							report, which he said would prove to be the most powerful anti-tariff
							document that ever was presented to this house— And that the whole South
							and especially South-Carolina ought to erect an imperishable monument to
							his memory—but he could tell New-England Gentlemen, that some of the
							most distinguished men and highest families in Boston and Lowell would
							be implicated in charges of bribery and corruption, and it would
							ultimately involve every member from Massachusetts on this floor— Not a
							member from Massachusetts raised his voice to repel this imputation—but
								<persRef ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> retorted with Wormwood
							and gall upon Wise— The motion for reconsideration was rejected 76 to
							84— And the house took up private bills for engrossment and passage—
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> moved an

						<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher called on me again this morning,
							and I returned to him <persRef ref="fletcher-thomas">his
								brother’s</persRef> Letter— I had some further conversation with him
							upon his project of transferring a Colony of yankee farmers into
							Virginia which I gave him to understand I thought very hazardous, if not
							impracticable;—he has no doubt another plan not yet disclosed; that is
							to solicit my influence to obtain some place for him under the
							government—a project more hopeless than that of turning a yankee farmer
							into a Virginian— I received last evening a Letter of the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> from <persRef ref="robbins-edward">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E. H. Robbins</persRef> of Boston,
							with a tariff memorial from himself, and about 30 other woolen
							manufacturers, with a request to me to present it, and have it referred
							to the Committee of Manufactures, and printed— This incident afforded me
							an opportunity to meet this morning <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise’s</persRef> base and malignant attack yesterday, upon the
							manufacturers of Boston and Lowell, and upon every member of the
							Massachusetts delegation in the house— So immediately after the reading
							of the journal I addressed the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef>, and asked the general consent of the house to
							present the memorial of Edward H. Robbins and about 30 other
							manufacturers, of Boston, Lowell and other places; and I said I should
							move its reference to the Committee of the whole on the state of the
							Union, to whom was referred the tariff bill reported by the Committee of
							Manufactures, and that it be printed with the names of the signers—
								<persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brown-charles3">Charles Brown</persRef> objected; but withdrew
							their objections, when I moved to suspend the rules, and referred to the
							attack by Wise yesterday, upon every member of the Massachusetts
							delegation. I then proceeded to comment upon Wise’s speech, which soon
							brought him up to explain—to disclaim—and to change his tone— It brought
							up <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> too, and several
							others, till a rabid thirst appeared for an inflammatory general debate;
							which the Speaker decided must lie over till the next Petition day under
							the rule— <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> appealed—
								<persRef ref="warren-lott">Lott Warren</persRef> moved to lay the
							appeal on the table, which was carried. Private bills were taken up.
							Tedious debate on motion to reconsider the engrossment of the <persRef
								ref="farrow-nimrod">Nimrod Farrow</persRef> Bill—reconsidered—the
							bill rejected 84 to 43. <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">L. W.
								Andrews</persRef> changes his vote and then moves a reconsideration.
							Call of the house Quorum and no Quorum— Previous question— Abortive
							motions to adjourn— Message from the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef>, with the three reports of <persRef
								ref="poindexter-george">Poindexter</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Kelly</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Stewart</persRef> on the
							investigation of the New-York custom-house— Wise moves to print them
							all, and makes another speech of an hour, apologetic and explanatory for
							himself, and vindicatory for the President— Adjourn at 6. O’Clock—
							Marine band music— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer,
							and left with the foreman, the Memorial of E. H. Robbins and the woollen
							manufacturers to be published Monday Morning— Received afterwards a
							second Letter, from E. H. Robbins of the 28<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> desiring to substitute another memorial for that which I
							have presented.</p>
