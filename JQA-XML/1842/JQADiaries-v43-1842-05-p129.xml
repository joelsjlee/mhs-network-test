						<p>In consequence of the Letter received last evening from <persRef
								ref="robbins-edward2">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> E. H.
								Robbins</persRef> I went this morning to the Office of the National
							Intelligencer to take back the Memorial, which I had left there last
							evening for publication— I found at the Office only one labourer, and
							after looking round for the paper without success he took me to the
							house of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Donohue</persRef>, with whom I had left the memorial— I roused
							Donohue from his bed, and said I had called at the Office to request the
							return of the Memorial, which he had promised to publish to-morrow
							morning—he said he would send it to me— He did so afterwards, and with
							it sent the manuscript report by <persRef ref="wheeler-henry"
								>Wheeler</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Niles</persRef> of my remark
							in the house yesterday— I went alone to the Capitol this morning, and
							heard <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> preach to a very thin auditory from Luke 14.18.
							“And they all with one consent began to make excuse.” The discourse was
							upon the indifference of, the generality of mankind to making profession
							of religion.— This is the ever-memorable parable, containing the words
							compel them to come in—the misconstruction of which has kindled all the
							fires of persecution in the Christian world— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tustin took no notice of them but exhausted himself in a
							feeble scolding fit at the invited guests, who all with one consent
							begin to make excuse.— There is a curious contrast between the crowds
							that block up every avenue to the Speakers chair to hear tinkling cymbal
								<persRef ref="maffitt-john">Maffit</persRef> and the half-empty
							seats of the members, when they have nothing to listen to but the
							languid fervour of this worthy man Tustin— There is no drop of nectar in
							his cup— On returning home I found the manuscript notes of my yesterdays
							skirmish, which needed little alteration— After dinner I attended
							Church, where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the evening prayers for the fifth
							Sunday after Easter, and preached from Isaiah 55.8. [“]For my thoughts
							are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord 9.
							For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways, higher
							than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.” The delusive
							propensity of mankind to consider their creator as made after their own
							image is a theme of easy but not very novel discourse— I walked out this
							evening with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
							paid a visit at our neighbour <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General
								Jesup’s</persRef>— He was not at home, but we saw <persRef
								ref="jesup-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jesup</persRef>. The
							latter part of the evening <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> spent with us.— Lieutenants <persRef
								ref="alden-bradford">Alden</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="freeman-william2">Freeman</persRef> who called to visit our
							ladies last Evening are the Aids de camp of the <persRef

								Scott</persRef>.</p>

							urging the immediate appointment of a Postmaster at that place, the
								<persRef ref="kingman-john">present incumbent having

								Fuller</persRef> one of his Assistants, to whom I gave to read one
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s Letters, and who assured me

							President of the United States—censured the committee on public
							expenditures—for producing <persRef ref="poindexter-george"
								>Poindexter’s</persRef> report—censured the house for hot haste in

							defiance. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> then drew and

							and the first information he received was the appointment of another

							requested my friendly attention to the consideration of his claim, and

						<p>I undertook this morning to assort in alphabetical monthly files the

							but it absorbed all the leisure of the day, and did not half accomplish

								rend="superscript">st.</hi> and 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							verses of the 61<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> chapter of Isaiah— I
							told him it was a very hazardous thing to attempt a paraphrase in
							English verse from the Book of Isaiah. <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope</persRef> was the only man I believed who ever had done it
							with success— Nevertheless, in the hope to gratify him, I would try my
							hand at this version and let him know the result in a few days— He also
							very urgently invited me to deliver the introductory Lecture before the
							Lyceum at their next Winters course, and said there were about 700
							members of their Lyceum— I told him, if I should deliver any Lectures
							next Autumn, other than to the Quincy Lyceum and before the
							Massachusetts historical Society at Boston, I would hold myself engaged
							for the Lyceum at Beverley.— <persRef ref="morehead-james">M<hi

						<dateline>Washington Monday 9. May 1842</dateline>
						<p><date>9. V— </date>Monday—</p>
						<p>There was a notification in this morning’s National Intelligencer of a
							Meeting of the National Institute for the promotion of Science, at their
							Hall at 8 O’Clock this Evening— I had received some six weeks since a
							long wooden box carefully covered with Oil-cloth, from <persRef
								ref="flugel-johann">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. G.
								Flügel,</persRef> Consul of the United States at Leipzic in Saxony,
							and addressed to me. I had received last year a similar box, the
							contents of which were for the National Institute for the promotion
							which I had regularly presented to them, at their meeting on the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last December— Supposing that this
							box was intended also for the National Institute, I had left it
							unopened, until there should be a meeting of the Society; and I went to
							the Patent Office this Evening for that purpose— I found the outside
							door of the building locked, and no appearance of light within— I had
							been about half an hour belated, by bethinking myself before I left home
							to open the box, where I found nothing for the institute, but a long
							engraved print, of sundry public buildings in Leipsic, a despatch
							directed to <persRef ref="tyler-john">President John Tyler</persRef>—a
							despatch to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>
							Secretary of State, and a despatch directed to me, with eight new small
							Saxon silver coins— The Letter to me, was a complaint with long and
							bitter lamentations, on the neglect to answer his former Letters by me,
							and the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, and especially of the
							disallowance at the Treasury of sundry items of his account amounting to
							168 dollars 95 1/2 cents, 100 dollars of which are for what he calls a
							half uniform— And he sends this account, thus riddled at the Treasury
							Department with the charge upon me to make his remonstrances against its
							curtailments available— At the house after the usual half hour of
							surreptitious business introduced in evasion of all order the unfinished
							business of last Thursday was resumed and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> had the floor in reply to <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>. He made a most anxious
							and elaborate and ostentatious defence of the right of the President to
							institute this investigating Commission— So sudorifically laboured that
							he brought me very seriously to doubt its legality. Underwood had
							indiscreetly and ignorantly alluded more than once to my appointment of
							Ministers to the Congress of Panama— Cushing took advantage of this, and
							called directly upon me for my purposes and views on that occasion,
							which I freely gave— I cited the appointments of <persRef
								ref="morris-gouverneur">Gouverneur Morris</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="jones-john-paul">Paul Jones</persRef> by <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>— The
							controversy between <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> and the Senate in 1814. and the
							appointment by <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> of Commissioners to South America, in
							1818.— I abridged this part of Cushing’s speech— After a good deal of
							chaffering an order was passed to print the other reports and the
							testimony; and the debate was postponed to take up the Amendments of the
							Senate to the appropriation Bill. Adjourned after 4.</p>

						<p>As I was going from home this morning to attend the Committee of foreign
							Affairs, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dutee J. Pearce</persRef> of Newport, Rhode-Island called on me. He
							is one of the leading members of a party in that State, who have
							undertaken to atchieve a revolution in its government; by the formation
							of a Constitution upon the principle of universal suffrage, instead of
							the freehold qualification hitherto maintained, under the Charter of
								<persRef ref="charles-ii">Charles the 2<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi></persRef> which that State has adhered to, instead of
							substituting for it as all the others of the old States have done a
							Constitution enacted by the People themselves— This freehold
							qualification of voters has been many years rankling and festering in
							the heart of the State and frequent attempts have been made in the
							Legislature, constituted as it was, to obtain a call of a convention to
							form a Constitution discarding the property qualification of voters— All
							these attempts having failed, a popular movement was concerted and
							organized last Summer, and unlicensed meetings, of disqualified persons
							in every town of the State, who chose delegates to a convention which
							met at Providence last November and formed a Constitution, afterwards,
							voted for by upwards of 13000 inhabitants of the State in popular
							meetings in December.— After this the regular Legislature called a
							Convention which formed and proposed a Constitution, which the qualified
							voters afterwards rejected— The suffrage party then proceeded to
							organize their government, elected their government Legislative and
							Executive—and they have held a Session of their Legislature, and have
							assumed by acts of Legislation the government of the State upon
							themselves— Pearce acted in this assembly as one of the Representatives
							from Newport.— In the meantime the regular Governor and Legislature have
							been elected; held a meeting and proclaimed all the proceedings of the
							Suffrage party unlawful; and applied to the President of the United
							States, for the military interference of the Government of the Union,
							which has been granted— Pearce, with several others of the suffrage
							party have been arrested and held to bail under a charge of treason
							against the State— I could not wait to converse with him, but asked him
							to call upon me again— He said he would unless he should leave the city
							this day.— I attended the Meeting of the Committee; and afterwards the
							meeting of the house, where the amendments of the Senate to the general
							appropriation bill, were debated—until near five O’Clock, when the
							Committee rose and the house adjourned— The amendment of the Senate
							increasing from 50,000 to 100000 dollars, the appropriation, for the
							Boston Custom-house was disagreed to by the Committee— <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">R. C. Winthrop</persRef> departed

								Giddings</persRef> had yesterday requested an interview with me at
							my house this morning to which I had agreed and he came— He said that
							the army appropriation bill would shortly come up for the consideration
							of the house— There was an item of appropriation in it of 100000 dollars
							for the prosecution of the War in Florida, which he thought should be
							struckout— <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> with whom he had conversed upon the subject, was of
							the same opinion; and they had thought it best to consult with me,
							concerning the expediency of making the motion— I said I concurred
							entirely in the opinion that the item ought to be struck out, but I was
							not sure that it would be advisable at the present time to make the
							motion— It would undoubtedly breed a tempest— The whole system of policy
							of the Country, foreign and domestic, War and Peace, Slavery and the
							Slave-trade would be opened for debate on this motion, and the public
							feeling on this topic was so lukewarm, and so perverted even in the free
							States, that I could not ward off the doubt of the expediency of
							agitating it at all, by starting the game ourselves— We were interrupted
							by <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Radcliff’s</persRef> coming in to talk about the communication
							between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans over the Isthmus of Panama— He
							intimated to me, that he was or would be an applicant for an appointment
							as a diplomatic agent to visit the isthmus, with a view to organize
							again some company to undertake the accomplishment of the work, with a
							guarantee of the principal powers of Europe and of the U.S. for the
							neutrality and freedom of the passage to all Nations, and at all times.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Radcliff spoke to me also about the
							claim of <persRef ref="rhind-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rhind</persRef>, and about the Bill for deducting agent commissions
							from the awards in favour of certain claimants retained at the Treasury
							for debts due from the claimants themselves— At the house the day was
							again consumed in committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon
							the Amendments of the Senate to the civil and diplomatic appropriation
							Bill. an Amendment of the Senate appropriating 28000 dollars for
							completing the Custom-house at New-York, after a wrangling debate of two
							hours, was rejected by tellers 63 to 66. I moved to increase the half
							outfit for <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Christopher
								Hughes</persRef> as Chargé d’Affaires to Holland, to a full outfit,
							and made a speech in support of the motion— <persRef ref="jones-john9"
								>John W. Jones</persRef> opposed it with a speech— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> took the floor,
							and as it was 4. O’Clock moved the Committee to rise, which they did and
							the house adjourned— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Connell</persRef> was here this Evening. He thinks the
							proceedings of the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President of the United

								Radcliff</persRef> came again this morning, and disclosed more
							fully, his experiences in the application for the appointment of Consul
							at Lima in Peru. He held this office heretofore and wishes it now, for
							the purpose of visiting the Isthmus of Panama, on his way to Lima, with
							a view to the advancement of his project for the establishment of the
							communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, and he gave
							me the history of the several appointments to the Lima Consulate since
							his removal from it by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson</persRef>— The last was <persRef ref="bartlett-edwin">Edwin
								Bartlett</persRef>, who resigned some months since and there is now
							before the Senate the nomination of a Frenchman named <persRef ref="u"
								>Castelnou</persRef>, who is now in France.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Radcliff supposes him to be a dormant partner of a
							commercial house in Lima— He has applied to the <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> and to the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for this appointment,
							and has been curiously sported with by the, chief magistrate and the
							head of the Department in their different allegations to him, to account
							for the nomination of a foreigner in competition with him— He has some
							expectation that the Nomination will not be confirmed, in which he will
							however be disappointed. At the house, in Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union the amendments of the Senate to the Appropriation
							Bill were resumed and <persRef ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R.
								Ingersoll</persRef> supported by a speech my amendment to increase
							the half outfit for <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Christopher
								Hughes</persRef> upon his new appointment as Chargé d’Affaires at
							the Hague, to a full outfit The question upon my amendment in Committee
							was taken by tellers and carried 67 to 63. and afterwards in the house
							by yeas and nays 88 to 72— After much debate, we carried also the
							disagreement to an amendment of the Senate, to deprive the Secretary of
							State of the means of compensating dispatch Agents at New-York, Boston
							Liverpool and London— The house adopted the amendments reported by the
							Committee to the Senate’s amendments after which several executive
							communications <unclear>were</unclear> disposed of and the house adjourned at 4.
							O’Clock.— I Received at the Franklin Insurance Office a Semi-annual

								Thompson</persRef> called on me this morning to communicate to me
							some information respecting the cultivation of sugar from the cane with
							reference to the revisal of the Tariff, which must shortly be brought up
							for the consideration of Congress— He said there was great injustice and
							much fraud committed in consequence of the two denominations under which
							the duties are levied upon sugars—brown and clayed: and he spoke of some
							new invention for the manipulation of sugar which he had used upon his
							plantation in Louisiana, and with which the labour of eight men can be
							performed by one. He said if I would call at his house at some leisure
							time he would shew and explain its operation to me, and I promised to
							call.— He spoke also of the condition of his claim upon Mexico, which is
							very large, and which the late joint commission have left without a
							definitive decision upon its amount. At the House this was a day for the
							consideration of debatable private bills, but after the adoption of a
							Resolutions offered by Thompson for a Committee of investigation
							concerning the furnishing of the new Custom house at New-York, <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> sent to the Clerk’s table
							a Letter to him from the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, stating that a draught on the Department for an
							inconsiderable sum, had for want of funds at the Department been
							necessarily protested; and on that Letter M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fillmore, founded his motion to go into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union, to take up the Navy Appropriation Bill—which was
							carried— <persRef ref="clifford-nathan">Clifford</persRef> of Maine in
							the Chair— The first item, for the pay of the officers and men was
							upwards of three millions— <persRef ref="meriwether-james2"
								>Meriwether</persRef> of Georgia moved to reduce it nearly a
							million, to the sum appropriated last year— <persRef
								ref="fornance-joseph">Fornance</persRef> of Pennsylvania made a
							feeble attempt at a retrenchment speech; but was so little headed that
							he soon got out of humour, sat down and refused to proceed. A long and
							rambling debate ensued, upon the promotions and new appointments of
							Officers within the last year; a disproportionate number of whom are
							from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, the Chairman of the naval
							Committee, was argufying before a magistrate against the right of the
							Judge to bind him over to keep the Peace, out of the District— He came
							in at last and frightened Meriwether out of his economy, by the terror
							of Bermuda, the Gulf of Mexico, and abolitionism. <persRef

								ref="gurley-r">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> R. R.
								Gurley’s</persRef> published account of his mission to England in
							behalf of the colonization Society.— And referring to an item of
							appropriation of 5000 dollars for commercial agents on the coast of
							Africa introduced into the Bill as an Amendment to one of the Senate’s
							amendments at the motion of <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							and with the support of <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef>, he said it was a mere grant to that Society of
							that sum of money in disguise— That it had been represented as an
							expenditure for commercial purposes and the pretension that the British
							Government kept commercial agents on the coast of Africa with the intent
							to monopolize the trade there for English merchants— But it was all
							imaginary— The trade in palm oil, used in Europe for making soap was
							considerable and increasing but there were no English commercial agents
							on the coast; and never had nor can there be any good use for such
							agents from this Country.— At the house <persRef ref="dodge-henry">Henry
								Dodge</persRef> the Delegate from the Wiskonsin territory offered a
							resolution of enquiry of the <persRef ref="forward-walter">Secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef>, imputing gross official malversation to
								<persRef ref="doty-james">James D. Doty</persRef> the present
							Governor of the Territory, and with a long and vilifying preamble; which
							upon objection being made to its reception was received by suspension of
							the rules— <persRef ref="howard-jacob">Howard</persRef> of Michigan
							moved to strike out one of the accusatory whereases—which was carried.
							The previous question was then sprung— I objected both to the remainder
							of the preamble and to parts of the Resolution; avowing my readiness to
							vote for any motion of enquiry as to facts; but I was estopped from all
							argument. I moved to lay the whole matter on the table—lost by yeas and
							nays 26 to 158. and the resolution and the preamble were driven through
							like a loco-motive on a rail-road— <persRef ref="triplett-philip"
								>Triplett</persRef> moved a resolution of enquiry concerning certain
							recent promotions of Lieutenants in the Navy, but could not obtain a
							suspension of the rules for its consideration— The general appropriation
							bill returned from the Senate, receding from some of their amendments
							and insisting upon others, was then taken up— The house receded from one
							or two of theirs and insisted upon all the rest— A Committee of
							conference was appointed— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef>, myself and <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave

						<p>Whitsunday. There was a disastrous fire close in our neighbourhood, which
							broke out about 3. O’Clock this morning and continued till the dawn of
							day, and of which I knew nothing till it was over when I awoke, much
							alarmed at the trampling over my head, in our house, and the loud
							talking whence I feared it was from sudden illness in the family. The
							fire had been in the next Street, to that in which we live, and running
							nearly parallel and concentric with ours— There were burnt down a small
							dwelling house—the back building of another, occupied by <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-henry">Henry Van Rensselaer</persRef>, a member
							of the House from the State of New-York, and <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-mary;vanrensselaer-cornelia3;vanrensselaer-stephen3"
								>their children</persRef>, who were burnt out, but all saved— A
							stable with a Carriage and horses, and a Mechanics shop in which were
							deposited many wooden works belonging to the Patent Office— There has
							scarcely been a day for weeks without one or more alarms of fire—
							Several of them are ascertained to have been kindled by incendiaries—
							There is no doubt it was so in this case— The Mayor has issued a
							proclamation offering a reward of 300 dollars for detection of the
							culprit; but as yet without effect.— The morning was rainy— I attended
							the morning public worship at the Capitol, where <persRef
								ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef>
							preached from John 3.16— [“]For God so loved the world, that he gave his
							only begotten Son, that whosoever believith in him should not perish but
							have everlasting life”— There were not more than 40 persons present, and
							the services were very short— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt
							said he had been confined to a sick bed, and was now labouring under a
							very severe headache— That he was willing to preach at any time and at
							all times, and would preach next Sunday at the request of several
							persons from the text “joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that
							repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no
							repentance.” A silent enquiry occurred to me, whether this request came
							from the fact that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt had already
							preached a popular discourse on this text, or whether it was an allusive
							indication of his own experiences. Before dinner I had a morning visit
							from <persRef ref="caldwell-john">Sir John Caldwell</persRef>, recently
							arrived from the Province of New Brunswick, and after dinner <persRef
								ref="crofton-hugh">Captain Crofton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crespogny-george">Lieutenant Crespigny</persRef> of the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment of foot; absent upon leave from
							their regiment stationed at Bermuda, came and took leave going in the
							Cars to Baltimore— At S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for Whitsunday evening, and preached from Isaiah 40.1.2.

						<p>Isaiah 40.1. “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 2. Speak
							ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is
							accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she hath received of
							the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.” This was yesterday <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley’s</persRef> afternoon discourse text for Whitsunday— The
							theme was too large for the comment. These two and the three following
							verses have in them an awful sublimity still deepened by the
							versification of <persRef ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> Messiah,
							and the music of <persRef ref="handel-george">Handel’s</persRef> anthem—
							This morning at 9 O’Clock I attended at the chamber of the Senate’s
							Committee of Finance the Committee of Conference on the disagreeing
							votes of the two houses upon the civil and diplomatic appropriation
							bill— The managers on the part of the Senate, were <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> of Maine, <persRef
								ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef> of Georgia— Those of the House
							were <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Millard Fillmore</persRef> myself,
							and <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>— Fillmore and
							myself were in favour of all the points insisted on by the Senate, but
							Cave Johnson was perfectly intractable upon every point— Sundry
							concessions, were concerted between the two chairman to pacify Cave, but
							it was all in vain— He would agree to nothing, and Fillmore and I were
							finally obliged to accede to a compromise offered by the Managers of the
							Senate; and the house had been nearly an hour in Session when we made
							our report— I found <persRef ref="yulee-david">Levy</persRef> the jew
							delegate from Florida making a red hot speech against the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message, declaring his
							intention to put an end to the Florida War— The question was upon
							printing the message, and referring it to the Committee on the
							Territories which after some sparring of <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> and <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
								Cooper</persRef> was carried.— Fillmore then presented the report of
							the joint Committee of Conference; upon which the <persRef
								ref="white-john6">speaker</persRef> at first decided that the
							question must be taken upon the whole report at once— This is the
							parliamentary Law; but <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
								>Atherton</persRef> insisted on taking a separate question upon
							every point of difference; and produced a precedent to which the Speaker
							yielded.— Separate questions were taken on each point Cave Johnson made
							a bitter speech against the adoption of several parts of the report— It
							proposed a compromise of 75000 dollars for the custom house at Boston—
							It was taken by yeas and nays and carried 99 to 75.— The report for the
							New-York custom-house was conditional—carried also by yeas and nays. 92
							to 73— The Senate adopted the report of the Committee of conference by
							one vote, and notice of it was received by message to the House— The
							naval appropriation Bill was then taken up, and in the midst of a
							foolish speech of <persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of
							Illinois the Committee rose, and the house adjourned— Evening with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> at the concert

						<p><persRef ref="frazee-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frazee</persRef> called on me yesterday morning, before I went to
							the Capitol, to explain an unlucky incident, which has occurred within a
							few days, implicating his character— A paper purporting to be a copy of
							a Letter from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">late Secretary of the
								Treasury Levi Woodbury</persRef>, of 3. March 1841. was furnished by
							him to the Committee of Ways and Means, and was read in the house by
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fillmore</persRef> to shew his authority for expenditures to the
							amount of 28200 dollars, for finishing and furnishing the New-York
							Custom-house. A copy of the same Letter from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Woodbury, was contained in <persRef ref="poindexter-george"
								>Poindexter’s</persRef> report, differing from that furnished by
							Frazee, and this difference had been pressed as a falsification by
							Poindexter— Upon examination it was found that Poindexter’s copy was
							correct while in that of Frazee there were several interpolated words—
							When called upon to account for this he said he had made the copy from
							Memory. A gross indiscretion, which has subjected him to the imputation
							of fraud— This morning I attended the Meeting of the Committee of
							Foreign Affairs— I was myself belated a quarter of an hour, and found at
							the Committee-room only two members—<persRef ref="stuart-alexander2"
								>Stuart</persRef> and <persRef ref="meriwether-james2"
								>Meriwether</persRef>— It was past ten, before we formed a quorum.

								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef> absent—gone home. Several
							private claims were considered— One of a French Captain of a Merchant
							vessel named <persRef ref="u">Beziers</persRef>, asking for a grant of
							Land in consideration of his having saved the lives of the crew of an
							American vessel which in the year 1825 perished in the harbour of
							Cadiz—and another of the Captain and owner of the Spanish ship Sabine
							for saving the crew of an American vessel foundered at Sea— These cases
							were referred to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing for a report.—
							In the house, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost
								Johnson</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules for a joint
							Resolution to close the Session on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of June—lost 56 to 94. Navy appropriation Bill in Committee of the

							to prepare a new system of rules and laws for the regulation and
							government of the Navy— I took part in this debate— The Bill laid aside—
							Adjourned after 4.— I dined at <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Lord

								Thompson</persRef> also called on me, to speak of the debate
							yesterday upon the board to prepare a body of rules and regulations for

							board— <persRef ref="upshur-abel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							for admission to the President, all except one member of Congress,
							wolves of the antichamber, prowling for Offices I waited about half an
							hour, and then gave the despatch from <persRef ref="flugel-johann">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Flügel</persRef> the Consul at
							Leipsic, to a servant requesting him to deliver it to the President and
							left the house— I went to the Navy Department and held an hours
							conference with the Secretary Abel P. Upshur, upon the proposed revisal
							of the rules and regulations of the Navy and the re-organization of the
							Department.— As to the composition of the board I found that his
							expectation was to prepare the revisal of the rules and regulations
							himself, and to submit them to the board as a council— He was earnest to
							retain the Officers of the several degrees from the Post Captain, down
							to the Lieutenant in the board; but he thought it very proper to include
							an eminent lawyer, and also an Officer of the Marine Corps, but if he is
							to prepare a revised code himself it is doubtful whether any board of
							Officers be necessary at all— I spoke also to him of the Court Martial
							upon <persRef ref="clack-john">Captain Clack</persRef>, and the
							statement of <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">L. W. Tazewell</persRef>;
							and the Letter from <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef>,
							upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upshur’s opinion appeared to
							coincided with mine— What the practical result will be, I shall wait to
							see.— The house had been nearly an hour in session when I reached it—
								<persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> was in the midst of a
							very searching speech against the high appropriations of the Navy-bill—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> had already
							carried in the house a resolution to take out the Bill, from the
							Committee next Monday. <persRef ref="meriwether-james2"
								>Meriwether’s</persRef> amendment reducing the appropriation, nearly
							one million of dollars for pay of officers and Seamen, was carried by a
							vote of 72 to 53— <persRef ref="triplett-philip">Triplett</persRef> then
							moved an amendment providing that no part of the appropriation should be
							applied to pay officers suspended by sentence of a court martial, or
							officers who have been more than five years out of service— This gave
							rise to a warm debate, which continued till past 4. and in which I took
							part in opposition to the amendment and to an amendment to it, proposed
							by <persRef ref="warren-lott">Lott Warren</persRef>— When I closed,
								<persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> took the floor, the
							Committee rose and the house adjourned— Evening visit from <persRef

						<p>Cold— Rain— Fires rekindled in the writing chamber and dining room. The
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> went in grand military
							parade this morning to Baltimore to review the encampment on the borders
							of that city—but rain is a mortal foe to the glories of military triumph

							from the tented field— He did not even visit the encampment. In the

							relating to the construction of the engine for a steamer contemplated to

							objected— Pendleton moved a suspension of the rules, carried by yeas and
							nays, after a call of the house commenced and superseded 106 to 46—
							Pendleton then made a speech, and moved the previous question, which and
							the resolution itself were carried without a division— The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> presented a Letter from <persRef
								ref="lawrence-samuel2">Samuel Lawrence</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stone-william6">William W. Stone</persRef> complaining that in

							there are changes imputing dishonest and dishonourable conduct to them,
							and declaring their readiness, if the house think fit to submit to any

							presented a Letter from Poindexter himself, asking for the appointment
							of a select committee to examine the statements in his report and the
							evidence upon which he relies to support them— <persRef

						<p>The chill North-easter continues; but this day without rain— I wrote

								<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							<persRef ref="brown-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> G.

								rend="superscript">st.</hi> and 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							verses of the 61<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> chapter of Isaiah
							written at his request. Not a day passes but I receive Letters from the
							North and sometimes the West asking for an autograph, and a scrap of
							poetry or of prose, and from the South almost daily Letters of insult,
							profane obscenity and filth— These are indexes to the various estimation
							in which I am held in the free and servile sections of this Union—
							Indexes to the moral sensibilities of free, and of Slavery tainted
							communities. Threats of Lynching and Assassination, are the natural
							offspring of Slave-breeders and Slave-traders—profanity and obscenity
							are their natural associates;—such dross the fire must purge— But the
							perpetual calls for autographs and Album scraps, are scarcely less
							annoying in another way— They set in motion the rhyming maggot in my
							brain and breed swarms of May flies as prolific as the dead herrings
							that line the banks of the Potomac.— I laboured with an abortion upon
							Faith this morning, and with another anti belligerent speech, on this
							navy-appropriation bill. At the house, after a struggle by <persRef

							Claims pleading for the devotion of this day to private business, the
							house at <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore’s</persRef> motion
							decided by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>to go into Committee of the whole on

								>Cushing</persRef> had the floor from yesterday and made an
							elaborate speech of two hours in defence of the administration, and of
							the <persRef ref="upshur-abel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> and his
							report— His argument as usual was captious and sophistical; attempting
							to shew that the Secretary’s plan did not urge a present increase of the
							Navy; but that <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> were contending for a
							decrease of the existing navy— Cushing affects to be the leader of the
							administration members, and is much flattered when recognized by the
							whigs and democrats, as a Cabinet Minister, of the white house in petto:
							as was done by M’Kay and Meriwether, in replying to him this day; which
							they did with great earnestness. <persRef ref="parmenter-william"

							with the request— I still believe that it was intended for, and felt to

							Bills, for the relief of John A. Smith of the legal representatives of
							Daniel Brent, and of Edwin Bartlett, which were read twice, ordered to
							be printed and referred to the whole house on the state of the Union—
							The house then went into that committee, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> in the chair upon the army appropriation bill—
							On the first item of appropriation being for the pay of the army
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved a reduction
							of 305,700 dollars, or about one fifth of the amount— Meriwether moved a

							which the Chairman decided not to be in order, whereupon Cave Johnson
							withdrew his amendment to reduce the amount of pay, and moved an
							amendment providing that no part of the appropriation should be applied
							to pay Officers hereafter appointed hereafter appointed or soldiers
							enlisted till the army shall number not more than 5000 men— <persRef
								ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> objected to the amendment
							as not in order— The chairman decided that it was— <persRef
								ref="morgan-christopher">Morgan</persRef> took an appeal too late,
							and I moved an amendment to that of Cave Johnson by substituting the
							standard of the act of 1821. 6000 men, instead of 5000 which Cave
							Johnson accepted. And now the debate for the reduction of the army
							commenced. <persRef ref="butler-william2">W. O. Butler</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef>, Fillmore, and <persRef

							and <persRef ref="campbell-william2">W. B. Campbell</persRef>,
							supporting the amendment. Sharp altercation between <persRef
								ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of Georgia and Granger upon a
							heavy charge by Black against the army; who were vigorously defended by

							army.— <persRef ref="thompson-richard">Thompson</persRef> of Indiana and
								<persRef ref="allen-elisha">Elisha H. Allen</persRef> stiffly

								Leavitt</persRef> called on me this morning, with a young Quaker
							from Philadelphia named <persRef ref="u">Miller</persRef> who was here
							last Summer during the extra Session, and who now brought me a kind
							remembrance from <persRef ref="webb-samuel2">Samuel Webb</persRef>.—
							Morning call also from <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef>, Auditor of the
							General Post Office, with <persRef ref="u">his son</persRef> of whom he
							introduced to me— In the house it had yesterday been agreed that the
							Committees should be called for reports this morning, which was done.
							Among the reports made by <persRef ref="cowen-benjamin">Cowen</persRef>,
							chairman of the Committee of Claims was a joint resolution from the
							Senate for a rule to take from claimants the right of reproducing claims
							which have been once rejected, unless with a certificate from a member
							of Congress, that he believes the claim to be just.— I objected to this
							addition to the joint rules, and protested against it, as restrictive
							upon the right of petition, which I considered as peculiarly requiring
							the observance and respect of the house with regard to claims against
							the Government for the satisfaction of which has no resort to the
							judicial tribunals. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>
							moved to make the Resolution the special order of the day for next
							Friday week; but could not carry a vote of two thirds and it lies over.
							Numerous other reports of Committees were made, and among the rest
								<persRef ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef> from the
							Committee on the public expenditures, made a detailed and thorough
							retrenchment report, with four bills, cutting deep into the army, the

							expenses in the collection of duties on imports— I renewed the motion,
							by direction of the Committee of foreign Affairs, to fix a day, the
								31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month to consider the
							French claim Bill— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> called

							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> in the chair, upon the Army Bill— M’Kay resumed his
							argument, and offered an amendment as a substitute for that of Cave
							Johnson, which Johnson accepted.— M’Kay proposed to reduce the numbers
							of men in the artillery and infantry regiments to the standard of the
							act of 2. March 1821. 42 men to each company; and to disband the second
							Regiment of dragoons, or to melt it up into a regiment of riflemen.—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> objected to

							them were made— One from retrenchment Gilmer about pay-mileage and
							franking.— One from <persRef ref="clark-john">John C. Clark</persRef>

						<p>I rose soon after 5, and found <persRef ref="irwin-william">M<hi

							is a Paradise in the wild, under his cultivation. The house was
							surrounded by trees, which were alive with the music of mocking-birds

						<p>While the house was in session yesterday, a subpoena from the United

							and <persRef ref="rives-john">Rives</persRef>, publishers of the Globe,
							for a libel.— I went immediately to the City Hall and found the Court in

							were asked of me by the counsel of the parties— They related to the
							manner in which Doctor Mayo, had communicated to me his Letter to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> of

									>r</hi> Hassler</persRef> called on me this morning, full, as

							head was appointed on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February
							to overhaul his expenses and proceedings relating both to the coast

								<persRef ref="aycrigg-john">Aycrigg</persRef> persecute him, and he
							says that Aycrigg’s motive is to quarter <persRef ref="u">a

							papers—one a Letter from Mallory, chairman of the Committee of 12. March
							last to the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> communicating
							Resolutions of enquiry adopted by the Committee, and requesting an early
							answer— The other, a remonstrance by Hassler against the Limitation of
							the works for the Coast survey supposed to be contemplated by the
							Committee. At the house, the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> presented a Letter from <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C. Winthrop</persRef>, announcing 25.
							May 1842. that on account of serious illness in his family he had

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gaetano Castiglia</persRef>, a

								ref="cutts-mary">Mary Cutts</persRef> to the Representative Hall
							where <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maffitt</persRef> preached, from Philippians 3.20. [“]For our
							conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the
							Lord Jesus Christ; 21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be
							fashioned, like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby
							he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.” The subject was the
							resurrection—too capacious for the grasp and too weighty for the poise
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt.— The resurrection of the
							body, is the profoundest mystery of the Christian religion, and the most
							difficult article of the Christian faith— The perishable or corruptible
							property of matter seems to be so inseparable from it that imperishable
							or immortal matter is an incredible confusion of words— <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> pronounces
							the man who enquires with what body the dead shall rise, a fool—but he
							says too that the body that shall rise is not the same body that shall
							have died— He says that there is a spiritual body and a natural body.—
							The body that dies is vile—the body that shall rise is glorious— Behold,
							says the Apostle, I shew you a mystery.— And a mystery it remains and
							will remain, till it shall please almighty wisdom to reveal more of his
							eternal counsels to man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt enlarged
							much upon the usual argument for the resurrection from analogy— The
							blade of grass, the blossom and the leaf—and above all the
							transformations of the insect tribes— He described with more minuteness
							than precision the metamorphosis of a grub into a butterfly which he
							said he had accidentally witnessed for the first time last Spring.— He
							gave also several of the passages from the old Testament which seem to
							countenance the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the immortality of
							the soul—particularly the passage from <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>—
							I know that my redeemer liveth—but not the remarkable passage in the
							book of Ecclesiastes— Or ever the silver cord be loosened— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Maffitt gave notice that divine service
							would be performed in the Representative hall, next Sunday morning, but
							not that he himself would preach— I was prevented from attending public
							worship this afternoon, by a very heavy thundergust which came up from 4
							to 6 O’Clock, precisely at the time of meeting at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— I employed the time in
							partly redeeming the arrears in this diary occasioned by the evening at
								<persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General Jesup’s</persRef>—the next days
							dinner, and the wedding party at Sharon.</p>

						<p>I have written some lines at the request of <persRef ref="king-thomas2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Butler King</persRef>, a
							member of the house from Georgia, for <persRef ref="low-annie">Miss
								Annie Low</persRef>, a young Lady of whose name I never heard
							before; but who M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King assures me is
							handsome, sensible and amiable— This morning I attended the meeting of
							the Committee of foreign Affairs—present Adams, <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Granger</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef>, Granger, <persRef
								ref="white-edward">White</persRef> and <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>— Absent <persRef ref="stuart-alexander2"
								>Stuart</persRef> and <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine"
								>Shepperd</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caruthers had
							prepared in part a report upon the resolution of the house relating to
							the allowances claimed in the accounts of <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">Cornelius P. Van Ness</persRef> during a
							service of seven years from 1829 to 1836. as Envoy Extraordinary and
							Minister Plenipotentiary in Spain— Caruthers approves some of the
							claims, and is for disallowing others.— There are seven items of charge
							disallowed by the auditor of the State Department, and questioned by the
							Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="hawes-richard">Hawes</persRef> to
							the last Congress and by <persRef ref="triplett-philip"
								>Triplett</persRef> to the present— The Committee agreed to allow
							two or three of the charges and postponed the consideration of the
							remainder.— In the house, <persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of
							Mississippi, offered a resolution, that on Monday next and for the rest
							of the Session the hour of meeting of the house shall be 10. A.M.
							adopted— At <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth">Rayner’s</persRef> motion
							10000 copies of <persRef ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy’s</persRef> colonial
							commerce report were ordered to be printed— I presented the petition of
								<persRef ref="willis-william3">William Willis</persRef>, which was
							referred to the Committee of Revolutionary claims— Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> in the Chair upon the army appropriation bill—
								<persRef ref="mckeon-john">M’Keon</persRef> resumed his speech
							demagogical, rhetorical, classical, and sophistical for almost two
							hours— <persRef ref="fessenden-william">Fessenden</persRef> of Maine
							made a very handsome speech against any reduction of the army; referring
							to my remarks against the increase of the army and declaring his dissent
							from them. It was a spirited and powerful speech— Then came a pitched
							battle between <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="warren-lott">Warren</persRef> of Georgia, remarkable for the
							contrast of temper between faggot fire and steady flame; <persRef
								ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef>, made a steam-engine-explosion in
							honour of the army, and against any reduction, till half past 4. when
								<persRef ref="halstead-william">Halsted</persRef> took the floor,
							the Committee rose and the house adjourned— <persRef ref="adams-joseph"
								>Joseph H. Adams</persRef> dined with us, and we had sundry evening
							visitors. We had all received invitations to an evening party at
								<persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sewall’s</persRef>—the hour of meeting being 9. p.m— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> had made all her
							arrangements to leave us to-morrow morning, and <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;smith-catherine-johnson">our
								Ladies</persRef> all declined to go—but I went— It was a numerous
							and crowded company— <persRef ref="parker-peter">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> China Parker</persRef> and <persRef ref="parker-harriet">his
								wife</persRef> were there—<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison</persRef>—<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">A. Stevenson</persRef> and
							many. I took <persRef ref="gamble-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gamble</persRef> of Georgia and <persRef ref="gamble-margaret">his
							daughter</persRef> home on Capitol hill—</p>
