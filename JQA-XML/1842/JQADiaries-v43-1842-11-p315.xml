						<p>My Thermometer at Sun-rise was 10 degrees higher than it has been for
							several preceding days. Yet there was a white frost on the ground
							indicating that the rise in the thermometer above the freezing point had
							taken place since midnight— It continued to rise till Sunset when it was
							about 50— <persRef key="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> took <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Catherine</persRef> with him into Boston
							to pass three days at <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef>—and He with
							his family are to remove into Boston for the winter on Thursday—and
							Mary-Louisa, is to remain with them till Saturday. I received by the
							mail this morning proof half sheets 4 and 5. of my reception
							speech—revised the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and sent it back by
							my son—then the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which on my way to
							Hingham I stop’d and left at the Post-Office. We dined at one, and just
							as we were departing <persRef ref="judson-andrew">Andrew T.
								Judson</persRef>, judge of the District Court of the United States
							for the District of Connecticut, came to pay me a visit. He was a member
							of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress, and with me of the
							Committee of manufactures. In 1836. during the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> Session of that Congress he was appointed by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> Judge of the
							District Court of Connecticut and has held that office ever since. His
							firmness in the case of the Amistad Africans, though his opinion was not
							altogether consistent with itself probably saved their lives and their
							Liberty. I regretted very much that he came just at the moment when I
							was obliged to go, and could not even suspend my departure half an hour.
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> went with me,
							and we alighted at <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Loring’s</persRef> house just at 3. He was married the
							week before last, to a <persRef ref="loring-amelia">miss
								Fudger</persRef> of Dorchester, and his house in bridal trim— The
							time for the lecture had been fixed at half past three. <persRef
								ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Richardson</persRef> the Minister of the parish, walked with us to
							the old meeting house, and introduced me to his pulpit— It was a quarter
							before 4 when I commenced, and after reading an hour I found the light
							fading so that I could no longer follow my manuscript— As the darkness
							increased I skip’d over paragraphs and then whole pages, without waiting
							to discriminate, but dashing through, and not seeming to be embarrassed—
							I barely made out to read the last two paragraphs, and came off as well,
							as if I had read the whole. We then returned to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r </hi>Loring’s— He had invited a party to tea of about 30<hi
								rend="superscript"> </hi>ladies and gentlemen our relatives and
							friends— It was a conversation, which I should have been glad to
							protract, had not too much of it been assigned to me— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson and others asked successively
							several questions apparently for the express purpose of making me talk;
							and I was perhaps not altogether wise in suffering myself thus to get
							drawn out— I took an early opportunity to get out— We left the company
							at 7. and reached home shortly before 8. Found <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> at <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>our</persRef> house, and he soon after came in. She was unwell,
							just before they left us to go home.</p>

						<p>There was a threatening of foul weather this morning and thick clouds
							over the Sun till near noon when they dispersed, and a clear sky and
							chilly atmosphere followed— I received the 6<hi rend="superscript"

							revised it, and took it to the Post-Office, with answers to invitation
							Letters received also this morning from <persRef

								ref="silsbee-nathaniel">Nath<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef> of Salem, and <persRef ref="brown-george2">George
								Brown</persRef> of Beverly— I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef>, heretofore a member of
							Congress from Maine; afterwards a <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>Harrison</persRef> whig and lastly the caucus candidate for the
							Office of Clerk to the present House of Representatives; beaten in
							competition with <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clarke</persRef>. He was
							accompanied by a friend from Boston, whose name he mentioned but
							articulated so indistinctly that I could not retain it. <persRef
								ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef> with
							her aunt <persRef ref="u">Miss Pearson</persRef> visited here but I did
							not see them. She said M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Lunt was going
							this Evening to Milton to hear my Lecture— At half past five I went
							first to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s house to take him up, but
							he was not there, or no one heard my knocking at the door, so that I
							went to Milton alone. I found easily <persRef ref="angier-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Angier’s</persRef> house— He
							was at tea, with <persRef ref="angier-elizabeth">his wife</persRef>, and
							two chubby boys of <persRef ref="angier-william;angier-josephine">2 and
								4 years old</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Angier is a
							beautiful woman whom he married while he was minister at New Bedford— At
							a quarter past 7. they both went with me to the Lyceum hall, about a
							mile distant, and I delivered my Lecture on Society and civilization
							with some omissions which abridged it within a compass of an hour— The
							hall was crowded—the attention of the audience unremitted and the
							delivery unobstructed, as I took the precaution to have two additional
							lamps brought in and placed at the sides of the desk before which I
							stood. After the lecture, <persRef ref="forbes-john5">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Forbes</persRef> came and spoke
							to me, and enquired if I should deliver another Lecture upon China which
							I told him I should not; having no time to prepare one. I returned with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Angier to his house, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes his
							next door neighbour sent me an Evening Newspaper containing the news
							received by the Steamer<space/>which arrived this morning from Liverpool,
							whence she sailed on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last Month.
							The average passage of these Steamers during the Summer months is now
							fourteen days— The only news of importance, received by the Steamer is
							the ratification in England of the Ashburton Treaty; after much more
							severe censure upon it in the English newspapers, than it has had to
							encounter here— I reached home just at 10. O’Clock, and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> immediately
							after, went home— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> had gone just
							before— I got thus through the day much better than I had feared this
							morning when for upwards of an hour sharp pains in my left eye
							threatened me with an inflammation, and my hoarseness with a failure of
							my voice.</p>

							stating that the amount of the sum in the treasury was upwards of 4000

							Letter, and asked my advice, what he should do— I supposed the sum had

						<p>I took a small chest with me from home for a change of linen and writing
							materials and carelessly put into it my small inkstand enclosed in a tin
							box— Last Night on opening the chest to take out my night cap and
							flannel night gown I found that every drop of ink had oozed out of the
							little wedgewood stand, through the tin box, and stained through the
							right shoulder of one of my shirts— Some small portion of it had also
							blackened the edges of a sheet of writing paper, and had done no other
							damage— Not a drop of ink was left in the stand; and I was obliged to
							give up my intention of writing before breakfast— Immediately after that
								<persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Saltonstall</persRef> went with me to a barber’s shop, where I was
							shaved and had my hair cut— <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen C. Phillips</persRef> soon
							came, and we visited the public schools. The Classical school, for
							teaching Greek and Latin. The English high school. The common schools
							for boys and girls from 4 to 16. years of age— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Phillips was 3 years Mayor of Salem and gave his whole
							Salary to the city at the end of the term for the improvement of the
							schools. We heard the boys recite in Greek. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Phillips gave me a Salem Register of 11. July last
							containing a description of the manner in which these two schools the
							grammar and high schools are constructed, fitted up, and furnished— It
							is curious in the highest degree, but I have neither time nor space to
							describe it— <persRef ref="mann-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Horace</persRef> the Secretary of the School commissioners of the

							publication of a common school Journal, has spur’d on the zeal for the

							</hi>Philips has caught the inspiration, and is labouring with great
							perseverance to carry into practical execution M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Mann’s projected improvements. There are now 2500 children, at the
							public schools here in a population of 15000— Among the studies here
							introduced is that of singing chorus, and by the notes, pinn’d up on the
							side of the wall— This visitation took us three hours— Returning to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall’s house we met at the door an
							old man, who asked me, if I remembered his face— I did not— It was
								<persRef ref="poland-nathan">Nathan Poland</persRef> first mate of
							the ship Horace <persRef ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain Benjamin
								Beckford</persRef>, with whom in August 1809. I went to Russia— I
							asked him if he would have known me again he said no— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall asked him into his house, and
							he sat with me an hour and enquired about every individual who was with
							me on that voyage; and telling many incidents which occurred on the
							voyage. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall had invited a small
							party to dinner, among whom were my old Classmate <persRef

								<persRef ref="brown-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

							Neither was he there— At the Office of the <persRef ref="bigelow-john"

							The documents of the last Session of the Legislature are not yet ready.—
							At <persRef ref="curtis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George T.

							This deposition was taken a year ago, but on account of some informality
							could not be admitted. The interrogatories were the same as before, but
							I had not my former answers to refresh my memory. My next call was at
							the Emancipator Office where I had long conversation with <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="paley-william">Paley’s</persRef> Horae Paulinae, might be drawn
							out upon a much more comprehensive plan— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt did not enlarge upon the personal character, genius, temper or
							adventures of Paul— In expatiating on this testimonial to the violence
							of his zeal, passions and prejudices before his conversion, he confined
							himself chiefly to reflections on the unaccountable infatuation of the
							spirit which can inflame itself into hatred of such doctrines as compose
							the fundamental parts of the Christian Religion— The being and
							attributes of God— The immortality of the Soul— The law of mutual love
							and universal benevolence— A bigot of atheism! There is no basement
							story to that edifice— If true, its conclusions are cruelty, treachery,
							and despair.— Degrand left us about 7. O’Clock and returned to Boston— I
							wrote and sent by him a Letter to <persRef ref="wild-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Wilde</persRef> of Brookline,
							offering to go there on Tuesday or Friday next as will best suit them to
							the Lecture-delivery before the Lyceum; and requesting that they would
							send a Carriage to my house to take me there and home— My conversations
							yesterday with <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">Leavitt</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="stanton-henry">Stanton</persRef>, and afterwards with
								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Abbott Lawrence</persRef> have
							aggravated the pressure on my mind and spirits almost beyond endurance.
							At the very closing stage of life, I have staked my good name and
							character upon an issue the result of which depends on a Providence
							dubious in its designs and inscrutable in its ways of bringing good out
							of evil— I can have no reliance but upon myself on Earth and upon God in
							Heaven— My barque is on the wave, and the polar star is in the sky.

							I could not positively engage, but promised to come, if I could possibly

								ref="gill-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gill</persRef> the
							book-binder to be bound. But I have not been able to assort about 50

							unbroken— Since 1. June 1839. there is no chasm; a page a day and rarely
							two pages have been my continual task; but the keeping of a diary that I

							fall short of one third of a page— Each volume to contain the record of
							4. years— In 60 years this would make 15 volumes of 500 pages each—quite
							enough for the autobiography of one man.— I have already more volumes
							and multitudes of fragments— Trash inexpressible which I pray to God may
							never be exposed; but which I leave to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my

						<p>A North-east storm this day closed a continued spell of beautiful weather
							of six weeks duration— Clear days; cool nights with an average of
								<persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> thermometer
							at 40 at Sunrise; Not more than 5 days have been crystal clear from the
							rising to the setting Sun— Rain has not fallen on more than 3 days of
							45. and only once to continue 8 hours— Many Mornings a low cloud
							bordering the horizon from East to South has intercepted the sight of
							the Sun at his rising when the whole firmament beside was clear. I take
							these clouds to be exhalations raised by the Sun from the surface of the
							Sea, and that they always rise with an atmosphere from the freezing
							point to 50 of Fahrenheit.— The storm of this day has been preceded by
							four or five days of Indian Summer—Warm Sunny days—Nights with
							Fahrenheit from 30 to 50. the Sun rising invisible in thick haze, but
							appearing in deep crimson colour within five or ten minutes after
							rising.— At Sunrise this morning, the sky was overcast—the thermometer
							at 50—the wind S.E. almost calm, and the feeling of the air warm— It
							soon began to sprinkle, then to rain, and the wind veering to the East
							and North-east, and freshening till by 10. O’Clock it became a chilling
							Northeast storm: <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pierce</persRef> of Brookline nevertheless came to
							inform me that <persRef ref="wild-charles">D<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> took to Boston Sunday Evening,
							and that next Friday evening will suit them better for the delivery of

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house N. 57. Mount
							Vernon Street Boston next Friday at 4. p.m where they will have a
							Carriage ready to take me to Brookline, and to bring me home after the
							Lecture, which commences at 7. I asked D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pierce to stay and dine with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef> but he said he was engaged and went off in the midst
							of the storm— My Son came out from Boston with <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>; he dined with us, and
							returned after dinner to Boston. I was engaged all day in retrieving the
							arrears of last weeks diary; and in answering a Letter from <persRef
								ref="baldwin-life">Life Baldwin</persRef>, corresponding Secretary
							of the Brighton Lyceum inviting me in behalf of the Directors of that
							Society to deliver a Lecture before them. This one of a multitude of
							such Letters which have remained nearly three weeks unanswered— I
							propose next Saturday or the Thursday after— This evening we were again
							all engaged in directing and franking copies of my pamphlet reception
							speech to one inhabitant of each town—of the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> present Congregational District, and of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> District under the new apportionment,
							together with a copy of the report of the Tariff veto— The rest of the

						<p>I was obliged to lie in bed nearly two hours after I awoke this morning
							for want of means to occupy my time with reading or writing— That is to
							say for want of a lamp, a fire, a table, and an inkstand—for these wants
							I ought in traveling to be always provided— I rose however just before
							the Sun, the sky having in the course of the night cleared away, cold—
							Seven or eight gentlemen breakfasted with us at <persRef
								ref="lawrence-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence’s
							</persRef>by his invitation—among whom I remember only <persRef
								ref="ames-seth">Seth Ames</persRef> a son of <persRef

								>Warren</persRef> a son of <persRef ref="warren-henry5">Henry

								ref="lawrence-henry;lawrence-george">two sons 5 and 3 years of

								ref="lawrence-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> immediately after their marriage, at
							Philadelphia, on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1833—
							They lost <persRef ref="lawrence-charles">one son</persRef> last winter
							by the scarlet fever— I was much edified this morning by their family
							worship—in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence read a psalm,
							and made a short appropriate prayer— Among a number of handsome books he
							shewed me <persRef ref="horne-thomas">Cantwell Horne’s</persRef>
							Landscape Illustrations of the Bible, in two octavo Volumes with
							numerous beautiful engravings and descriptions, from recent travellers
							in Palestine.— After breakfast M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Lawrence
							took me round the city now of upwards of 20,000 souls, which I had last
							visited on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1827. when
							the population of the place was not more than 5000. The factory which we
							then visited was of cotton goods—that which we inspected this day was of
							woolen broad-cloaths and Cassimers— Much of the machinery is the same—
							The spinning, weaving, fulling, and dyeing processes are performe on
							separate floors of the building. Far the greater number of the
							operatives are young unmarried women of whom M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lawrence says there are 9000, working 12 hours a day all the

								ref="lawrence-william5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

							the democratic candidate for the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							district for election to Congress— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb

							convention would nominate him he would decline; which was done— We
							reached Boston by two—but the hackman whom I engaged to take me to
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, took in
							with me such lots of other passengers whom he landed at their homes,
							that I was nearly as long in reaching 57 Mount Vernon street as I had
							been in coming from Lowell to the depot— at 3 quarters past 2. I found
							Charles and his family at dinner, and had little more time than to dine
							and ride to the Eastern rail road depot and take the Cars for Lynn—
								<persRef ref="buffum-arnold">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Buffum</persRef> was at the depot and took me to his house, where I

						<p>This morning I was enabled to rise at my accustomed hour, and to write in
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef> library and Study
							two hours before breakfast— The time that I have left upon earth is so
							short, that every morning lost is a calamity. After breakfast I went to

							358. Washington Street, and found my inkstand in a new tin box— I then
							went to visit <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							me to dine with him on thanksgiving day, if I should remain here so

							particularly the last one which I never read. At <persRef
								ref="poole-lott">Poole</persRef> the Tailor’s I ordered a surtout, a

							week, and for which I pray I may be prepared. <persRef

							had sent me a pamphlet, entitled the Andover husking. I enquired who was

							claimed as a Slave by <persRef ref="gray-james3">James G. Gray</persRef>
							of Richmond, Virginia— The affair is taking a turn which will produce

							with another revolting case of a coloured man a native of Virginia, but
							a mariner and serving in a New England vessel, struck with a palsy— And
							the captain of the vessel arrested at Richmond, and laid under bonds for
							procuring an Agent to land the coloured man, for medical treatment to
							his disease— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"

							house, and then at his house where I found him laid up with a lame foot—

								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came out from
							Boston, and dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

								<persRef ref="allen-joseph3">Joseph H. Allen</persRef>, the student
							at the Divinity school at Cambridge, Grandson of <persRef

							the <persRef ref="allen-joseph4">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Joseph Allen</persRef> of Northborough— The same who recently
							brought me a recommendatory Letter from <persRef ref="francis-convers"
								>Professor Convers Francis</persRef>. Some days since he sent me his
							Album with a request that I would write some lines in it— I had not done
							it for mere want of time; but I now copied into it, a Sonnet upon the
							Morning Star— He had walked here from Cambridge this morning, and
							immediately after dinner he left us to walk in the midst of the rain
							without Great Coat or Umbrella to Boston— I received as usual a number
							of Letters, requesting me to deliver Lectures in sundry places, and
							among them one from <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Joseph L.
								Tillinghast</persRef> of Providence Rhode-Island—requesting a copy
							of my Lecture upon Democracy for publication— This has occasioned no
							small embarrassment in my mind, for the topic is as sharp with quills as
							the fretful porcupine; and the same opinions, which have been very
							favourably received here may be very obnoxious there— I need a guiding
							Spirit as much as I ever did at any period of my life— My present
							position is one of great popularity with a falling party; and in falling
							with them the prospect for me is of a sudden, and overwhelming reverse
							in which case persecution may come not only upon myself which I can bear
							with fortitude, but upon those to whom my good name is not only dear but
							necessary for their comfort. I have deliberately assumed an aggressive
							position against the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>, and
							his whole executive Administration—against the Supreme Court of the
							United States, and against the <persRef ref="scott-winfield">commander
								in chief of the army</persRef>— I am at issue with all the organized
							powers, of the Union—with the twelve hundred millions of dollars of
							associated wealth, and with all the rabid democracy of the land. I do
							not mistake my position, nor disguise to myself its perils— But my cause
							is the cause of my Country, and of human liberty. It is the cause of
							Christian improvement—the fulfilment of the prophesies, that the day
							shall come when Slavery and War shall be banished from the face of the
							Earth.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="stearns-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stearns</persRef> of Hingham, preached this morning, from John
							12.48. “He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
							judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
							the last day.” From the tenour of this chapter it seems apparent that
							the resurrection of <persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> from the
							dead was the immediate cause of the conspiracy of the pharisees, which
							terminated in the crucifixion— The impression made upon the minds of the
							people was so great that the pharisees saw their only chance to save
							their institutions was to put Jesus to death as an imposter and Lazarus
							as his accomplice— In the discourse of which the text forms a part he
							announces so obscurely as not to be understood by his disciples his own
							approaching death—speaks of it in a tone at once of dejection and of
							confidence; illustrates his condition by the analogy of vegetation to
							the growth of which the death of the seed is indispensable; and
							earnestly dwells upon the averment that he does and can do nothing of
							himself, but all as he is commanded by his father— The text is a calm
							self collected threat of the final judgment of God against those who
							rejected him. The struggle between the spreading belief in Christ, and
							the worldly and religious influences against it, are painted in glowing
							colours in the apostles’ narrative. The transactions occurred only three
							or four days before the crucifixion— I invited M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Stearns to dine with us, but he was previously engaged by
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef>. As I was returning home from Meeting I stop’d in
							at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my sons</persRef> house and took out
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">Lowrie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew">Clark’s</persRef> American State papers
							containing the Instructions, from the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State James Monroe</persRef> to the American
							Commissioners for Peace dated 15. April 1813—I found them p. 697. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns’s afternoon text was Luke 9.25.
							“For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose
							himself, or be cast away?” This passage is with a various reading in
							Matthew 16.26. and Mark 8.35–36. The stress upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Stearns’s discourse was, the wretchedness of an accusing
							conscience even in the midst of the highest worldly prosperity— The
							subject is susceptible of much impressive detail and was well managed by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stearns; but in a manner very
							different from that of the young graduates from the Divinity school at
							Cambridge— I read last evening and this morning <persRef
								ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Ellery
								Channing’s</persRef> last words and dying testimonial against
							Slavery. The address delivered at Lenox on the first of August last the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Anniversary day of the abolition of
							Slavery in the British West India Colonies. It is the most powerful and
							enthusiastic of all his writings, and if it could fall upon a soil
							worthy of the seed would yield an abundant harvest—at least an hundred
							fold— <persRef ref="buffum-arnold">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Buffum</persRef> gave me a copy of it last week at Lynn— <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> read to us this evening
							the chapter on Washington city of <persRef ref="dickens-charles"
								>Dickins’s</persRef> notes on America.</p>

							controul for a grateful heart, to feel and acknowledge all his
							blessings; for humble resignation to his will, and submission to his
							chastisements— I believe myself sincere but the heart is deceitful above
							all things and desperately wished I do not believe the total depravity
							of man, but I am deeply conscious of the frailty of my own nature— Jesus
							Christ went about doing good—I would do the same— The spirit is willing

							triumphant fraudulent and reckless democracy— A severe trial awaits us
							both; and I trust will be the last of my political struggles upon earth—
							Never throughout my life have I stood more in need of the merciful and
							controuling hand of omnipotent goodness to direct my path— The prospect
							before me is all but hopeless— I have no encouragement to expect the
							accomplishment—all that it can be possible to affect may be the
							prevention of some evil— Heaven will at last vindicate its own justice
							by producing good out of evil—but not in my time— I wrote this day under
							great depression of drowsiness and devoted the whole evening to
							directing and franking 45 copies of my reception pamphlet address; with
							copies of the Oration of 4. July 1837 at Newburyport, of the tariff
							speech of 9. May 1840; of the speech on <persRef ref="mcleod-alexander"

							rose a thick fog— I wrote the diary of yesterday—finished a Letter to
							the Editors of the Boston Atlas, containing a correction of the
							statement made in my reception address that the commander in chief of
							the army, <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> is a
							Slaveholder. His sensitiveness to the imputation is a signal
							demonstration of the pungency of the general statement— He is a native
							of Virginia, and a very favorable specimen of the tribe— I inferred of
							course that he was a Slave holder, without reflecting that in his
							military capacity his life has been almost entirely spent in the free
							States, where he could not hold Slaves— His Letter has given me an
							opportunity at once to acknowledge the error of my statement respecting
							him, and to show that it is perfectly immaterial to the argument for
							which I adduced it, and also to touch again upon a Northern nerve, in a
							torpid state, to see if it cannot be quickened into sensation— I wrote
							also a notification to all the Lyceums, literary and political
							associations from which I have received invitations, to deliver before
							them Orations Lectures or Addresses, to apologize, with a grateful sense
							of their favours, for my inability not only to comply with their
							invitations, but even to answer the Letters in which they were conveyed—
							And I wrote to <persRef ref="fuller-george">George Fuller</persRef>,
							that I would meet him next Monday at the Office of the judge of probate
							in this City. After breakfast, I paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison Gray
								Otis</persRef>, an acquaintance of nearly 60 years—long a
							self-constituted political rival and competitor—prosperous throughout
							life, in the pursuit, acquisition, and enjoyment of wealth, and now
							voluntarily retired from all public life, tortured from time to time by
							the gout but retaining a cheerful, gay, lively temper of mind, the most
							favourable perhaps of all to longevity— We talked of old times—not much
							of politics, but he told me, in confidence, of a greasy colloquial scene
							in the year 1816. which he witnessed between <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Philip Barbour</persRef> the logician, and the
							lamented <persRef ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef>— My next
							visit was to <persRef ref="sears-david2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								David Sears</persRef>, who lives in the most magnificent, and most
							superbly furnished house in Boston, perhaps in the United States—
							Pictures, marble Statues, enamelled tables and splendid carpets and
							curtains, proclaim the abode rather of a European Prince than of a plain
							republican— Yet M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sears is not happy. He
							seldom resides in his palace, but strolls about the world residing at
							taverns and hotels.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sears recently left
							a card for me at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> house,
							after at least fifteen years of unremembered acquaintance, and his
							reception of my return visit was very kind and cordial. I returned also
							the card visit of <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef>, but he was not at home. I left the Letter for
							George Fuller at the Post-Office— The Letter rectifying the error of
							imputing to General Scott the character of a Slave holder, and the
							notification to Lyceums, and literary associations with <persRef
								ref="hayden-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayden</persRef>
							at the Atlas Office—had an interview with <persRef
								ref="buckingham-joseph">Joseph T. Buckingham</persRef> at his
							Office, and at 4. this afternoon came out in <persRef ref="gillet-simon"
								>Gillet’s</persRef> stage to Quincy. <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann
								Beale</persRef> were in the same Stage.</p>

							after dinner returned— I had also a morning visit from an ex-inhabitant
							of the common jail, after a residence of 10 years upon a sentence for 12

							has made him The Tom Fool of King Demus. He has taken to be a Saint in

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 24. Bitter cold. Cloudless sky The first beam appeared close
							at the left side of the temple steeple’s belfry; and rising passed
							behind it, clearing the right had pillar in five minutes, with his lower
							limb about half a disk above the horizon. The whole day was cloudless,
							with a stiff north western breeze, neutralizing the heat of the Sun, so
							that the feeling of the air was keen— <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> morning text was from
							Matthew 28.8. “And they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with fear
							and great joy”— After adverting cursorily, and very superficially to the
							historical narrative of this stupendous incident, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s discourse was an ingenious
							dissertation upon fear and joy as co-ingredients of the genuine
							christian temper— But joy and fear are passions so adverse in their
							nature to each other, that they can exist in union only under extreme
							agitation of mind. How exquisitely joyous, and yet how awfully fearful
							must it have been to the <persRef ref="mary;marymagdalen">two
								Marys</persRef> on coming to the sepulchre of him whom they had two
							days before seen crucified, to meet an earthquake and an angel, rolling
							away the stone from the door of the Sepulchre, and telling them that
							Jesus was no longer there— Then immediately after seeing Jesus himself
							and receiving his commands to go and tell his disciples to go and meet
							him in Galilee—Oh!—how many deaths would it be the summit of bliss to
							endure for such a vision! The afternoon sermon was from Numbers 35.31.
							“Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,
							which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.”— This
							was an argument to prove the necessity of capital punishment for murder,
							a question at this time very earnestly controverted, and upon which the
							spreading opinion of Christendom is for its abolition of the punishment
							of death. My own mind is strongly verging to that conclusion against the
							bent of my earliest impressions— My own experience of four years during
							which I possessed the power of remitting that penalty, and once or twice
							felt it my duty to suffer the execution of the Law, all but wrought
							conviction upon me tha the life of man should never be taken by the arm
							of the Law— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s sermon is occasional—
							A man named <persRef ref="colt-john">Colt</persRef> was under sentence
							of death for a very atrocious murder, and should have been executed last
							Friday at New-York— But he killed himself by a stab with a knife through
							the heart;—There are many nauseously romantic incidents connected with
							this case, which <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf</persRef> told me, as
							we were walking over the hill homeward this after-noon— <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> were here, after meeting. I spent the Evening
							in addressing packets of speeches and addresses to my Constituents; and
							also the returns of Commerce and Navigation for 1841.— Eve of

							are permanent points annually for the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							of November and of January: and by repeated observation would alone
							suffice to ascertain the number of days in a solar year. As usual my
							packing up was in utter confusion both as to what books and papers I
							take away, and to those I leave behind— I sent two trunks into Boston by
								<persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillett’s</persRef> stage, and took a
							third with me, in the carriage, driven by <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
								Kirk</persRef>. My Cousin <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.

							winter at <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">her sister’s</persRef>,—wife
							of <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster</persRef>— Immediately after alighting at my son’s house, and
							sending Kirk with the Carriage and horses back to Quincy, I went to

								ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

								ref="gill-moses">Moses Gill</persRef>, and his counsel, <persRef
								ref="washburn-emory">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Washburn</persRef> of Worcester. They were desirous of coming to a
							settlement between the two administrations, but the same obstacle
							remained which had prevented a settlement in November 1839— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller still objected to allowing the
							offset of the note from Moses Gill to <persRef ref="boylston-alicia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef> of 5. Jan<hi

							deduction from the amount to be paid over from me, as administrator de
							bonis non of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>
							to him as Administrator of Moses Gill— But as my Assets consist entirely
							of shares in the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, which from 117
							dollars a share at which rate I received them in June 1839. have sunk
							down to be worth not more than 2 or 3 dollars a share, we agreed that
							there was nothing left for the parties to contend about— I promised to
							advise M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston to relinquish her claim
							for the offset of the note and then to transfer to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller the Bank stock at 117. dollars a
							share to cover his whole claim as the administrator of Moses Gill— After
							this I called at the Office of the Emancipator, N. 32. Washington
							Street, and saw <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Leavitt</persRef>. I mentioned to him the Instructions

							to the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> Manifesto
							concerning the pretended derivative right of impresment of British
							Seamen on board of American Merchant vessels; and considered the
							argument strictly applicable to the pretended derivative right of
							holding fugitive slaves under an arrest for larceny— The case of
								<persRef ref="latimer-george">George Latimer</persRef> has been
							ultimately compounded by the payment of 400 dollars to the claimant of
							him, <persRef ref="gray-james3">Gray</persRef>.— But this is not the
							proper conclusion to that transaction— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="mann-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann</persRef> at
							Natick, fixing upon next Saturday Evening for my lecture there— Spent

						<p>It was this morning so cold that I was unable to write before breakfast,
							and finished reading an Article in the North American review for October
							of a new publication of th correspondence of <persRef ref="pitt-william"
								>Lord Chatham</persRef>; the Article, is a very good one and was
							written by <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>; as was also

							first of the name on this continent—And happening to look into one of
							the book cases in Charles’s Study, my hand guided by some instinct for
							which I cannot account, chanced to alight on a volume of Tracts,
							belonging to him, on opening which the first thing that met my eye was
							the opinion of the late judge of the Supreme Court of the United States,
								<persRef ref="johnson-william">William Johnson</persRef> of
							South-Carolina pronouncing the negro act of that State, for imprisoning
							coloured seamen arriving in the State, unconstitutional— At the last

								>President</persRef> calling for copies of a correspondence on this
							subject at the Department of State, and particularly of this opinion of

							received 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> March last in which, furnishing
							the correspondence, and adding in so many words “I am not informed of
							the existence of any official opinion of the late judge Johnson on the
							unconstitutionality of the act or acts of the State of South Carolina,
							upon the subject referred to in the resolution”— I had been two years
							eagerly searching for this opinion, when it was now so unexpectedly cast
							in my way. I took it to the emancipator Office and showed it to <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef>, who promised to publish it in the paper together
							with the Document 119. But I wished to have them also both published in
							a paper of wider circulation, and took the volume to the Atlas Office,
							and proposed to <persRef ref="hayden-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hayden</persRef> the publication of them in that paper,
							observing at the same time that I did not wish to press the request upon
							him, if it would be adverse to the political course of the paper— He
							said he would without hesitation publish them. I went again to obtain
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt the document 119. but he had
							lent his two copies of it; and promised to bring me one of them this
							afternoon— He came, but had not yet recovered it, and promised it again
							for to-morrow morning. <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.

							and that of <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan to understand the precise effect
							of these last communications which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Curtis, who has the possessions of the papers agreed to do— I told M<hi

							and <persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Fuller</persRef>, with his counsel <persRef ref="washburn-emory"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Washburn</persRef>, at the
							probate office last Monday— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis was of

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston to renounce the claim to set off
							the note of <persRef ref="gill-moses">Moses Gill</persRef> to her from
							the amount to be paid to Fuller as Gill’s administrator, on account of
							the first Moses Gill’s share of the monies recovered from the French
							Government in the name and right of Thomas Boylston. I am myself of the
							same opinion: believing that although the money of the note was loaned
							in advance of the expected recovery from the French Government, and
							ought therefore to be deducted from it, yet as this does not appear on
							the face of the note, it would be impossible to prove it judicially in a
							suit at law,—and as by the total depretiation of the Stock in the Bank
							of the United States, the whole sum of nearly 1000 dollars has dwindled
							down to less than 30. the cost of a suit even in chancery or by an
							arbitration would exceed tenfold the amount recovered should it even
							terminate favourably to the claim of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Boylston. I finally concluded to make an effort to see her at Providence
							next Friday.— After a conference of two hours with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis I called to see my old Classmate
								<persRef ref="putnam-samuel">judge Putnam</persRef> at his house in
							Essex Street N. 10. but he was not at home— I made unsuccessful attempts

								<persRef ref="percival-john">Captain Perceval</persRef> whom I

								<persRef ref="steele-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Steele</persRef>— Captain Perceval had minutes of several abuses in

							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Steele had sent me a huge budget of
							prosing Letters, in support of a claim of <persRef ref="steele-william2"
								>his father</persRef> for a revolutionary pension—between them they
							laid me fairly asleep—as if it had been by animal magnetism— I paid an
							evening visit at <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>A crevice in one of the corners at the top of one of the closed
							window-shutters of the bed-chamber in which I slept, let in day light
							this morning and reminded me that my rising hour was long past, and I
							rose little before the Sun— It was pouring with rain, which continued
							steadily all the morning, till about 2 in the afternoon when it turned
							to snow with a heavy gale, the thermometer continuing to fall, till
							after Sunset when it cleared up—cold with bright star-light— At 11. A.M.
							I attended with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my sons</persRef>, and his
							two sons <persRef ref="adams-john17">John</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7">Charles</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef> church and heard him preach from Ezekiel
							34.25. “And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
							the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in
							the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 26. And I will make them, and
							the places round about my hill, a blessing; and I will cause the shower
							to come down, in his season: there shall be showers of blessing. 27. And
							the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield
							her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that
							I am the Lord”— he omitted the remainder of the verse—“when I have
							broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of
							those that served themselves of them.” The sermon was a beautiful
							exposition of the causes of gratitude to God, binding upon the people of
							this union, the last clause of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verse having been purposely avoided I suppose to exclude from the
							discourse any direct reference to the revolutionary War of Independence—
							The first hymn that he gave out to be sung was the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef> Christian Psalter,
							being my version of the 67<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— Nothing
							could be more appropriate to the occasion;—but I pray for the
							forgiveness of God, for the sensation with which I heard my verses
							forming a part of the grateful devotions of a Christian assembly of
							worshipers.— The auditory was very thin the severity of the weather
							keeping almost every body housed at home— We all dined at <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks’s</persRef>, the party, excepting myself, consisting entirely
							of his children, their wives, husbands and children to the number of

								<persRef ref="brooks-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> but with <persRef

						<p>Finished the record of yesterday before breakfast, as I ought to do every
							day, and do very seldom— Received a budget of Letters, sent in by
							<persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Kirk</persRef> from Quincy, but none of which I have time to answer—
							I spent two hours in reading a bundle of Letters sent me by <persRef

								Steele</persRef> as evidences of the equity of the claim of his
							father <persRef ref="steele-william2">William Steele</persRef>, to a
							pension of services, in the revolutionary war. Chiefly Letters from his
							father to him from 1825 down to this month— He has a petition before the
							House of Representatives presented in 1837. and to which he desires me
							to give such aid as may be in my power.— After breakfast I took the
							papers excepting the Letter, with the copy of his petition to his son’s
							lodgings 20. Mount Vernon street; and not finding him there, afterwards
							to his counting house in Pearl street, where I returned them to him— I
							called at the shop of <persRef ref="poole-lott">Poole</persRef> the
							Tailor, with the new coat he had sent me; so much too small that he said
							he could do nothing with it; but would make me another, which he would
							send me next Monday evening or Tuesday morning— I left with <persRef
								ref="hayden-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayden</persRef>
							of the Boston Atlas the Document 119. on the South Carolina Negro-Laws
							which together with the opinion of <persRef ref="johnson-william">judge
								Johnson</persRef>, I had left with him before, he promised should be
							published next Tuesday— <persRef ref="brewer-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brewer</persRef> told me he intended
							going to Washington shortly after Christmas, and would be glad to
							receive from me, any communication for the paper— I returned to <persRef
								ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef> the document N. 119. which he had lent me— He
							spoke somewhat doubtfully of his going to Washington this winter— After
							a visit to the globe Bank I finally found the custom-house, and saw the
							collector <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Levi Lincoln</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef> the Naval
							Officer— Governor Lincoln went with me to the new unfinished granite
							building where I met <persRef ref="young-ammi">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ammi Burnham Young</persRef>, the Architect, and
								<persRef ref="robinson-jonathan3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Robinson</persRef> the Secretary of the Commissioners for
							constructing the building, who had written me, requesting me to visit
							the work— It is a solid mass of granite, even to the roof, upon which I
							went up, and the like of which I never saw before—the interior of the
							building and three fourths of the roof are yet unfinished; the iron
							window frames have an air of lightness. The building stands upon piles,
							at the head of Long wharf, and looks as if it would sink them. Returning
							home I found <persRef ref="palfrey-john;palfrey-mary">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Palfrey </persRef>and <persRef ref="palfrey-sara">their

							to Providence where I arrived at half past 5. <persRef

								Dunnell</persRef> met me at the depot and took me to the city hotel.
							At 7. I delivered the Lecture— Then went to <persRef ref="boylston-john"

							I dined; walked to the depot, opposite the United States Hotel, and
							precisely at 3 started in the train for Worcester— At Natick I alighted,
							16 miles from Boston 10 minutes short of 4— <persRef ref="wilson-henry5"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Wilson</persRef> was
							there, ready to receive me—And took me at once in a one horse Chaise to

								>his wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="howe-mary2">her mother</persRef>

						<dateline>Natick. Sunday 27. November 1842— Boston</dateline>
						<p><date>27. VII. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>In traveling yesterday from Boston to Natick the cars had scarcely
							reached Cambridge when they met a powdering of snow on the sides of the
							road; and this increased as we proceeded till on reaching Natick, the
							ground was wholly covered with frozen glassy Snow, which the Sun in a
							clear sky has not in two days been sufficient to thaw— This morning I
							was unable to rise before day light, having slept in a cold chamber and
							the morning continuing frosty, and showering snow— I rose with the Sun,
							breakfasted with <persRef ref="wilson-henry5">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wilson</persRef> and his family, several of his
							neighbours, men and women came in after breakfast, till a quarter past
							10. when I took leave of <persRef ref="wilson-harriet">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wilson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="howe-mary2">her mother</persRef>, and he walked with me to the
							Railway Station— Punctually at half past ten the train of Cars from
							Worcester came up, and in one of them I returned to Boston, with
							alternate snow and sunshine, on the way— <persRef ref="ripley-james2"
								>Major Ripley</persRef> from the Springfield Armoury was the only
							acquaintance whom I met in the Cars, and I did not recognize him till he
							spoke to me, and reminded me of his visit to me last winter— We reached
							Boston at half past 11 before the close of the morning service, but too
							late to attend it— I returned to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house, and after dinner heard at <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef> church an Irish man named <persRef
								ref="giles-henry">Giles</persRef>, deformed in person, with a
							beautiful mind— His discourse was from John 4.24 [“]God is a Spirit; and
							they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.” The
							sermon was written in elegant language— It was upon the object and
							character of public worship. It was composed in the spirit of Christian
							Charity and social affection. But with some singularity of doctrine— It
							contained a parallel between the importance of preaching and of prayer;
							assigning a most decided preference for prayer, and quoting an extract
							from an English episcopalian writer, an argument to that point, with
							concurrence and approbation— He read his own prayer before the Sermon—
							Extemporaneous or formulary prayer is one of the most controverted
							points of dissent between the Episcopal and the congregational churches,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Giles’s preference of prayer over
							preaching seemed uncongenial to a congregational unitarian pulpit—
							Christ prescribed a form of prayer of universal application— <persRef
								ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> did the same; and those two forms
							embrace every thing, for which any human being under any circumstances
							need to pray—but social prayer, in prescribed forms becomes a mechanical
							exercise of Memory in which the heart has no concern. Returning from
							Church we encountered a Nova-Zemblan, Northwestern blast against which
							it was scarcely possible to make head. We spent the Evening at <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks’s</persRef>, to and from whose house <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								<persRef ref="brooks-peter2;brooks-susan">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Brooks</persRef>, and <persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward
								Brooks’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="brooks-francis">son</persRef>, constituted the company—
							There was an oyster supper of which I freely partook and at half-past
							nine we came home.</p>

							I can perform or not— He enquired, whether they might engage some other
							person, conditionally to deliver the address in the event of my failure,
							with the understanding that I will be the performer if I can, and to
							this I consented— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>
							came from Quincy this morning, and <persRef ref="johnson-william4"
								>William C. Johnson</persRef> came in from the Law-school at
							Cambridge— They dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef> at <persRef key="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef>
							house 57 Mount Vernon Street— Immediately after dinner Isaac-Hull Adams
							and myself took leave of Charles and his family and of William C.
							Johnson, and rode to the Rail-road Cars for Stonington— On entering the
							car I found <persRef ref="waters-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Isaac Waters</persRef> whom I recognized by his voice, taking leave
							of <persRef ref="u">his daughter</persRef> a girl under 20, who was
							going to West Point in the State of New-York. We started from Boston
							precisely at 4. crossed the river at Providence just before 6 and passed
							from the Cars to the Steamer Rhode-Island Captain<space/>about half-past
							eight at Stonington. I escorted Miss Waters to the Ladies cabin and saw
							her no more. <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> U.S.
							Senator and <persRef ref="fessenden-william">William P.
								Fessenden</persRef> Representative from Maine were with us in the
							Cars.</p>

						<p>We found <persRef ref="cranston-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cranston</persRef> one of the Representatives in congress from the
							State of Rhode-Island on board the Steamer at Stonington.— The Night was
							clear and fine. The Northwest gale had abated; but the cold continued
							pinchingly severe— Our passage was as smooth a one as I ever experienced
							through the sound, and I had the rare good fortune to sleep five hours
							of the Night. When I rose at half past 4. the stars were yet bright in
							the sky Calisto was in her perpendicular position pointing downward to
							Arcturus, and the prospect was of another clear cold day—but as the dawn
							advanced it clouded up and the sky was overcast, when at 7 a.m. the Sun
							just rising we reached the wharf next to the battery, while the Steamer
							of the line for Amboy was loosening from it, and we lost our passage by
							her— Ten minutes sooner we should have saved it— <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> saw our baggage transferred
							to the ferry boat office for the 9 O’Clock line, and we went and
							breakfasted at the Astor house— There we met <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Granger</persRef>, and <persRef ref="boardman-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boardman</persRef> of New-Haven—member
							from Connecticut.— At 9. we crossed the ferry at Paulus hoek, and took
							to the Cars— At or near Newark we took in <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef>, who had lost his passage yesterday by five
							minutes of detention and polite gallantry to Ladies— We were not an hour
							from New-York when it began to snow, as it continued to do till our
							arrival at Camden about 3. and there we were detained a full hour in the
							ferry-boat snow falling, and a gale blowing all the time— I had promised
							to go on with General Scott to Baltimore this Evening—but the delay for
							the transportation and delivery of our baggage was so great, that we had
							probably lost the chance for the evening train for Baltimore, and I
							concluded to take lodgings for the Night at <persRef ref="jones-john10"
								>Jones’s</persRef> Union Hotel in Chesnut Street— Here I found as
							boarders <persRef ref="stanly-edward">Edward</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stanly-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stanly</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jones-jacob">Commodore Jones</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="morris-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Commodore
								<unclear>Morris</unclear></persRef> and <persRef ref="u">her daughter</persRef>, who
							had been with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Harper</persRef> fellow travellers with us in the Cars from New-York
							and we knew nothing of it: We got in just in time for dinner at the
							Ladies ordinary at 4. O’Clock— I wrote a note and receipt to <persRef
								ref="rundle-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Rundle</persRef> requesting payment of the amount due on the
							certificates of 600 dollars in the Schuylkill permanent bridge, which I
							had left with him in September— I sent the note by Isaac-Hull but he put
							him off with a demand to know in what bills I desired payment to be
							made— I spent the Evening after tea with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>Stanly— <persRef ref="connell-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> came in and
							spent part of it with us. I gave him 3 coupons of 30 dollars each
							payable on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month as
							interest on the City of Cincinnati bonds, which he promised to receive
							and transmit to me. The Snow ceased early this evening, and was followed
							by heavy rain—</p>
