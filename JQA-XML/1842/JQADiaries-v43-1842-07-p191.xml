						<p>Met at 9 this morning the select committee on the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef> Message, informing the House
							of Representatives that he had caused to be deposited in the Office of
							the Secretary of State, an exposition of his reasons for giving his
							sanction to the apportionment Act— Present Adams, <persRef

								ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>— <persRef ref="pope-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope</persRef> did not attend. I
							presented a Resolution, which I proposed the Chairman of the Committee
							should be directed to offer to the house, calling upon the <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef> to bring or
							transmit to the house of the exposition of the reasons for his approving
							and signing the apportionment act, deposited in the office of the
							Secretary of State, accompanying the Bill— There was little debate on
							the subject in committee— Proffit said he would prefer asking for a
							copy—voted against the Resolution, and asked if I should have any
							objection to a counter minority report— I said, certainly not— I
							reserved my own unfinished report till the purport of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler’s reasons shall have been
							ascertained— In the house immediately after the reading of the journal,
							and two or three other intrusions, I presented the Resolution as
							directed by the Committee; which was opposed first by Proffit, who
							doubted the power of this house to send to a public department for an
							original paper or document, and then by <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> who maintained that the house had no right to
							send for an original paper to a public department in its judicial
							capacity.— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> enquired what was the object of the committee in
							proposing to send for the paper— I answered that the house might know
							what the paper was, and what it contained.— He said he should then vote
							for the Resolution, and with some other remarks did so— I called for the
							yeas and nays on Cushing’s amendment, which was carried 94 to 80. a
							close party vote of 80 democrats 6 of the guard and 8 whig deserters—
							The resolution was then adopted without a division.— <persRef
								ref="white-joseph3">Joseph L. White</persRef> had in his speech
							yesterday charged <persRef ref="morris-calvary">Calvary Morris</persRef>
							one of the deserters from the whig ranks to the guard, with frequent

							this day to make an explanation— That he had been disabled by painful
							and dangerous cramps in his stomach—whereupon White said that if he had
							known that he would not have made the charge, and he withdrew it. The
							temporary tariff veto bill then came up— <persRef ref="smith-william14"
								>William Smith</persRef> rattled his hour in honor of the compromise
							and the veto and baited <persRef ref="granger-francis">granger</persRef>
							into a catechism, of question and answer, which Granger would have done

							O’Clock—when <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>
							moved to adjourn over to Tuesday— The yeas and nays were called; I voted
							no—two or three others did the same. Tillinghast withdrew his motion and
							the house adjourned— After dinner I walked in the President’s grounds to
							hear the music of the marine corps band— Met there <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>I attended public worship this morning, in that hall of the house of
							representatives— <persRef ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tustin</persRef> made the prayer and sung the hymn— A
							stranger, young theologian preached from what he called the Letter of
								<persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>
							to the Hebrews 10.9. “Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.”—
							There is much of the obscurity in this text, charged upon the writings
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul—though it is not entirely clear
							that this epistle was written by him— It does not like all the rest of
							Paul’s epistles, begin by announcing the writer in his own name, and
							does not after the manner of Paul devote much of the Epistle to himself
							and his own concerns— It begins by declaring in the most emphatic manner
							Jesus Christ infinitely above not only all preceding prophets but even
							all the angels in heaven. Only Son of God— God himself <hi rend="italic"
								>by inheritance</hi>, and by whom God made the worlds. And upon this
							foundation is raised the argument that Christianity has superseded the
							Levitical law—that the crucifixion of Jesus, by one sacrifice of blood,
							made an atonement for the sins of all mankind past, present and to come,
							and abolished all other expiatory sacrifices of Bulls and goats, and
							sheep and pigeons, which the Mosaic law required to be continually
							repeated, and of which the apostle says, it is not possible that they
							should take away sins— Our preacher gave us a small dose of the usual
							galimatias about the atonement, and an abridge narrative of the
							crucifixion. There were certainly not one hundred auditors present.—
							After the hall was cleared out <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gentry-meredith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gentry</persRef> severally came to my seat to converse with me— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leavitt soon withdrew, and Gentry most
							earnestly entreated me to make a speech to-morrow on the monthly tariff
							veto— and he urged me specially to make it to-morrow— I have had so many
							applications to the same effect, that I can no longer resist, and must
							commit my cause to Heaven, with a supplication that nothing may pass my
							lips injurious to the cause itself or unworthy of me— When I came home I
							found <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott Lawrence</persRef> at my house. I enquired of him the state
							of the negotiation— He said not so promising as he could wish— They had
							received a projet from <persRef ref="baring-alexander">Lord
								Ashburton</persRef> respecting the Northeastern boundary—they had
							sent him through the Secretary in return their projet— But the <persRef
								ref="otis-john4;kavanagh-edward;kent-edward">Commissioners from
								Maine</persRef> were tenacious upon trifles— Lord Ashburton was
							tenacious upon trifles—much more so than he had appeared to be when he
							first came.— He had recently received instructions from home, and had
							intimated that they tied him up, far beyond those he had brought with
							him; and even that if they had prescribed to him before he left home, he
							would not have accepted the mission— Clouds are thickening around us—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence said he would see me again,
							shortly. And he too urged me warmly to make a speech on the Tariff-bill
							veto— I was again this afternoon detained from church by a heavy
							thunder-gust which came up precisely at the time of meeting, and spent
							the Evening in making hasty minutes for a speech to-morrow.</p>

								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> when Vice President of
							the United States at Philadelphia in 1796.— He had much conversation and
							declared his approbation of my course in Congress— His visit detained me
							so that on reaching the house I found <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Robert M. T. Hunter</persRef>, fretting out his hour speech in
							support of the little tariff veto, and in personal justification of the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>. When he finished
								<persRef ref="cooper-james2">James Cooper</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							took the floor— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost
								Johnson</persRef> urged him to yield for a motion to adjourn— Cooper
							declined, and spoke an hour against the President and the veto— <persRef
								ref="saunders-romulus">Romulus M. Saunders</persRef> followed in a
							violent invective against the whig, which includes the whole compass of
							his conceptions. There is not a more cankered or venomous reptile in the
							country— <persRef ref="marshall-thomas3">Thomas F. Marshall</persRef> of
							Kentucky, came next, with a splendid hour speech against the veto,
							enlarging into more general considerations, embracing the State debts
							and the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands— I had risen to
							take the floor several times without success and felt very aukward and
							reluctant to take it while the impression of Marshall’s speech was
							bearing so heavily upon the house— I took it nevertheless, and began by
							a compliment to Marshall which disarmed him of his resentment so that
							immediately after I finished he came and offered me his hand— Of the
							hasty minutes which I had noted last evening I followed the course of
							about one quarter part through and was cut off from my argument just as
							I began to examine the veto message— The previous question was
							immediately afterwards moved and after much struggling was carried—
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> whom I had somewhat
							annoyed by exposing his unconstitutional doctrines was excessively
							anxious to reply— W. C. Johnson and <persRef ref="sprigg-james"
								>Sprigg</persRef> asked to be excused from voting, for the purpose
							of making short speeches and then withdrew their motions. Sprigg reared
							up and kick’d up his hind heels like a rampart colt— The vote upon the
							bill was 114 to 97. Not two thirds, and of course was lost— The report
							of the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of State</persRef>, with
							a copy of the President’s reasons for signing the apportionment Bill,
							was presented by the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> to the

							Committee— But <persRef ref="campbell-john7">John Campbell</persRef> was
							gravid with a speech and an adjournment was moved and carried— Visit
							from <persRef ref="brown-george2">George Brown</persRef>— Evening with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">the Ladies</persRef> at

								ref="cass-lewis">Cass’s</persRef> protest against the ratification
							by France of the Quintuple Treaty But Everett himself in offering it

							pretended that the house had no more right to call upon the President,

							proposed project for a lure of Steampackets between Havre and New-York

							with lordly but blushing contempt of the paltry pittance of one percent
							commission of one percent upon whatever might be recovered upon the
							Virginia Military Land-warrant claims—but his tone towards Hall was
							changed from over bearing insolence to humble courtesy— The Resolution
							for the appointment of a select investigating committee of the Virginia
							Military bounty Land-warrants was then adopted with the proposed
							amendments, and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> moved
							to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the

							called on me this morning with a recommendatory Letter from <persRef
								ref="davis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Nathaniel M.
								Davis</persRef> of Plymouth. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murdock
							has been many years a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts and was
							Postmaster at Carver from 1832. to 1839. when he was removed by <persRef
								ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef>, and a politician named
								<persRef ref="ward-eliab">Ward</persRef> appointed in his place— He
							has now a petition from inhabitants of Carver for his restoration; but
							his main anxiety is to prevent the removal of the Post-office from its
							present location, which the present officer will soon be obliged to do.
							I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murdock, and presented him to
							the <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Postmaster general</persRef>, with
							a strong recommendation, and a statement of the grounds of his
							application— I then left them and came to the House, and found <persRef
								ref="mason-john10">John Thompson Mason</persRef> in superlatively
							dull discourse against the tariff bill.— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> had been
							bustling with a Resolution to prohibit any motion to adjourn before 6.
							O’Clock p.m. every day till next Tuesday— It was ultimately laid over
							one day under the rule— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost
								Johnson</persRef> followed and employed his hour in unfolding his
							plan for assuming the debts of the States, or a large portion of them—
							He promised to bring out his plan more fully hereafter— Then <persRef
								ref="gamble-roger">Roger L. Gamble</persRef> of Georgia replied to
							the furious assault of his colleague <persRef ref="cooper-mark">Mark A.
								Cooper</persRef>— There was some sparring between them— Cooper
							denied that he had formed any Coalition with the <persRef
								ref="tyler-john">Tyler</persRef> party— Gamble alluded to a toast
							given by Charles J. Ingersoll at a dinner given by the President to his
							partizans last Monday— Veto and ditto. And to two other political cross
							fire toasts given at a Tyler and a democratic party at Philadelphia last
							Monday— <persRef ref="payne-william3">Payne</persRef> of Alabama
							pronounced an hour of invective against protection— <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> came next with a strong
							protection speech, and in defence of himself for having signed the whig
							manifesto at the close of the last Session of Congress— He alluded also
							to the compromise of 1833, but very feebly, and with his ordinary
							timorous reserve— <persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef>,
							one of the corporal’s guard made a Pittsburg Iron-tariff speech of an
							hour—till 4 O’Clock— <persRef ref="black-edward">Black</persRef> of
							Georgia then got the floor, and moved the Committee to rise, but the
							Chairman urged him to keep hold of Time by the forelock, and made his
							speech which he did, now, all in petulant invective against the Georgia
							whigs, and especially Gamble.— <persRef ref="brown-milton">Milton Brown
							</persRef>of Tennessee, finally closed the debate for the day, by a half
							Tariff hour speech— <persRef ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of
							Mississippi, moved the committee to rise. Sundry bills from the Senate
							were then read and referred among which was the appropriation for the
							remainder of the Massachusetts claim. Adjourned at a quarter past 6—

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Turner after the death of <persRef

							out; after which she had engaged to attend in the store of a large

							owing to the total stagnation of business in that city— She had recently
							received a proposal from a person named <persRef ref="newhall-ezra">E.

							in a Store number 141. Washington Street— She was inclined to accept

							proposing a joint establishment by the Governments of the United States
							and of France of a line of weekly Steamers between Havre and New-York—
							The impression against this measure seemed unanimous. Reason was piled

							to prepare a report against the proposal— I said I must request that
							another member should be charged with that report, for I was for
							accepting the proposal.— What a startling! What were my reasons? I gave
							them. Everett now was for giving a courteous answer and calling on the

								ref="maffitt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef>,
							after an absence of five weeks— It was announced in the Globe last
							evening that he was to preach on “the moral aspects of the 19<hi

							“And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice
							of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying Alleluia;
							for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.” The discourse was a rhapsodical
							declamation upon the moral improvements of the age—Sunday
							Schools—Bible—Tract—Missionary and Temperance Societies— But no
							abolition—not even colonization— Not one word on the subject of Slavery
							or emancipation. Oh! no! we never mention her! M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Maffitt gave notice that he should preach in the Hall, next

							Mexican Secretary of State, bitterly complaining of the toleration by

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer says that Velazquez styles himself
							Chargé d’Affaires but has never presented himself as such, or with any
							credentials at the Department of State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster wished for my advice, and thought it most expedient that there
							should be a call from the house for the Documents. He would answer the
							two notes from Bocanegra to-morrow— I had a long conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer, in which his opinion of the
							present prospects of the negotiation with <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">Lord Ashburton</persRef> were more favourable
							than I believe the facts will warrant— After dinner, at S<hi

							read the evening service for the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday

							Absent <persRef ref="shepperd-augustine">Shepperd</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="meriwether-james2">Meriwether</persRef>.— The Steam Packet line
							Negotiation was passed over. <persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van

							next. The Letter from the <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, with the enclosed note from the <persRef
								ref="fourier-louis">French Minister de Bacourt</persRef> and other
							documents relating to the claim of the house of La Fitte were debated
							till the house-bell rang, but no conclusion— In the house, I offered a
							Resolution in two clauses, calling on the <persRef ref="tyler-john"
								>President</persRef> for the diplomatic correspondence with Mexico,
							and with Texas— It was no sooner read than <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> started up, and said he had
							no objection to the first branch of my Resolution, but he had to the
							second, whereupon <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore
							</persRef>insisted that if debate was to arise it must lie over— I then
							intreated that the question might be taken on the first branch of my
							resolution the call for correspondence with Mexico— <persRef
								ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W. Andrews</persRef> now came in
							savage as a famished wolf, called for the reading of my resolution and
							objected to the reception, and the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef> sustained him in his objection— I called for a
							suspension of the rules and demanded the yeas and nays, which were
							ordered— Thereupon Andrews withdrew his objection—the question was taken
							on the first branch of my resolution, which was adopted with scarcely a
							negative voice— Pickens still objected to the second branch of my
							resolution— I extorted from the Speaker a promise that it should be
							taken up at my call to-morrow morning, and then submitted to its lying
							over.— Fillmore then moved a Resolution, postponing the territorial
							business assigned for tomorrow, and the two succeeding days, till the
							first three days of next week, and postponing the final question, on the
							Tariff bill, till Friday next at 12. O’Clock, allowing from this day at
							Noon till then for amendments of detail, each mover of an amendment, to
							have 15 minutes and any one member 10 minutes to oppose it.— This
							resolution he finally carried through by two successive suspensions of
							the rules— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob Thompson</persRef> then
							made a foolish hour speech and <persRef ref="cary-george3">George B.
								Cary</persRef> of Southampton, Virginia a remnant of twenty minutes
							till noon, when down came the Chairman’s hammer— And the commenced the

								<persRef ref="lee-john4">John Lee</persRef>, till the close of the

						<p>After a call at the Office of the National Intelligencer, to ask for
							their paper of 2. December last, which I did not obtain, I barely
							reached the Hall of the house, while <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef> was saying grace
							over the coming deliberations of the day. The instant <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef>, the sub clerk had closed the
							reading of yesterday’s journal I started up with the shrill cry—<persRef
								ref="white-john6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker!</persRef>—
							But <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> who had stationed
							himself in the lane right opposite the chair caught his eye, and got the
							floor.— He moved a reconsideration of the vote of mercy to the stable
							keeper <persRef ref="lee-john4">John Lee</persRef>, snatched from the
							good nature of the house last evening by <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef>. Cave launched out into lamentations and
							indignations, with a direct thrust at <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>Briggs</persRef> who was last evening in the Speakers chair, for
							putting the question to spare John Lee for this Session, without heeding
							his Cave’s fiery remonstrances. Cave’s motion for reconsideration was
							first met with the objection, that he having voted in the minority and
							against the resolution could not move a reconsideration; but he
							persisted in scolding, till <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef>
							a brother radical, who had voted as he said for the resolution, took
							pity on Cave and moved the reconsideration— And now Cave flourished away
							upon retrenchment and reform—the uselessness of the services of the
							Stable keeper John Lee, and the fortune he was heaping up, by hiring out
							to other people his six horses.— Cave demanded the yeas and nays upon
							the reconsideration, and it was carried 79 to 70.— Then upon the
							Resolution itself which was again carried 84 to 80. and so this mountain
							of patriotic parsimony was delivered of its mouse.— An hour and a half
							had been consumed in this trifling, and my second shriek of “M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker!” brought him to. I called up the
							second branch of my Resolution offered yesterday; the call for the
							correspondence with Texas— <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef> feebly objected; said he would not press his
							objection, but did press it, and called piteously on any member of the
							Committee of foreign affairs to help him.— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> started up and moved to go into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union— I said if my colleague wishes to
							suppress information, tis time to call at least for the yeas and
							nays—there were barely enough rose to obtain them— I said it was for the
							sole purpose of taking the question on my resolution. Cushing called me
							to order, and said “no debate”! and he carried his motion 99 to 74. half
							the house not knowing what was the alternative. <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> took the chair— I was
							boiling with indignation, but suppressed my feelings and submitted in
							silence— They skirmished upon the tariff-bill till 4. O’Clock, when the
							Committee rose— I instantly called up my Resolution again and moved the
							previous question— Pickens was gone— Cushing was silent— <persRef
								ref="thompson-jacob">Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi moved to
							adjourn—refused. <persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef>
							questioned whether the Resolution was in order. The Speaker said it was—
								<persRef ref="snyder-john">Snyder</persRef> called for the yeas and
							nays—refused, and my resolution was adopted with an almost universal
							shout. The house immediately afterwards adjourned— I left the draught of
							my Report on the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President’s</persRef>
							Message, relating to the apportionment Bill to be copied in the Clerk’s
							Office, and walked about half way home— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Mary

						<p>Meeting at 9 O’Clock of the select Committee on the <persRef

							to the house that he had caused to be deposited in the Office of the
							Secretary of State, accompanying the apportionment act, an exposition of

								>Pope</persRef>— Absent <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Hunter</persRef> and <persRef ref="proffit-george"
								>Proffit</persRef>— I read the remainder of my report, about half of
							which I had read at the last meeting— It concludes with a Resolution
							protesting against this act of the President, and against its ever being
							adduced as a precedent hereafter— M’Kennon concurred entirely with the
							report— Pope agreed to its being presented to the house, but not to the
							report itself— He had voted against the districting section in the Bill,
							and had voted to lay on the table the motion to refer the message to a
							select Committee— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> had as usual
							brow-beaten the <persRef ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> by the base
							insinuation that he would appoint a Committee of the bitterest enemies,
							of the President, and they would report violent measures, the result of
							which would be to raise the President to the very pinnacle of
							popularity, and to prostrate the whig party forever— The Speaker as
							usual cowered under Wise’s scourge, and appointed 3 out of 5. members of
							the Committee, Tylerites.— Proffit at the last meeting asked me, if I
							should have any objection to a counter-report—to which I answered, none
							in the world. The House went immediately after the reading of the
							Journal went into committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							M’Kennon in the chair on the details of the Tariff Bill— The day was
							consumed in numberless motions of amendment, a very large portion of
							them mere chicanery to waste time and throw obstacles in the way of the
							passage of the Bill— About 4. O’Clock this tiresome foolery was
							superseded by the rising of the Committee— <persRef ref="beeson-henry"
								>Beeson</persRef> then offered an amendment to strike out the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section, the land distribution and
							insert three sections, as a substitute, to levy stamp duties on Notes
							and Bank bills— Objection was made— Beeson moved a suspension of the
							rules, the objection was withdrawn, and Beeson’s amendment was laid on
							the table and ordered to be printed— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> gave notice that he would next Monday ask leave to
							introduce a Bill to reduce the pay and mileage of the members of
							Congress.— The Speaker presented a Message from the President, with the
							correspondence with Mexico, in answer to the first branch of my
							resolution adopted by the house last Monday— It was read, ordered to be
							printed and referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs— The Speaker
							presented also certain Resolutions of the whig, <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, anti-Tyler committee at New York—
							Objection was made to their being received, and the house fell into
							confusion, in which a motion to adjourn was carried. There had been
							thunder part of the day, and the remainder of it was showery— <persRef

						<p>Meeting of the Committee of foreign Affairs— The Resolution of the house

								>r</hi> Cushing read about one half of a long report upon Van Ness’s
							Accounts; on which conversational debate arose as he proceeded—item by
							item till we were obliged to adjourn—to attend the house— Everett moved
							and we agreed to meet again and finish this business to-morrow Morning—
							In the house, I attempted to get the floor to present my report on the
							apportionment bill message, but failed. Cushing on account of pressure
							of the tariff bill on which the debate was to cease at 12 O’Clock, moved
							to go immediately into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—
								<persRef ref="moore-john3">Moore</persRef> of Louisiana, at the same
							time asked leave to offer two new Sections to the tariff bill, and to
							have them printed; alledging that they were intended to suppress
							abominable frauds in the collection of duties on sugar, and allowance of
							draw-backs on exported molasses, but no debate was allowed. Moore moved
							to suspend the rules, but it was refused— Part of Moore’s object was to
							provide that upon cotton imported from Texas and exported, only one
							percent of the duty should be retained of the drawback and that drawback
							should be allowed on all foreign goods exported by land to Texas and
							Mexico— I could not obtain the question upon the reception of my report—
							The house went into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union,
							and debated further the details of the tariff Bill, till half past 6.
							O’Clock when at <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts’s</persRef> motion, the
							Committee rose and reported the Bill; <persRef ref="bronson-david"
								>Bronson</persRef> of Maine immediately moved the previous question;
							whereupon the house immediately adjourned— <persRef ref="leggett-aaron"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aaron Leggett</persRef> one of
							the large Claimants on Mexico came to me this morning, with a memorial
							to Congress stating the facts of his claim, and invoking the
							interposition of Congress to obtain payment of it— He said he wished to
							have some conversation with me concerning it. I appointed 8 O’Clock this
							evening to see him at my house; and just as we rose from dinner he came—
							He remained with me upwards of an hour arguing with me on the duty of
							Congress either to compel Mexico to pay him or to assume and pay the
							debt for this Nation— I told him that I should be willing to give all
							proper consideration to his memorial, and to agree to any practical
							measure consistent with justice for his relief— But he complained almost
							as much, and with as much justice of this Government as of Mexico— The
							Convention for the settlement of the claims, was so wretchedly
							contrived, that its real object must have been, to multiply and
							aggravate the causes of War between the two Countries. <persRef

								ref="white-edward">White</persRef>— Cushing, concluded the reading
							of his report which was discussed, and slightly amended— It was
							accepted, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing was authorised to
							present it to the house— It substantially sustains. <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Ness’s</persRef> charges upon all the items disallowed by the
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								Auditor Pleasonton,</persRef> and the <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Secretary of State Forsyth</persRef>— They amount to upwards of
							25000 dollars in a mission of 7 years. Van Ness has raked and scraped at
							every possible table for crumbs of contingency and actually increased
							his Salary from 9 to more than 12000 dollars a year— Yet he is able to
							adduce precedent for every charge, and like a tavern-keeper, who upon
							any objection made to his bill trumps up new charges, he now claims of
							right, Salary from the day of his appointment, though notified at the
							time of his appointment, that it would begin from the time of his
							departure from home on his mission—Cushing favours all the charges,
							because he keeps a steady eye upon a mission abroad, himself— Everett
							favours them all because Van Ness is a Vermonter, with whom he sees it
							is for his interest to be well;—Granger favours most of them from the
							liberality of his spirit, but he scores out two or three of the most
							rapacious items; and the Southern economists would gladly apply the
							retrenching sickle, but wish to cast the responsibility of the operation
							upon me— Cushing’s report studiously evades the expression of an opinion
							against any one of the charges; but refers back to the executive, and
							the judicial Courts those that are glaringly illegal and iniquitious—
							The result will be the admission of them all— In the house, I presented
							the report from the select Committee on the apportionment bill message;
							and moved that it be laid on the table and printed; and that the
							Resolution at the close of the report should be read— Cushing enquired
							whether I proposed to consider the resolution now. I said no— Not until
							the report should be printed. <persRef ref="bowne-samuel"
								>Bowne</persRef> objected to its being received— I moved a
							suspension of the rules— <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef>
							moved that the Committees should be called for Reports, whereupon Bowne
							withdrew his objection to the reception of mine— It was laid on the
							table and ordered to be printed— The previous question had been moved
							last Evening, on the engrossment of the tariff-bill—there was now a
							second to the motion, but the question shall the main question be <hi
								rend="italic">now</hi> put was taken by yeas and nays, and decided
							in the negative 98 to 102.— <persRef ref="williams-christopher"
								>Christopher H. Williams</persRef> moved a reconsideration, which
							was carried 110 to 104.— The day was then consumed in taking yeas and
							nays on swarms of amendments till near 6. O’Clock— Then the bill passed
							to engrossment 116 to 111 and passed 116 to 112— Reconsideration moved
							and refused— Adjourned.</p>

							insisted upon having the question upon his taken by yeas and nays and it
							was also rejected; by a large majority— Many of the whigs, inclined to
							adopt his amendment, and it would have been very acceptable to the North
							as an avowed assertion by Congress of the protective principle, I could

								Leggett</persRef> brought this morning the manuscript report of the
							American Commissioners under the Convention with Mexico, upon his claim;
							which he requested me to present with his memorial, and to move that it
							be printed— Leggett’s original claim was one in which he had no right to
							claim the interposition of the Government of the United States— But this
							mode of intermeddling with the claims of our citizens upon foreign
							Governments has become quite familiar to us, and we have not yet very
							closely examined how far it will warrant foreign nations in
							reciprocating the practice with us.— Leggett’s claim and many others
							upon Mexico were taken up by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson’s</persRef> administration to make an offset to the
							enormous outrages of Jackson himself and his administration against
							Mexico—and when in 1837. Jackson’s project of kindling a War with
							Mexico, was baffled and defeated, he left his successor <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> to trump up a Convention,
							which he well knew would terminate in no adjustment or satisfaction of
							the claims, but leaving them, aggravated causes of War— And now these
							claims are saddled upon us, so that we cannot cast them off— At the
							meeting of the house, I attempted to offer Leggett’s memorial, with the

								Leggett</persRef> was again here this morning, enquiring about his
							memorial, with the report of the American Commissioners upon his claim;
							I told him I had attempted in vain yesterday morning to present them to

							objection from a single member is potent to prevent its reception it
							would probably not be possible to obtain its admission— Leggett was red
							hot for War till I told him that the first coup de canon would spunge
							his claim. Now he is for an armed negotiation, to purchase a slice of
							California, and especially the harbour of San Francisco, and paying for
							it with the claims. Meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs.—

							with the application of the <persRef ref="fourier-louis">French Minister

						<p>A tremendous thunder bolt last Evening, struck a poplar tree in front of

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Kearney</persRef>, at the Corner of
								14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> street, within stones throw of my
							door; and staved in one of the windows of his house. It strip’d the tree
							of a small portion of its bark on one side, with out other apparent
							damage— <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leavitt</persRef> called on me this morning. He is to leave the City
							to-morrow for Boston— He has collected for me several slips from
							newspapers relating to the affairs of Mexico and Texas, which I may want
							for debate hereafter— I am grieved that I have it not in my power to
							render useful service to this excellent man, who is of the salt of the
							earth— The woman named <persRef ref="wood-louisa">Louisa Wood</persRef>
							came again and brought a Letter from another woman named <persRef
								ref="rice-laura">Laura Rice</persRef>, complaining of ill-treatment
							by certain persons in the State of Ohio— It was apparent from the
							Letter, that the woman who wrote it was insane, and I had already strong
							suspicions that Louisa Wood, was in much the same condition— I told her
							that I considered her so, but she insisted that she was not— I said that
							at all events, I could be of no service to her or her friend from whom
							she had brought the Letter—and I advised her not to trouble herself to
							come to me again— I found the house in Session, and <persRef
								ref="edwards-john4">John Edwards</persRef> of Missouri was speaking
							against a Bill to fix the boundary between the territory of Iowa, and
							the State of Missouri.— He spoke through his hour, and when arrested by
							the chairman’s hammer struggled sometime for another hour, by moving an
							amendment thereby changing the question— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> once succeeded at the special Summer Session last
							year in this trick and spoke two hours at one time— But the chairman now
							decided that the amendment involved the same question upon which the
							member had spoken, and that he therefore could not continue his speech—
							He closed therefore by presenting an amendment substitute for the Bill,
							against which <persRef ref="dodge-augustus">Augustus C. Dodge</persRef>
							the delegate from Iowa made his hour speech.— A succession of
							territorial bills followed till a bill for establishing a new collection
							district in Florida which after debate a motion being made to reject the
							bill, the numbskull chairman <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas"
								>Gilmer</persRef> put the question whether the bill should be
							reported and pronounced it carried in the negative.— Accordingly he did
							not <hi rend="strikethrough">the bill</hi> report the bill with the
							rest— I made a question of order of it; and the <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> and Gilmer brazened it out that
							the Committee were not bound to report the bill. I advised the Speaker
							to look into Hatsell, Gilmer said there was nothing about it in <persRef

							but a half an hour left for debate, which was occupied by <persRef

								<persRef ref="irwin-william">W. W. Irwin</persRef> moved instantly

						<p>The explosion noticed yesterday sounded its first crack by <persRef
								ref="gwin-william">Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi, who announced that
							he had voted for all the reductions of the army when the bill was before

								ref="baring-alexander">Lord Ashburton</persRef>, by which a large
							portion of the Territory of the State of Maine was to be ceded to

							that the second Regiment of dragoons was the finest regiment in the
							army, and its <persRef ref="twiggs-david">Colonel (Twiggs, a

							too is now for increasing instead of reducing the army. <persRef
								ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> said he should still vote for
							reducing the army, though, if the Treaty should be such as Gwin had
							represented it he should be as much as Gwin himself against it— This
							burning patriotism for Maine is kindled at the stake prepared for
							Madison Washington— The Creole slave-traders, and the repudiating
							debtors of Mississippi, are the guardians of the sanctity of the
							territory of Maine— This debate is a premonitory symptom of acrid matter
							to come— <persRef ref="andrews-landaff">Landaff W. Andrews</persRef>
							with his March hare look, moved the Committee to rise, to stifle
							debate—the vote to rise was 38 to 44—a majority against rising, but

							20.6. last clause of the verse—“why stand ye here, all the day, idle?”
							Congress have got into so bad repute for neglect of business, that there
							appeared to be a sarcasm couched under the surface of the text— I
							suppose it was suggested by the prevailing prejudice against Congress,
							but there was no allusion to it direct or indirect in the Sermon— That
							was specially and very earnestly addressed to the members of Congress,
							and they were in bold and unmeasured terms charged with standing here
							all the day idle— I could not fail to observe the address with which he
							preserved through the whole discourse the tone of severe reproach and
							stern rebuke, and yet steered clear of every sore spot of his auditory—
							His charge of idleness was not of negligence to the affairs of this
							world, but on the contrary of excessive devotion to it. He said the
							members of Congress had no heart— They were all head, all
							intellect—absorbed and imbedded in worldly concerns, but religion must
							come from the heart, and they had no heart— Then he rang the changes for
							upwards of an hour upon the various ways of standing all the day idle,
							talked very boastfully about himself—gloried in the blessings he had
							received from an old woman, who told him that he had reclaimed a vicious
							son of hers from wickedness to virtue— He gave notice that he should
							preach the funeral Sermon of <persRef ref="cookman-george">M<hi

							dinner there was a transient thunder shower, which passed off in time

								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<dateline>Washington Monday 25 July 1842</dateline>
						<p><date>25. V. </date>Monday </p>
						<p>Upon the reading of the Journal of the House this morning, <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> observed that no notice was
							taken in it of the motion he had made on Saturday to suspend the rules
							for the introduction of his bill; which had been objected to by <persRef
								ref="saunders-romulus">R. M. Saunders</persRef> for the reduction of
							the pay and mileage of members of Congress— The <persRef
								ref="white-john6">Speaker</persRef> said the usage was not to enter
							upon the journal unsuccessful motions to suspend the rules, unless the
							yeas and nays are taken.— Arnold said he had asked the yeas and nays,
							but the house had refused them. The Speaker said the motion would be
							entered, but not the name of the objector, which is never done.—
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> called up the
							Resolution he had offered on Saturday, to take the questions on the
							amendments of the Senate to the army appropriation bill, in Committee on
							the whole of the state of the Union, this day at one O’Clock, and moved
							the previous question which was carried by yeas and nays, called for by
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> 91 to 56.— He then
							moved to go into Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.
							carried— <persRef ref="summers-george">Summers</persRef> in the chair.—
							The first amendment of the Senate struck out the proviso in the bill as
							it went from the house, reducing the army to the standard of the act of
							1821. and withholding pay from the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
							Regiment of dragoons, after the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							next September, and substituted another, and much scantier reduction—
							The question was on concurring with the amendment of the Senate,
							recommended by the chairmen of the Committees of Ways and Means,
							Fillmore, and of Military Affairs. <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> rather feebly objected to concurring in the
							Amendment and called the house to stand by its own principle of
							reduction— Ward of New-York urged an immediate decision, and said he had
							received many Letters complaining of the delay to pass the army
							appropriation Bill. <persRef ref="graham-james4">James Graham</persRef>
							of North-Carolina made a short speech against concurring with the Senate
							and <persRef ref="caruthers-robert">Caruthers</persRef> did the same— I
							assumed the same ground, and made a speech of about three quarters of an
							hour urging to the extent of my power that the house would not concur
							with the amendment of the Senate— <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef> followed me, and said when the bill had first been
							before the house he had voted against the reduction of the army, because
							during the pendency of an important negotiation, he did not think it
							proper to change the military position of the country— But since what he
							had heard from <persRef ref="gilmer-thomas">Gilmer</persRef> on
							Saturday, he believed the <persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef>
							was about to veto the Treaty now on the point of conclusion; and he
							should now vote against concurring with the Senate—an explanation was
							then made by Gilmer disclaiming any particular intercourse with the
							President but avowing the hope that the Treaty would not be ratified.
							The vote in the Committee to concur was 49 to 100. all the other
							amendments of the Senate except two were non-concurred— In the house the
							vote on the main amendment, by yeas and nays was 65 to 117— Arnold then
							moved again and obtained a suspension of the rules and introduced his
							bill— A curious scene ensued till the adjournment.</p>

							withdrew it was referred to the Committee on public expenditures, and
							ordered to be printed.— Arnold then called up his bill to reduce the
							compensation of members of Congress, and the salaries of public
							officers— The question left last evening was upon the rejection of the

							secondly 168 names in answer, then 11 excuses, and then further
							proceedings dispensed with— <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"

						<p>In the house, the morning hour was allotted to the reception of reports

							the proposal from the French Government, to establish a weekly line of

							be prepared by the Secretaries of <persRef ref="webster-daniel"

							co-operation of the Governments of the United States, with estimates of
							the expense which would be necessary for carrying the plan into

							report; and afterwards to the consideration of the Resolution, but the
							objections were finally withdrawn, and the resolution was adopted.
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stuart-alexander2">Stuart</persRef> made also the reports with

								ref="campbell-william2">W. B. Campbell</persRef> had moved to

							forming his budget of retrenchment— <persRef ref="proffit-george"
								>Proffit</persRef> moved the previous question, and while that was

							finally carried 86 to 82. Then more discussion, and half a dozen sets of
							instructions moved by different members, each utterly averse to the
							motions of all the others— At last the motion to refer the bill to a
							select Committee of 9 members— It was half past three O’Clock— I
							intreated them to take up a number of Bills from the Senate, which had
							come in this morning; and Fillmore proposed to take up the Navy
							Appropriation bill, returned with disagreements, and a request for a
							conference—but <persRef ref="botts-john">Botts</persRef> moved to

							through the night— My faculties are prostrated by the debilitating
							process of unintermitted heat, and even the daily page, languishes to

								ref="tustin-septimus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tustin</persRef> closing his morning benediction upon the house—

							go home, as <persRef ref="bowne-samuel">Bowne</persRef> said to their
							firesides— The vote for suspension was 84 to 68. a majority but not two
							thirds— The Navy-Appropriation Bill returned from the Senate insisting
							on two of their amendments disagreed to by the house was called up by
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>; the Senate
							requesting a conference on the disagreeing votes. Fillmore moved to

								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> moved to adhere

							knife too freely—as he and his friends would themselves have the
							appoints to make in the next Congress— He resisted also the
							appropriation of Salaries for the Consul at London, and for a dragoman
							at Constantinople— I explained the reason for the allowance to the
							Consul and testified to the merit of the <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas"

							and Resolutions assert in forcible terms, the right of the house to
							demand the papers, and the final Resolution contains a call upon the
								<persRef ref="tyler-john">President</persRef> for them— Upon the
							reading of the report, the house began to heave convulsively with the

							democracy— Manifested chiefly by <persRef ref="proffit-george"
								>Proffit</persRef>, and by <persRef ref="gwin-william"
								>Gwin</persRef> of Mississippi— Their objects were 1. to refuse
							reception both to the report and the resolutions. 2. to prevent their

							to the reception, but were overruled by the <persRef ref="white-john6"
								>Speaker</persRef>— They resisted the printing, upon the pretence
							that they wanted to debate the Resolutions, by which they hoped it would
							be laid over to another day and then never come up again. To meet and
							overreach these tactics Cooper was obliged to make two motions, and
							demand the previous question upon both at once 1. to print and 2. to
							adopt the Resolutions— Proffit sputtered and snapped like parched
							corn—denied the right of Cooper to offer two motions at once and call
							the previous question upon both— The Speaker decided that he had—
							Proffit moved to lay the whole subject on the table—yeas and nays 58 to
							101—previous question carried 72 to 59. yeas and nays on the printing 92
							to 67. Proffit then instantly moved the orders of the day— Cooper then
							offered to withdraw the previous question, upon the motion to adopt the
							Resolutions, but this he had no right to do— But the hour had expired,
							and <persRef ref="cowen-benjamin">Cowen</persRef> chairman of the

							under the care of <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> at Boston— Under all the temptations
							of a scorching atmosphere, for the last three weeks I have stood firm in
							resistance till yesterday, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing
							enquired of me, where I had been in the habit of bathing— In the
							house—the select committee to which <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold’s</persRef> bill for reducing the pay and mileage of members
							of Congress, and the Salaries of executive officers, reported back his
							bill with slight modifications, with a minority report and a substitute
							Bill, confined in its operation, to the members of Congress; and now
							there was a good deal of trouble about what to do with the bill, some
							being intensely desirous, as they have been from the hour of its
							introduction per saltum, without rhyme or reason, and others panting for
							a chance of chattering upon a retrenchment scheme of his own, and each
							one inflexibly opposed to every other than his own— Upwards of fifty
							members have taken part in this debate, and not one has discussed it
							with one spark of the reason and justice, appropriate to the subject.
							The bills and counterreport were finally ordered to be printed and
							referred to the Committee of the whole house on the state of the Union—
							Sundry private Bills were debated, and two or three fair pension claims,
							were defeated by the canker’d niggardliness of <persRef
								ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> of Norfolk— The Committee on
							conference upon the disagreeing votes between the two houses on the navy
							appropriation bill; <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="campbell-william2">William B. Campbell</persRef>, reported a
							compromise, by which the Senate yielded almost the whole that was in
							contest, and especially all that I had resisted; Wise had refused to
							agree to it in joint committee, but made the report, and moved its
							acceptance by the house <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> recalcitrated, but without effect— Both houses
							accepted the report and the bill is passed— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-joseph">Joseph R. Ingersoll</persRef> had brought up
							the contingent appropriation bill, at the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> reading— <persRef ref="gentry-meredith">Gentry</persRef>
							began a long prepared set speech against the bill—but soon moved to
							adjourn— Ingersoll called the yeas and nays but Arnold was in the chair
							and declared the house adjourned.</p>

						<p>I attended with my wife this morning at the hall of the house of
							Representatives, and heard <persRef ref="maffitt-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt</persRef> deliver his long
							announced funeral eulogy upon the <persRef ref="cookman-george">late
								chaplain George M. Cookman</persRef>. The house and galleries were
							crowded almost to suffocation— There was a numerous representation of
							singers from the methodist churches who began with the Anthem of [“]the
							dying christian to his soul”— [“]Vital spark of heavenly flame”— Then
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maffitt gave out <persRef
								ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> 100<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> psalm, “Before Jehovah’s awful throne” as a hymn, and at
							the close of the discourse he gave out a long hymn of his own
							composition— He was an hour and a quarter in delivering the Eulogy—the
							first three quarters of an hour moderate, rational eloquent and even
							pathetic—glowing but not gorgeous—imaginative, but not fantastical— The
							last half hour was an agonizing abortion of the sublime flashy and
							trashy, laborious and impotent.— He still commanded universal attention
							till his last word, but he drew not a single tear.— He announced that he
							should deliver the same discourse this Evening at the Wesleyan Methodist
							chapel; and that at 4. O’Clock this afternoon he should preach a charity
							sermon at another church in this city— He said that ever since he was
							honoured with the appointment of chaplain to the house of
							representatives he had felt an ardent desire to deliver this funeral
							eulogy, and he wished to have it printed to offer it as a tribute of
							affectionate consolation to <persRef ref="cookman-mary2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cookman</persRef>, and if any
							gentleman inclined to subscribe for any number of copies he would please
							to leave his name at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tucker’s</persRef>.— The text of the Eulogy was Revelation 14.13.
							“And I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the
							dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that
							they may rest from their labours: and their works do follow them.”— The
							notices of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cookman’s life, were of no
							uncommon nor yet of uninteresting events.— He was born at Hull in
							England in 1800 one of four sons of a <persRef ref="cookman-george2"
								>Wesleyian Minister</persRef> there. He had been in this Country
							since the year 1825. and had resided at several successive stations at
							various places two or three years at a time.— A fresh breeze had blown
							with a clear sky all day yesterday and all last night— This day it
							gathered in clouds and fell in showers, but in an interval I attended
							the evening service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns church.
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the prayers for the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Sunday after Trinity and preached from Acts 5.41. [“]And
							they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were
							counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 42. and daily in the
							temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus
							Christ.”— After Church, I went over and spent an hour with <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas B.
								Johnson</persRef>. When I came home I found <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott;lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef>
							had been here to take leave</p>
